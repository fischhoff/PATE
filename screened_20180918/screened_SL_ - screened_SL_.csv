Insect pollinators   play an essential functional role in terrestrial ecosystems, supporting   ecological stability and food security worldwide. Therefore, assessing   impact on pollinators is fundamental in any effort aiming at enhancing   the environmental sustainability of human production and consumption,   especially in the agri-food supply chains. Different drivers are leading   to pollinator populations' declines. Improving a supply-chain oriented   assessment of the occurrence of pressure and impacts on pollinators is   needed. However, current methodologies assessing impact along supply   chains, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), miss to assess impact on   pollinators. In fact, none of the existing life cycle impact assessment   (LCIA) models effectively accounts for pollinators. Some LCIA models   have mentioned pollination, but none has presented key drivers of impact   and a proposal for integrating pollinators as target group for   biodiversity protection within an LCIA framework. In order to devise a   pathway towards the inclusion of impacts on pollinators in LCIA, we   conducted a literature review of environmental and anthropogenic   pressures acting on insect pollinators, potentially threatening   pollination services. Based on the evidence in literature, we identified   and described eight potential impact drivers, primarily deriving from   industrial development and intensive agricultural practice: 1)   intensified land use as a result of uncontrolled expansion of urban   areas and modern agricultural practices; 2) use of pesticides; 3)   presence of invasive alien plants; 4) competition with invasive alien   pollinator species; 5) global and local climate change; 6) spread of   pests and pathogens; 7) electro-magnetic pollution and 8) genetically   modified crops. To account for these drivers in LCIA, there are specific   modeling needs. Hence, the current study provides recommendation on how   future research should be oriented to improve the current models and how   novel indicators should be developed in order to cover the existing   conceptual and methodological gaps.

This is in part due to the dilute, microscopic nature   of the planktonic microbial community, which prevents direct observation   of their interactions. Here, we use a holistic (that is, microbial   system-wide) approach to investigate time-dependent variations among   taxa from all three domains of life in a marine microbial community. We   investigated the community composition of bacteria, archaea and protists   through cultivation-independent methods, along with total bacterial and   viral abundance, and physicochemical observations. Samples and   observations were collected monthly over 3 years at a well-described   ocean time-series site of southern California. To find associations   among these organisms, we calculated time-dependent rank correlations   (that is, local similarity correlations) among relative abundances of   bacteria, archaea, protists, total abundance of bacteria and viruses and   physico-chemical parameters. We used a network generated from these   statistical correlations to visualize and identify time-dependent   associations among ecologically important taxa, for example, the SAR11   cluster, stramenopiles, alveolates, cyanobacteria and ammonia-oxidizing   archaea. Negative correlations, perhaps suggesting competition or   predation, were also common. The analysis revealed a progression of   microbial communities through time, and also a group of unknown   eukaryotes that were highly correlated with dinoflagellates, indicating   possible symbioses or parasitism. Possible `keystone' species were   evident. The network has statistical features similar to previously   described ecological networks, and in network parlance has non-random,   small world properties (that is, highly interconnected nodes). This   approach provides new insights into the natural history of microbes. The   ISME Journal (2011) 5, 1414-1425; doi:10.1038/ismej.2011.24; published   online 24 March 2011",1359,NO,SL,,,

In this work we review the reports on the occurrence of ring   pattern in different environmental conditions, the growth forms of   ring-forming plants, the mechanisms underlying ring formation, and the   consequences for species diversity at community scale. Rings formed by   83 species of clonal vascular plants have been found in grasslands,   deserts, bare substrates of lava flow, harvested peat lands, salt   marshes, and sand dunes. Four causal hypotheses have been proposed for   the emergence of ring patterns: i. occurrence of architectural   constraints for ramets development; ii. induction by fire, drought,   trampling or overgrazing; iii. nutrient and water depletion by   competition inside the ring; and iv. onset of species-specific negative   plant-soil feedback in the inner zone of the clone. Since almost all the   available studies are observations of ring structure or modelling   exercises, none of the putative mechanisms for ring formation emerged   from the literature as either generally applicable or suitable for   rejection. Therefore, long-term field experiments are needed to   investigate the relative prevalence of different mechanisms in different   environments. Ring formation bears important consequences at community   scale, because ring forming plants often act as ``nurses'', enhancing   the recruitment and development of different plant species. In fact,   ring establishment modifies above- and below-ground environmental   conditions, providing specialized safe sites for beneficiaries in the   inner zone of the clones. Such interspecific facilitation by ring   forming plants, particularly in chronically stressed environments,   contributes to increase plant species richness and can locally promote   the successional dynamics.",1361,NO,SL,,,

Floods and related   water-borne diseases were serious problems in the plains of the Lake   Tana Basin and Fogera district in particular for centuries. But with the   introduction of rice as a crop, this environmental characteristic has   become an opportunity instead of a challenge. To address the lack of   documentation about this water utilization-induced change in farming   systems in this area, and the resulting rice production and consumption   value chain, this chapter presents three survey studies conducted from   2010/11to 2014 by structured interviews of farming households and   marketing agents, field observations and group discussions supplemented   by review of literatures. Survey data was collected from 200 farming   households of high and medium level rice producing kebeles of Fogera   district selected randomly, key informant experts and a variety of value   chain actors. Participation in the rice industry in this area has   increased from 30 participant households in 2 kebeles and area coverage   of 6 ha in 1993/94 to 34,249 households in 24 kebeles covering an area   of 20,230 ha of land in 2014/15. Fogera district jumps from no   contribution in rice production before two decades to a share of 77\% of   the rice produced in Amhara and 60\% produced in all of Ethiopia. Rice   is now the primary crop in the district. In addition to rice production,   farming households have also adapted to rice consumption by innovative   value addition practices to local food items. About 82.5\% of the   respondents were rice producers, with non-producing households having no   access to irrigation; rice production is significantly related to   irrigation water utilization. These findings clarify the contribution of   water resource utilization in shifting farming systems and the value   addition practices in the area. The study has implications for how to   promote similar innovations where there are no cultural practices   related to commodities targeted by extension interventions exemplify the   impacts of proper water resource use.",1362,NO,SL,,,

For herbivorous zooplankton such as Daphnia, cyanobacteria have   poor nutritional value and some species can produce toxins affecting   zooplankton survival and reproduction. Here we present another, hitherto   largely unexplored aspect of cyanobacteria, namely that they can   increase Daphnia susceptibility to parasites. In a 12-yr monthly   time-series analysis of the Daphnia community in Greifensee   (Switzerland), we observed that cyanobacteria density correlated   significantly with the epidemics of a common gut parasite of Daphnia,   Caullerya mesnili, regardless of what cyanobacteria species was present   or whether it was colonial or filamentous. The temperature from the   previous month also affected the occurrence of Caullerya epidemics,   either directly or indirectly by the promotion of cyanobacterial growth.   A laboratory experiment confirmed that cyanobacteria increase the   susceptibility of Daphnia to Caullerya, and suggested a possible   involvement of cyanotoxins or other chemical traits of cyanobacteria in   this process. These findings expand our understanding of the   consequences of toxic cyanobacterial blooms for lake ecosystems and   might be relevant for epidemics experienced by other aquatic species.",1363,MAYBE,SL,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

We set up a greenhouse experiment to study effects of   plant competition (one- and two-species treatments), Collembola   (Heteromurus nitidus and Protaphorura armata), and AMF (Glomus   intraradices) on the performance (above- and belowground productivity   and nutrient uptake) of three grassland plant species (Lolium perenne,   Trifolium pratense, and Plantago lanceolata) belonging to three dominant   plant functional groups (grasses, legumes, and herbs). Generally, L.   perenne benefited from being released from intraspecific competition in   the presence of T. pratense and P. lanceolata. However, the presence of   AMF increased the competitive strength of P. lanceolata and T. pratense   against L. perenne and also modified the effects of Collembola on plant   productivity. The colonization of roots by AMF was reduced in treatments   with two plant species suggesting that plant infection by AMF was   modified by interspecific plant interactions. Collembola did not affect   total colonization of roots by AMF, but increased the number of   mycorrhizal vesicles in P. lanceolata. AMF and Collembola both enhanced   the amount of N and P in plant shoot tissue, but impacts of Collembola   were less pronounced in the presence of AMF. Overall, the results   suggest that, by differentially affecting the nutrient acquisition and   performance of plant species, AMF and Collembola interactively modify   plant competition and shape the composition of grassland plant   communities. The results suggest that mechanisms shaping plant community   composition can only be understood when complex belowground interactions   are considered.",1364,YES,SL,no,no data on PP,

Samples were collected from 7   BBD-infected S. siderea colonies on 2 reefs near Lee Stocking Island,   Bahamas, one reef in the Florida Keys, Florida, USA, and 2 reefs in St.   Croix, US Virgin Islands. Genomic DNA extracted from BBD samples was   PCR-amplified with universal bacterial primers (27F and 1492R). Seven   clone libraries were constructed and 411 sequences were retrieved. All   of the clone libraries were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and   contained sequences associated with bacteria of the sulfur cycle,   including the first report of the molecular detection of sequences   related to the sulfide-oxidizing genus Beggiatoa in BBD field samples.   Additionally, all clone libraries had sequence types of bacteria   associated with toxin producing dinoflagellates. These sequences were   most abundant in a sewage impacted reef site in St. Croix, which also   had the highest prevalence of BBD-infected colonies. Non-metric   multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis showed clustering of BBD   microbial communities by relative level of anthropogenic impact. The   results support the hypothesis that BBD is composed of variable members   of distinct physiological and toxin associated bacterial groups and that   the microbial community variation is associated with environmental   differences such as anthropogenic impact.

Classen",2017,Plant-mycorrhizal interactions mediate plant community coexistence by   altering resource demand,ECOLOGY,187-197,187-197,10.1002/ecy.1630,"As the diversity of plants increases in an ecosystem, so does resource   competition for soil nutrients, a process that mycorrhizal fungi can   mediate. The influence of mycorrhizal fungi on plant biodiversity likely   depends on the strength of the symbiosis between the plant and fungi,   the differential plant growth responses to mycorrhizal inoculation, and   the transfer rate of nutrients from the fungus to plant. However, our   current understanding of how nutrient-plant--mycorrhizal interactions   influence plant coexistence is conceptual and thus lacks a unified   quantitative framework. To quantify the conditions of plant coexistence   mediated by mycorrhizal fungi, we developed a mechanistic resource   competition model that explicitly included plant-mycorrhizal symbioses.   We found that plant-mycorrhizal interactions shape plant coexistence   patterns by creating a tradeoff in resource competition. Especially, a   tradeoff in resource competition was caused by differential payback in   the carbon resources that plants invested in the fungal symbiosis and/or   by the stoichiometric constraints on plants that required additional,   less-beneficial, resources to sustain growth. Our results suggested that   resource availability and the variation in plant-mycorrhizal   interactions act in concert to drive plant coexistence patterns.   Applying our framework, future empirical studies should investigate   plant-mycorrhizal interactions under multiple levels of resource   availability.",1366,NO,SL,,,

We determined changes in   intestinal commensal bacteria and expression of toll-like receptors   (TLR) 2 and 4 in rats bred under microbiologically controlled conditions   (barrier), under standard conditions (conventional), and in barrier   animals adapted to standard conditions (barrier/conventional). Cecal   microbiota was analyzed by plate culture, and fluorescence in situ   hybridization and microbial profiles were assessed by terminal   restriction fragment length polymorphism. Cecal expression of TLR-2 and   TLR-4 was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction   (PCR). Total number of cecal bacteria was similar in the three groups.   However, the barrier group showed a higher number of strict anaerobic   bacteria (Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp.) while Bifidobacterium   spp. were scarce. Re-housing the barrier-bred rats into conventional   conditions led to a microbiota with intermediate characteristics between   the barrier and conventional groups. Richness of the cecal microbial   ecosystem was similar in the three groups, although a relative   time-dependent variation, with highest homogeneity in the barrier group,   was observed. Expression levels of TLR-2 and TLR-4 had no clear   correlation with the microbiota. These results show that the relative   composition of the cecal microbiota in rats varies spontaneously with   changes in the environmental conditions, with minor impact in the   expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4.

Despite many local studies, a comprehensive   understanding of the key drivers of tick abundance at the continental   scale is still lacking. We analyze a large set of environmental factors   as potential drivers of I. ricinus abundance. Our multi-scale study was   carried out in deciduous forest fragments dispersed within two   contrasting rural landscapes of eight regions, along a macroclimatic   gradient stretching from southern France to central Sweden and Estonia.   We surveyed the abundance of I. ricinus, plant community composition,   forest structure and soil properties and compiled data on landscape   structure, macroclimate and habitat properties. We used linear mixed   models to analyze patterns and derived the relative importance of the   significant drivers.   Results: Many drivers had, on their own, either a moderate or small   explanatory value for the abundance of I. ricinus, but combined they   explained a substantial part of variation. This emphasizes the complex   ecology of I. ricinus and the relevance of environmental factors for   tick abundance. Macroclimate only explained a small fraction of   variation, while properties of macro- and microhabitat, which buffer   macroclimate, had a considerable impact on tick abundance. The amount of   forest and the composition of the surrounding rural landscape were   additionally important drivers of tick abundance. Functional   (dispersules) and structural (density of tree and shrub layers)   properties of the habitat patch played an important role. Various   diversity metrics had only a small relative importance. Ontogenetic tick   stages showed pronounced differences in their response. The abundance of   nymphs and adults is explained by the preceding stage with a positive   relationship, indicating a cumulative effect of drivers.   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the ecosystem disservices of   tick-borne diseases, via the abundance of ticks, strongly depends on   habitat properties and thus on how humans manage ecosystems from the   scale of the microhabitat to the landscape. This study stresses the need   to further evaluate the interaction between climate change and ecosystem   management on I. ricinus abundance.",1368,NO,SL,,,

Parasite assemblages may   also provide powerful models to study general principles of ecological   energetics. Yet there has been little ecological research on   parasite-host energetics, probably due to methodological difficulties.   However, the scaling relationships of individual metabolic rate with   body or cell size and temperature may permit us to tackle the energetics   of parasite assemblages in hosts. This article offers the foundations   and initial testing of a metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) framework for   parasites in hosts. I first provide equations to estimate energetic flux   through observed parasite assemblages. I then develop metabolic scaling   theory for parasite abundance, energetics, and biomass in individual   hosts. In contrast to previous efforts, the theory factors in both host   and parasite metabolic scaling, how parasites use host space, and   whether energy or space dictates carrying capacity. Empirical tests   indicate that host energetic flux can set parasite carrying capacity,   which decreases as predicted considering the scaling of host and   parasite metabolic rates. The theory and results also highlight that the   phenomenon of ``energetic equivalence'' is not an assumption of MTE   but a possible outcome contingent on how species partition resources.   Hence, applying MTE to parasites can lend mechanistic, quantitative,   predictive insight into the nature of parasitism and can inform general   ecological theory.",1369,NO,SL,,,

Warming   may, for instance, disrupt plant herbivore synchrony and bird phenology   in terrestrial systems, reduce primary production in oceans, and promote   toxic cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes. Responses of   communities will not only depend on direct species-specific temperature   effects, but also on indirect effects related to bottom-up and top-down   processes. Here, we investigated the impact of warming on freshwater   phytoplankton community dynamics, and assessed the relative contribution   of nutrient availability, fungal parasitism, and grazing therein. For   this purpose, we performed an indoor mesocosm experiment following   seasonal temperature dynamics of temperate lakes and a warmed (+ 4   degrees C) scenario from early spring to late summer. We assessed   phytoplankton biomass, C:N:P stoichiometry and community composition,   dissolved nutrient availabilities, fungal parasite (i.e., chytrid)   prevalence, and zooplankton abundance. Warming led to an overall   reduction in phytoplankton biomass as well as lower C: P and N: P   ratios, while phytoplankton community composition remained largely   unaltered. Warming resulted in an earlier termination of the diatom   spring bloom, and an epidemic of its fungal parasite ended earlier as   well. Furthermore, warming advanced zooplankton phenology, leading to an   earlier top-down control on phytoplankton in the period after the spring   bloom. Linear model analysis showed that most of the observed variance   in phytoplankton biomass was related to seasonal temperature dynamics in   combination with zooplankton abundance. Our findings showed that warming   advanced grazer phenology and reduced phytoplankton biomass, thereby   demonstrating how bottom-up and top-down related processes may shape   future phytoplankton dynamics.",1371,MAYBE,SL,yes,,

Macroparasites may be a major factor shaping animal behaviour. Tundra   ecosystems inhabited by caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are   known for large concentrations of ectoparasites including mosquitoes   (Culicidae) and black flies (Simuliidae), as well as endoparasitic   oestrid flies (Oestridae).   2. Increased intensity and duration of insect harassment because of   climatic warming is hypothesized as a potential factor in recent   declines of Rangifer across the circumpolar north. Although there is a   well-observed relationship between insect harassment and caribou /   reindeer behaviour, the influence of ecto-relative to endoparasitic   species is unclear. Climatic changes may favour the activity patterns,   distribution or abundance of certain insect species; thus, understanding   differential effects on the behaviour of Rangifer is important.   3. We recorded caribou behaviour using group scan and focal sampling   methods, while simultaneously trapping insects and recording weather   conditions on the postcalving / summer range of the Bathurst   barren-ground caribou herd in Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada,   during 2007-2009.   4. We developed statistical model sets representing hypotheses about the   effects of insects, weather, habitat / location, and date / time on   caribou behaviour. We used multinomial logistic regression models to   explore factors affecting the relative dominance of behaviour types   within groups of caribou and fractional multinomial logistic regression   models to determine factors influencing time allocation by individual   caribou. We examined changes in feeding intensity using fractional   logistic regression.   5. Relative dominance of insect avoidance behaviour within caribou   groups and time allocation to insect avoidance by individual caribou   increased when oestrid flies were present or black flies were active at   moderate-high levels. Mosquito activity had relatively little effect on   caribou behaviour. Time spent feeding was reduced by the greatest degree   when all three insect types were present in combination. Feeding   intensity was influenced to a greater extent by the accumulation of   growing degree days over the course of the postcalving / summer season   than by insect activity. Changes in Arctic systems that increase the   activity / abundance of ecto-and endoparasites could have implications   for the productivity of Rangifer populations.",1372,NO,SL,,,

Thus, those cereals species and varieties   with more root production had higher total mycorrhizal root biomass, and   those may potentially benefit more from AM. It is also concluded that   during early growth stages cereals invest first into root development   and then into AM fungal biomass.",1373,NO,SL,,,

However, a   growing human population and a global economy have spawned a 40-fold   increase in global trade and transportation since 1950. This created   what may turn out to be the most significant challenge to Park Service   management: the invasion of alien (i.e. exotic, non-native) plants,   animals and diseases into `protected areas'. Climate change may compound   the problem by interacting with other existing ecosystem stressors to   affect the distribution, abundance and impact of invasive species.   Scientists' warnings have not been entirely ignored, but harmful   invasions may be outpacing effective managerial responses. This chapter   revisits a paper published in 1995 by D.B. Houston and E.G. Schreiner   entitled `Alien Species in National Parks: Drawing Lines in Space and   Time', to demonstrate that despite efforts to contain alien plants,   animals and diseases, the number and abundance of conspicuous invaders   may be increasing. New and spreading alien species are directly   affecting native species abundance, their genetic integrity and the   management of adjacent lands, and human health. While climate change may   add an additional or interacting threat to park resources, we found that   at park scales and over short periods (17 years in this case), it has   become increasingly difficult to achieve the primary mission of the   National Park Service, for example protecting native species and   ecosystems for present and future generations, due to the continuing   invasions of alien organisms largely resulting from increased trade and   transportation.",1374,NO,SL,,,

These experiments are   the first to examine directly the impact of honey bee, Apis mellifera,   nest invaders on plant pollination and fitness. A cost to pollination   could occur under two scenarios: (1) at the colony level where nest   invaders compromise the health of the foraging cohort and reduce their   efficacy as pollinators or (2) at the community level where invaders   simply kill bee colonies and reduce the local pollinator population.   Honey bee colonies were manipulated to achieve different levels of the   parasitic mite Varroa destructor or nest-invading beetle Aethina tumida   and tented under one of two model plants: canola (Brassica napus) or   rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei). On the basis of single-bee flower   visits, fruit-set was reduced in blueberry with bees from   varroa-parasitized colonies. However, on the basis of colonies, there   were no differences in blueberry fruit-set, number of blueberry pollen   tetrads deposited on the stigma, and pod-set in canola among colonies   with different levels of nest invaders or no-invader controls. Thus,   within the range of nest invader densities used in this study,   individual inefficiencies were erased by compensatory multiple flower   visits by this colonial pollinator. By failing to affirm the   functionality of scenario (1) this study indirectly supports scenario   (2): the major contribution of honey bee nest invaders toward a   pollinator deficit is the simple eradication of colonies.

To measure species richness   and abundance, we used wildlife cameras for meso-and-large vertebrates,   mark-and-recapture analyses for small mammals, mark-and-resight analysis   for reptiles, and standard dragging techniques for tick collections   because they are frequent ectoparasites on vertebrates in oak woodland   habitats. Our results show that meso-and-large vertebrate richness and   abundance increase with patch area as does tick density.

However, many mutualisms are still invaded by parasites, and we propose   that plant `tolerance strategies', which allow an individual to re-grow   and/or reproduce after damage, might have evolved to recover some of the   fitness lost to parasitism. We focus on the ant plant Cordia nodosa and   its protecting ant symbionts Allomerus octoarticulatus and Azteca spp.   Allomerus is a castration parasite, destroying host flowers. However,   some flowers are produced on new branch shoots, where they escape   castration. Here, we ask whether C. nodosa tolerates castration by   directing floral growth to new shoots. We find that C. nodosa produces   four times more floral buds on the new shoots of Allomerus-inhabited   plants, compared to Azteca-inhabited plants. Additionally, on   Allomerus-inhabited plants, the production of floral buds is three times   greater on new than on mature shoots, and more floral buds are grown on   plants with new shoots than on those without. We conclude therefore that   C. nodosa tolerates castration by re-allocating floral resources to new   shoots. We also test whether tolerance exploits behavioural differences   between the brood-tending `nurse' ant worker caste, which is active on   mature shoots, and the new shoot-protecting `patroller' caste.   Behavioural assay experiments reveal that nurse ants are strongly   attracted to extracts of flowers, whereas patrollers are not, suggesting   that nurses are the primary castrating caste. Thus, producing flowers on   new shoots avoids the castrating caste. We finish by proposing that   tolerance strategies can promote the evolution and maintenance of   mutualism.",1377,NO,SL,,,

Larvae of D. pastinacella feed on H..sphondylium   seeds and, after they have finished feeding, chew holes in the hollow   stems where they pupate. In some areas of the country almost 50\% of   plants are attacked by webworms. The holes are used by other arthropods   to gain access to the stems including herbivores, omnivores, predators   and decomposers. The duration of plant occupancy varies between 3 and 4   months, until the plants die. Plants without moth-produced holes were   always free of other arthropods, whereas plants with holes, in addition   to pupae (and/or mummified-parasitized webworm larvae), often contained   many woodlice, earwigs and/or spiders.

In this study, we used a combination of statistical genetics,   experimental evolution and common garden experiments to investigate the   evolutionary potential for thermal adaptation in the potato late blight   pathogen, Phytuphthara infestans, and infer its likely response to   changing temperatures. We found a trade-off associated with thermal   adaptation to heterogeneous environments in P. infestans, with the   degree of the trade-off peaking approximately at the pathogen's optimum   growth temperature. A genetic trade-off in thermal adaptation was also   evidenced by the negative association between a strain's growth rate and   its thermal range for growth, and warm climates selecting for a low   pathogen growth rate. We also found a mirror effect of phenotypic   plasticity and genetic adaptation on growth rate. At below the optimum,   phenotypic plasticity enhances pathogen's growth rate but nature selects   for slower growing genotypes when temperature increases. At above the   optimum, phenotypic plasticity reduces pathogen's growth rate but   natural selection favours for faster growing genotypes when temperature   increases further.

We found that DHAB   sediments are hot-spots of viral infections, which largely contribute to   the release of high amounts of extracellular DNA. DNase activities in   DHAB sediments were much higher than other extracellular enzymatic   activities, suggesting that extracellular DNA released from killed   prokaryotes can be the most suitable trophic resource for benthic   prokaryotes. Preserved extracellular DNA pools, which contained novel   and diversified gene sequences, were very similar between the DHABs but   dissimilar from the respective microbial DNA pools.

We studied the elemental relationship   (carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus) of P. anserina in comparison with native   emergent macrophytes (Eleocharis pachicarpa and Carex aematorrhyncha).   These plant species are common and dominant in the wetland.   Additionally, we analyzed the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the roots   and their proportion of root infection.

Recommendations to resettle   communities should ideally be supported with careful evaluation of the   needs of wildlife, socio-economic characteristics of dependent   communities and their attitudes, and we present one such case study.   Using a semi-structured questionnaire survey of 158 households across a   gradient of tiger occupancy, we found overwhelming preference for   resettlement among pastoralist Gujjars and hence an unexpected   conservation opportunity to expand inviolate areas for tigers in the   western Terai Arc Landscape. The main `push factors' identified were   declining forest productivity adversely affecting incomes and lack of   access to education and health facilities. Thus, our findings represent   a rare instance where excessive extraction of natural resources,   recognized to be detrimental for biodiversity, is also the primary   driver for resettlement. The desire for resettlement was also   re-enforced by losses of livestock to diseases (72.7\%) and carnivores   (25.1\%), which was uncompensated in 89\% of the cases, and positive   experiences from previously resettled households. Demand for   resettlement was uniformly strong regardless of local tiger occupancy,   but we suggest that funding for resettlement be prioritized for   households in high tiger occupancy areas, given higher livestock   depredation and possibilities for conflict. Our findings, therefore,   represent a novel landscape-level conservation strategy that takes   account of socio-economic circumstances across a gradient of predator   pressure, and could build a constituency for tiger conservation among   local communities consistent with national and global objectives.

To date, however, the effects of parasitic infection on the   sensitivity of marine organisms to OA have been largely ignored.

However, very little is known about the effects of   peccaries or their loss on litter amphibians and reptiles. We   experimentally reduced peccary density in 20 x 50 m fenced exclusion   plots (n = 5). We compared standing litter structure and amphibian and   reptile abundance where peccaries were excluded to paired, open-forest   control plots that had natural peccary densities. We encountered 16\%   more amphibian and reptile individuals in open control plots, and we   encountered more juveniles of the most common anuran species in control   plots than on peccary exclusions. Control plots had more compacted   litter than peccary exclusion plots, indicating that peccaries alter the   physical structure of the standing leaf litter in a way that promotes   greater recruitment of juvenile anurans. Our results demonstrate that   peccaries should be viewed not just as seed predators or ecosystem   engineers for palms and pond-breeding amphibians, but also as important   agents that affect leaf litter structure and abundance of terrestrial   amphibians and reptiles.

The study   took place in a eucalypt-dominated temperate grassy woodland. Annual   assessments show that juvenile woody plant recruitment occurred over the   first 3 years of CO2 fumigation, though eCO(2) did not affect rates of   recruitment. Manipulative experiments were established to examine the   effect of eCO(2) on above-ground seedling growth using transplanted   Eucalyptus tereticornis (Myrtaceae) and Hakea sericea (Proteaceae)   seedlings.

The presence of herbaceous competitors and   defoliation by invertebrates and pathogens were found to greatly reduce   growth and/or resprouting response of seedlings.

Most coleopteran and   hymenopteran functional groups were consistently more abundant in the   thinned stand than in the unthinned stand.

We evaluated spatial variation in elk   density, group sizes, and adult female brucellosis seroprevalence in 39   elk management districts in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem using a   Bayesian approach. We used modeled relationships to estimate the effects   of reducing elk density by 10-90\% on grouping patterns and   seroprevalence rates.

We estimated   seroprevalence rates of 0.01-0.27 across management districts, and   seroprevalence increased as elk density increased. For the 7 of 39   management districts with >10\% estimated seroprevalence, 10\%, 50\%,   and 90\% reductions in elk density resulted in predicted mean   seroprevalence reductions of 2\%, 7\%, and 9\%, respectively.

The present study is focused on the synthesis of alpha-chitin   nanoparticles (CNP) from the shells of Penaeus monodon Fabricius, silver   nanoparticles (AgNP) and alpha-chitin/silver nanocomposite (CNP/AgNP),   and to evaluate their antimicrobial and mosquito larvicidal activities.   The antibacterial and antifungal activities are assessed against five   different bacterial and fungal strains. Also the mosquito larvicidal   potential is studied against Aedes aegypti a potential vector for   malaria and dengue fever. The synthesized nanocomposites are   characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier   transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope,   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope   and dynamic light scattering analysis. The antibacterial and antifungal   assays reveal that the CNP/AgNP has an enhanced antimicrobial effect on   inhibition of bacteria (P. vulgaris, K. pneumonia and S. aureus) as well   as fungi (C. albicans, T. viridae, A. niger and A. alternate). Mosquito   larvicidal assays confirm that CNP/AgNP has shown lowest LC50 and LC90   values than CNP and AgNP against all the instars of A. aegypti. Hence   our result suggests that the incorporation of AgNP with CNP could   improve the antimicrobial and mosquito larvicidal activity and have the   potential to be used as biocompatible antimicrobial and mosquito   larvicidal material.",1391,NO,SL,,,

The granulated biosolids were surface   applied to the turf at a total N loading of 240 kg N ha(-1), equivalent   to the current turf farm practice of applying 18.9 m(3) ha(-1) of   poultry litter. One week after the application of the organic fertiliser   treatments, simulated rainfall was applied to each plot at an intensity   of 90 mm h(-1) for a period of 0.5 h, and all runoff water was collected   and analysed for a range of important water quality parameters. The most   significant result from this study was the finding that runoff water   samples from the poultry litter treatment plots were found to contain 10   times more total P (12.3 mg l(-1) compared to 1.2 mg l(-1)) and   dissolved P (8.3 mg l(-1) compared to 0.6 mg l(-1)) than that found in   the runoff water samples from the biosolid treatment. The relationship   between application total P loading (TPA) and runoff water total P   concentration (RO-P) was significantly (P < 0.05) different between the   biosolids (RO-P:TPA ratio = 0.01) and poultry litter (RO-P:TPA ratio =   0.16) products, reflecting the importance of the chemical nature of the   applied P in addition to the total loading. The phosphorus in the   poultry litter was much more easily mobilised and transported in runoff   than the biosolids P. For surface applications of these organic wastes,   bicarbonate extractable P loading provided a better indication of runoff   P contamination risk in the first flush of runoff, than total P loading.   The runoff from the biosolid treatment plots also had lower levels of   NH(4)-N and salinity than the poultry litter plots, although both   treatments had moderate levels of dissolved organic carbon in their   runoff. Heavy metal levels in the runoff were below guideline limits for   both organic amendments, while runoff pathogen levels were highly   variable. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of using   granulated biosolids as an alternative surface applied organic N   fertiliser on turf farms for its lower risk to surface water quality as   compared to poultry litter, the current practice.

By   comparing interactions between clones of bacteria and viruses both   within-and between-time points, we show that increasing nutrient   availability resulted in coevolution shifting from FSD, with   fluctuations in average infectivity and resistance ranges over time, to   ARD. Our model shows that range fluctuations with lower nutrient   availability can be explained both by elevated costs of resistance (a   direct effect of nutrient availability), and reduced benefits of   resistance when population sizes of hosts and parasites are lower (an   indirect effect). Nutrient availability can therefore predictably and   generally affect qualitative coevolutionary dynamics by both direct and   indirect (mediated through ecological feedbacks) effects on costs of   resistance.",1396,NO,SL,,,

The diversity of culturable fungi associated   with six species of healthy South China Sea gorgonians were investigated   using a culture-dependent method followed by analysis of fungal internal   transcribed spacer sequences. A total of 121 fungal isolates were   recovered and identified using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool   search program. These belonged to 41 fungal species from 20 genera. Of   these, 30 species and 12 genera are new reports for gorgonians, and the   genera Aspergillus and Penicillium were the most diverse and common in   the six gorgonian species. Comparison of the fungal communities in the   six gorgonian species, together with results from previous relevant   studies, indicated that different gorgonian species and the same   gorgonian species living in different geographic locations had different   fungal communities. The gorgonian Dichotella gemmacea harbored the most   fungal species and isolates, while Echinogorgia aurantiaca had the least   fungal diversity. Among the six media used for fungal isolation, potato   glucose agar yielded the highest isolates (27 isolates), while glucose   peptone starch agar had the best recoverability of fungal species (15   species). The antimicrobial activity of the 121 fungal isolates was   tested against three marine bacteria and two marine gorgonian pathogenic   fungi. A relatively high proportion (38 \%) of fungal isolates displayed   distinct antibacterial and antifungal activity, suggesting that the   gorgonian-associated fungi may aid their hosts in protection against   pathogens.

This   variability may arise through differences in physical habitats or   biological interactions between parasites and their hosts, and may occur   on very fine spatial scales. Using a pseudophyllidean cestode   (Schistocephalus solidus) and the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus   aculeatus) as a model parasite-host complex, we investigated the   association of infection with host diet composition and stomach fullness   in different habitats of two large lakes in southwest Alaska. To become   infected, the fish must consume pelagic copepods infected with the   parasite's procercoid stage, so we predicted higher infection rates of   fish in offshore habitats (where zooplankton are the primary prey)   compared to fish from the littoral zone. Sticklebacks collected from the   littoral and limnetic zones were assayed for parasites and their stomach   contents were classified, counted, and weighed. Contrary to our   prediction, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and   principal components analysis revealed that threespine sticklebacks in   the littoral zone, which consumed a generalist diet (pelagic zooplankton   and benthic invertebrates), had higher parasite prevalence and biomass   intensity than conspecifics in the limnetic zone, which consumed   zooplankton. These results, consistent in two different lakes, suggest   that differences in parasite prevalence between habitats may have been   determined by a shift in host habitat due to infection, differential   host mortality across habitats, differential procercoid prevalence in   copepods across habitats, or a combination of the three factors. This   paradoxical result highlights the potential for fine spatial variability   in parasite abundance in natural systems.",1398,NO,SL,,,

We found that the   productivity of the system and the strength of the plant-fungal   mutualism influenced community dynamics. In particular, at low   productivity, the pathogen may depend on the presence of the fungal   mutualist for persistence. Furthermore, under some conditions, both the   productivity of the system and the strength of the plant-fungal   mutualism may simultaneously cause the mutualist to go extinct. We note   the presence of cyclic plant-pathogen population dynamics only in the   presence of the mutualist. As found in other models of consumer-resource   interactions, cyclic dynamics were driven by high productivity, but, in   contrast to simpler systems, high pathogen effectiveness did not   consistently lead to cyclic dynamics.

In this interaction ants may   alter the abundance, diversity and community structure of predators and   parasitoids. In the present study, we conducted ant-exclusion   experiments in three commercial citrus orchards, each one dominated by   one ant species (Pheidole pallidula, Lasius grandis or Linepithema   humile) during two consecutive years. We then compared the abundance,   species richness, diversity and community structure of predators and   parasitoids between the ant-allowed and ant-excluded treatments. A total   of 176,074 natural enemies belonging to 81 taxa were captured and   identified. The abundance of the natural enemies showed a species   specific response between treatments. When examining functional groups   of natural enemies the abundance of generalist predators decreased while   that of parasitoids increased in the ant-allowed treatment. The species   richness was significantly lower for predators and higher for   parasitoids in the ant-allowed treatment. The Shannon diversity index   was not different between treatments for predators, whereas parasitoid   diversity was significantly higher in the ant-allowed treatment.   Finally, the community structure of predators and parasitoids was not   significantly different between treatments. These results suggest that   ants in citrus are not associated with a dramatic decrease in natural   enemy abundance or biodiversity; on the contrary ants were associated   with increased parasitoid species richness and diversity. On the other   hand, ants negatively affected the abundance of specific natural enemy   species, mainly generalist predators.

The   latter in turn form ectomycorrhizas with trees, the ultimate C source of   the entire system. A similar nutritional strategy occurs in some green   forest orchids, phylogenetically close to MH species, that gain their C   via a combination of MH and photosynthesis (mixotrophy). In orchid   evolution, mixotrophy evolved in shaded habitats and preceded MH   nutrition. By generalizing and applying this to Ericaceae, we   hypothesized that green forest species phylogenetically close to MHs are   mixotrophic. Using stable C isotope analysis with fungi, autotrophic,   mixotrophic and MH plants as comparisons, we found the first   quantitative evidence for substantial fungi-mediated mixotrophy in the   Pyroleae, common ericaceous shrubs from boreal forests close to the MH   Monotropoideae. Orthilia secunda, Pyrola chlorantha, Pyrola rotundifolia   and Chimaphila umbellata acquired between 10.3 and 67.5\% of their C   from fungi. High N and N-15 contents also suggest that Pyroleae   nutrition partly rely on fungi. Examination of root fungal internal   transcribed spacer sequences at one site revealed that 39 species of   mostly endophytic or ectomycorrhizal fungi, including abundant   Tricholoma spp., were associated with O. secunda, P. chlorantha and C.   umbellata. These fungi, particularly ectomycorrhizal associates, could   thus link mixotrophic Pyroleae spp. to surrounding trees, allowing the C   flows deduced from isotopic evidence.

Phylogenetic history   might partly explain the impact of fragmentation and land-use change on   assemblages of interacting organisms and even determine potential   cascading effects across trophic levels. However, it remains unclear   whether phylogenetic diversity of basal resources is reflected at higher   trophic levels in the food web. In particular, phylogenetic determinants   of community structure have never been incorporated into habitat edge   studies, even though edges are recognized as key factors affecting   communities in fragmented landscapes. Here, we test whether phylogenetic   diversity at different trophic levels (plants, herbivores and   parasitoids) and signals of co-evolution (i.e. phylogenetic congruence)   among interacting trophic levels change across an edge gradient between   native and plantation forests. To ascertain whether there is a signal of   co-evolution across trophic levels, we test whether related consumer   species generally feed on related resource species. We found differences   across trophic levels in how their phylogenetic diversity responded to   the habitat edge gradient. Plant and native parasitoid phylogenetic   diversity changed markedly across habitats, while phylogenetic   variability of herbivores (which were predominantly native) did not   change across habitats, though phylogenetic evenness declined in   plantation interiors. Related herbivore species did not appear to feed   disproportionately on related plant species (i.e. there was no signal of   co-evolution) even when considering only native species, potentially due   to the high trophic generality of herbivores. However, related native   parasitoid species tended to feed on related herbivore species,   suggesting the presence of a co-evolutionary signal at higher trophic   levels. Moreover, this signal was stronger in plantation forests,   indicating that this habitat may impose stresses on parasitoids that   constrain them to attack only host species for which they are best   adapted. Overall, changes in land use across native to plantation forest   edges differentially affected phylogenetic diversity across trophic   levels, and may also exert a strong selective pressure for particular   co-evolved herbivore-parasitoid interactions.",1404,NO,SL,,,

Bimonthly surface sampling (July 2009 to   December 2011) was conducted at four locations within Mobile Bay (Bay)   and along the Alabama continental shelf (Shelf). Alpha-diversity only   showed significant differences in Shelf sites, with the greatest   differences observed between summer and winter. Beta-diversity showed   significant differences in community composition in relation to season   and the Bay was dominated by diatoms, while the Shelf was characterized   by dinoflagellates and copepods. The northern Gulf of Mexico is heavily   influenced by the Mobile River Basin, which brings low-salinity   nutrient-rich water mostly during winter and spring. Community   composition was correlated with salinity, temperature and dissolved   silicate. However, species interactions (e.g. predation and parasitism)   may also contribute to the observed variation, especially on the Shelf,   which warrants further exploration. Metabarcoding revealed clear   patterns in surface pelagic micro-eukaryote communities that were   consistent over multiple years, demonstrating how these techniques could   be greatly beneficial to ecological monitoring and management over   temporal scales.",1408,NO,SL,,,

We conducted a trap-box experiment in a recently   abandoned quarry at 10 different distances from the quarry edge (i.e.   the potential propagule source) over eleven months to assess the short   term, within-year, arrival of plant and AM fungal assemblages and hence   their dispersal abilities.

However, the spatial   extent of habitats, a key metric of ecosystem structure, has not been   mapped in these studies. Marine reserves can provide experimental,   before-after and inside-outside (control-impacted), situations for   assessing the impact of fishing on ecosystems. We mapped seabed habitats   and their associated communities (biotopes) in New Zealand's oldest   marine reserve for comparison with pre-reserve maps created about 30   years previously.   Areas grazed bare by sea urchins were entirely replaced in the centre of   the reserve by kelp, or alga turf, an intermediate biotope between   heavily grazed encrusting algae and lightly grazed kelp. Urchins   declined following increased abundance and body size of spiny (rock)   lobsters and fish (especially snapper) in the reserve but maintained   bare rock outside. While this gradient in habitat change matched the   gradient of predator abundance, it also matched the extent of reef   habitat area. Thus the trophic cascade may be influenced by the effect   of habitat on the abundance and behavioural interactions of urchins and   their predators. Further ecosystem changes may arise should the   abundance of mega-predators, such as seals, cetaceans and large sharks,   increase in the region; if parasites become pathogenic; and/or when   invasive species reach the reserve.   No-take marine reserves provide real-world experiments that show the   importance of species in food webs, and the consequences of fishing for   ecosystems. Because these changes in ecosystem structure may continue,   and will vary with environment, climate and species distributions,   reserves need to be permanent and replicated geographically. Habitat   maps should be produced for all reserves to enable ecological changes in   the ecosystem to be spatially quantified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All   rights reserved.",1410,NO,SL,,,

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of   Stachys palustris (Marsh Woundwort) that are relevant to understanding   its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are   presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the   British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic   factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology,   floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and   conservation.   2. Stachys palustris is a monoecious perennial herb, with long creeping,   strong, subsurface rhizomes. It is a common native herb growing by   streams, rivers, ditches, ponds, in fens, marshes and swamps, and less   frequently a weed of cultivated land.   3. Although widespread throughout most of the British Isles, S.   palustris is typically a plant of land water transitional situations   that are not seral and, as such, appears to be under-represented in   descriptions of plant communities.   4. Stachys palustris is typically found on intermittently flooded and   poorly drained soils, which are weakly acid or weakly basic and highly   fertile.   5. The production of numerous subsurface rhizomes by S. palustris helps   to maintain shoot population density with little recourse to seedling   recruitment.   6. Stachys x ambigua, the hybrid between Stachys palustris and S.   sylvatica, is most frequent in northern and western Britain.   7. Stachys palustris is particularly valuable as a nectar source for   insects, especially bumblebees. It has antispasmodic, antiseptic and   astringent properties; the name `Woundwort' derives from its traditional   use in staunching bleeding and healing wounds.",1413,NO,SL,,,

The BW was   collected from two vacuum toilets (VTs) (0.8 L flush water) and   separated in peat filters (PFs) to obtain a liquid fraction (LF) and a   solid fraction (SF) of the BW. The LF from the PFs was thereafter   treated in a biofilter (BF) and finally evaporated in the evaporation   module (EM) powered by solar vacuum collectors (SVC). In the PFs,   particles larger than 1 mm were reduced from the BW by 96.5\%.   Furthermore, the total suspended solids (TSS) mass removal efficiency of   the PFs averaged 51.5\%. Reduction of ammonia through nitrification was   noticeably enhanced after 100 days of the system operation (max.   55.8\%). 21.2\% or 0.54 kg of total phosphorus (TP) was retained in the   PFs, to be further composted and reused for agricultural purposes. An   additional 5\% or 0.10 kg of TP was retained in the BF.

However, we did not find evidence   that overyielding was related to either resource depletion or to   pathogenic soil fungi, two causes of overyielding in species-diverse   communities. Instead, larger accessions overyielded at low diversity at   the expense of smaller accessions, and small accessions overyielded   through complementarity at all levels of diversity. Furthermore,   overyielding was stronger for accessions from mesic environments,   suggesting that local adaptation might predictably influence how plants   respond to increases in diversity. This suggests that mass-based   competition or other cryptic accession-specific processes had complex   but important effects on overyielding.

The woody   plant community was assessed in three strata (upper, mid- and lower) and   was used to characterize forest composition and structure.

In   forest simulations lacking pathogen invasion, little change in   composition or structure is forecasted. Both red oaks and white oaks   (subgenus Leucobalanus) increase slightly but significantly over the   length of the simulation.

Basal area of white oaks and non-oaks is expected to   increase more so in the absence of red oaks. The loss of red oaks to   pathogen infection will result in greater increases in red maple, Acer   rubrum, and yellow poplar, Liriodendron tulipifera, than in forests free   of SOD. Loss of red oak represents a significant loss of hard mast, with   potentially devastating consequences for wildlife.

Rauch et   al. found consistently lower parasite loads in genetically-mixed   infections compared to uniform infections. Using the additive partition   of Loreau and Hector they demonstrated that this lower parasite load was   due to negative complementarity effects, but they only found weak   selection effects. Complementarity effects arise from differentiation   among genotypes that accrue equally to all genotypes, while selection   effects arise from unexpectedly high performance of certain genotypes in   mixed infections. However, selection effects might arise either because   genotypes with certain traits perform unexpectedly well in mixed   infections at the expense of other genotypes ('dominance effects', DEs),   or because genotypes with certain traits perform unexpectedly well, but   not at the expense of others genotypes ('trait dependent complementarity   effects', TDCEs). Here, we reanalyze the data of Rauch et al. using the   tripartite partition of Fox to separate DEs, TDCEs and trait-independent   complementarity effects (TICEs, corresponding to the complementarity   effect of Loreau and Hector). We found significantly negative TDCEs that   contribute strongly to the low parasite loads in mixed infections. We   suggest novel, testable hypotheses to explain negative TDCEs.

Using a   quantitative food web approach we evaluated the impacts of an invasive   plant on plant-herbivore-parasitoid communities, asking specifically how   diet breadth influences the propagation of such impacts. Measuring the   impact of the alien plant at the plant level seriously underestimated   the community-level effect of this weed as it also caused changes in the   abundance of native herbivores and parasitoids, along with a decrease in   parasitoid species richness. The invading plant affected specialist and   generalist subsets of communities differently, having significant and   strong negative impacts on the abundance of all specialists with no   negative effect on generalist consumers. Specialist consumer decline led   to further disruptions of top-down regulatory mechanisms, releasing   generalist species from competition via shared natural enemies. Plant   invasion also significantly increased the evenness of species abundance   of all trophic levels in the food webs, as well as the evenness of   species interaction frequency. Extending impact evaluation to higher   trophic levels and considering changes in trophic diversity within   levels is hence essential for a full evaluation of the consequences of   invasion by alien plants.

This study at hand suggests a new   spectroscopic method for high-throughput characterization of pollen.   2. Samples were measured as thin films of pollen fragments using a   Bruker FTIR spectrometer with a high-throughput eXTension (HTS-XT) unit   employing 384-well plates. In total, 146 pollen samples, belonging to 31   different pollen species of Fagaceae and Betulaceae and collected during   three consecutive years (2012-2014) at locations in Croatia, Germany and   Norway, were analysed. Critical steps in the sample preparation and   measurement, such as variabilities between technical replicates, between   microplates and between spectrometers, were studied.   3. Measurement variations due to sample preparation, microplate holders   and instrumentation were low, and thus allowed differentiation of   samples with respect to phylogeny and biogeography. The spectral   variability for a range of Fagales species (Fagus, Quercus, Betula,   Corylus, Alnus and Ostrya) showed high-species-specific differences in   pollen's chemical composition due to either location or year.   Statistically significant inter-annual and locational differences in the   pollen spectra indicate that pollen chemical composition has high   phenotypic plasticity and is influenced by local climate conditions. The   variations in composition are connected to lipids, proteins,   carbohydrates and sporopollenins that play crucial roles in cold and   desiccation tolerance, protection against UV radiation and as material   and energy reserves.   4.

Consistent with previous work on vector-borne   pathogens, we found that large wildlife removal causes strong and   systematic increases of rodent-borne parasites, largely due to increases   in rodent density, as rodents are released from competition with larger   herbivores. Although we predicted that increased host density would also   increase per capita infection among all directly transmitted parasites,   this additional amplification occurred for only two of three examined   parasites. Furthermore, the actual effects of large mammal loss on per   capita infection were mediated by the complex suite of abiotic and   biotic factors that regulate parasite transmission. Thus, while these   results strongly suggest that large wildlife loss will cause systematic   increases in rodent parasite populations, they also underscore the   difficulty of making more specific predictions for a given parasite   based on simple attributes such as transmission mode or life history   strategy. Instead, detailed information on the ecology of each parasite   species would be necessary to make more accurate predictions of how   biodiversity loss will affect infection.",1424,MAYBE,SL,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

New genetic methods make it possible to   identify the number of feral colonies with which a test queen mates. We   present an agent-based model of the spatial process of honey bee mating   that describes the relationship between feral colony densities and the   number of unique colonies with which a queen mates. This model   incorporates random, aggregated and overdispersed spatial distributions   of feral colonies and drone congregation areas. We model different   densities of feral colonies and drone congregation areas with various   numbers of test queens and determine the range of counts of matings with   drones from unique colonies. The model shows that the range of counts   for a given set of parameters is consistent with a Poisson distribution,   and that the most significant explanatory variable is density of the   feral colonies. The results obtained reveal that 10 or more test queens   may be needed in field studies to resolve order of magnitude differences   in feral colony densities. We conclude that the new genetic methods   provide a powerful tool for making indirect inferences about feral   colony densities, so long as the field survey results are treated as   outcomes of a stochastic spatial process.

While there is mounting   evidence that especially neonicotinoid seed dressings detrimentally   affect insect pollinators, surprisingly little is known on potential   side effects on soil biota. We hypothesized that soil organisms would be   particularly susceptible to pesticide seed dressings as they get in   direct contact with these chemicals. Using microcosms with field soil we   investigated, whether seeds treated either with neonicotinoid   insecticides or fungicides influence the activity and interaction of   earthworms, collembola, protozoa and microorganisms. The full-factorial   design consisted of the factor Seed dressing (control vs. insecticide   vs. fungicide), Earthworm (no earthworms vs. addition Lumbricus   terrestris L.) and collembola (no collembola vs. addition Sinella   curviseta Brook). We used commercially available wheat seed material   (Triticum aesticum L. cf. Lukullus) at a recommended seeding density of   367 m(-2).   Results: Seed dressings (particularly fungicides) increased collembola   surface activity, increased the number of protozoa and reduced plant   decomposition rate but did not affect earthworm activity. Seed dressings   had no influence on wheat growth. Earthworms interactively affected the   influence of seed dressings on collembola activity, whereas collembola   increased earthworm surface activity but reduced soil basal respiration.   Earthworms also decreased wheat growth, reduced soil basal respiration   and microbial biomass but increased soil water content and electrical   conductivity.   Conclusions: The reported non-target effects of seed dressings and their   interactions with soil organisms are remarkable because they were   observed after a one-time application of only 18 pesticide treated seeds   per experimental pot. Because of the increasing use of seed dressing in   agriculture and the fundamental role of soil organisms in   agro-ecosystems these ecological interactions should receive more   attention.",1427,NO,SL,,,

We use published data on rates at which trematodes   produce free-swimming infective larvae (cercariae) that are released   from their gastropod intermediate hosts to investigate patterns in   cercarial output as a function of different variables, and to calculate   the annual production of cercariae in different marine benthic systems.   Across 18 trematode species, cercarial output (no. cercariae shed   snail(-1) d(-1)) ranged over 4 orders of magnitude and was positively   correlated with snail host species size. While cercarial output did not   correlate with latitude, it did correlate negatively with the size of   cercariae, and was influenced by the type of downstream host sought by   cercariae, being highest when this host was a vertebrate. Our estimates   of annual cercarial production (kJ m(-2) yr(-1)), which take into   account the density of infected snails in the habitat, were within the   range of production values reported for free-living invertebrates   inhabiting benthic ecosystems.

After five growing seasons, VFG resulted in the highest soil   organic C (1.46\% SOC) and total N contents (0.117\%TN). SOC and TN   contents of the MIN N plots, on the other hand, remained unchanged and   were even similar to those of NF+ plots, despite greater biomass   production on the MIN N plots than on the NF+ plots. Application of   organic matter mostly increased dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase and   beta-glucosaminidase activity, but only FYM raised the activity of all   three enzymes significantly compared to MIN N. Of the five organic   amendments tested, only VFG suppressed Rhizoctonia solani (65\%   suppressiveness). Plots treated with FCP1, on the other hand, were   highly conducive to R. solani (28.3\% suppressiveness). Suppressiveness   against R. solani probably depended on the maturity and cellulose   content of the organic amendments. Highest microbial biomass C contents   were found in the VFG plots. PLFA 16:1 omega 5c contents sensitively   reacted to the different treatments and were significantly higher in VFG   than in MIN N plots (3.84 and 2.20 nmol g(-1) dry soil, respectively).   Finally, a soil quality index was developed using stepwise canonical   discriminant analysis. beta-glucosaminidase and beta-glucosidase   activity, and TN content were the most important parameters of the   index. According to this index, FYM resulted in a significantly higher   soil quality than the other treatments.

Fungi play critical roles in ecosystem processes and interact with   plant communities in mutualistic, pathogenic, and commensal ways. Fungal   communities are thought to depend on both associated tree communities   and soil properties. However, the relative importance of the biotic and   abiotic drivers of soil fungal community structure and diversity in   lowland tropical forests remains poorly understood.   2. We examined the community structure of trees and fungi at different   levels of phosphorus (0.17-16.3 mg kg(-1)) in moist tropical forests in   Panama. We predicted that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal composition   would be more strongly associated with soil properties than with local   tree communities while the composition of other fungal clades would be   more strongly correlated with local tree communities than soil   properties. We also predicted that fungal operational taxonomic unit   (OTU) richness would be negatively correlated with soil fertility and   positively correlated with tree species diversity within and among   forests.   3. We characterized soil chemistry, fine root biomass, and sequenced the   ITS1 barcode region to describe fungal community composition from 70   soil cores across three 1-ha tropical rainforest sites in Panama. The   sites vary in soil chemistry, including P, and in tree species community   composition, but experience similar annual rainfall.   4. AM fungal community composition was partially correlated with soil   chemistry (r = 0.32, P = 0.001), but not with local tree communities,   while non-AM fungal communities were nearly equally correlated with soil   chemistry (Partial Mantel test, r = 0.38, P = 0.001) as with tree   communities (r = 0.36, P = 0.001). Linear models showed that AM OTU   richness was not explained by any independent variable. For non-AM   fungi, phosphorus, pH, and soil moisture better predicted OTU richness   across all cores than other biotic and abiotic factors.   5. Synthesis. Our results show that AM fungal structure is driven   primarily by soil chemistry. For non-AM fungi, soil properties and the   local tree community can play a joint role in structuring communities.   Furthermore, we found that more diverse local tree communities did not   harbour more fungal species.

Existing models produce power laws,   but their predicted exponents are too high and fail to capture the   exponent's variation with geographic region. Here we present a minimal   model of fire dynamics that describes fire spread as a stochastic   birth-death process, analogous to stochastic population growth or   disease spread and incorporating memory effects from previous fires. The   model reproduces multiple regional patterns in fire regimes and allows   us to classify different regions in terms of their proximity to a   critical threshold. Transitions across this critical threshold imply   abrupt and pronounced increases in average fire size. The model predicts   that large regions in Canada are currently close to this transition and   might be driven beyond the threshold in the future. We illustrate this   point by analyzing the time series for large fires (>199 ha) from the   Canadian Boreal Plains, found to have shifted from a subcritical regime   to a critical regime in the recent past. By contrast to its predecessor,   the model also suggests that a critical transition, and not   self-organized criticality, underlies forest fire dynamics, with   implications for other ecological systems exhibiting power-law-like   patterns, in particular for their sensitivity to environmental change   and control efforts.",1431,NO,SL,,,

Food security is currently considered a major global problem.   However, increasing intensity of food production in agricultural systems   has driven reductions in farmland biodiversity. A major challenge is to   enable biodiversity conservation whilst addressing the problem of food   security.   2. Here we describe how facilitative plant-plant interactions in crop   systems could be used to help strike this balance. An obvious example is   that of intercropping systems, where combinations of crop species can -   under some circumstances - deliver reduced inputs of agrochemicals   (fertilizers, pesticides) per unit yield, with potential knock-on   benefits for biodiversity conservation.   3. Other facilitative processes can also play a role in biodiversity   conservation. Increased intraspecific crop genetic diversity can help   protect crops from pests and diseases. Although overlooked in   facilitation research, we argue that the mechanisms operate in a manner   which is directly analogous to associational defence against herbivores,   a process well recognized in the facilitation literature. As with   intercropping, the benefits to nature conservation arise from reduced   pesticide use per unit harvested crop.   4. Crops may have facilitative effects on some arable weed species,   particularly those that are currently considered rare in intensive   farming systems. Work is in its early stages to understand the   underlying mechanisms, but it appears that crops might create niche   space to which some weed species are adapted. Increasing plant species   diversity through niche space creation may then have cascading benefits   for other components of farmland biodiversity.   5. Our new understanding of facilitative processes arising from work on   crop systems has lessons for the study of facilitative interactions in   natural and semi-natural communities. We argue that, although easier to   identify and quantify in crop systems, some of these facilitative   processes have to date been overlooked in studies of non-crop systems   and certainly deserve further consideration.   6. Finally, we discuss what steps may be needed to move from our   understanding of the role of facilitation to the development of new   agricultural practice. In some cases the challenge may be one of the   encouraging uptake of existing practices, and in others more research is   needed to understand how new ecological understanding might deliver more   sustainable agricultural practice.",1432,NO,SL,,,

In modern agricultural landscapes, many organisms providing ecosystem   services such as pollination and natural pest control are likely   constrained by shortage of nectar and/or pollen required for adult   nutrition. More and more flower-rich field margin strips and other   habitats are created to eliminate these constraints. For most target   organisms, however, it is not well known which (types of) flowers are   effective in providing suitable pollen and nectar.   2. We studied the suitability of a wide range of flowers as a food   source for zoophagous hoverflies (hoverflies with predatory larvae) at   five different levels: nectar accessibility (based on flower   morphology), realized adult fitness, flower choice (both based on cage   experiments), flower visitation and hoverfly abundance in mixed   vegetation (both based on field observations).   3. Realized survival of Episyrphus balteatus is related to effective   flower depth by a sigmoid function. The critical flower depth is 1.6 mm,   which is less than the proboscis size of the hoverfly. For Asteraceae,   the critical floret depth is even less than 1.0 mm, which - in contrast   to common knowledge - rules out most species within this family.   4. Both flower choice in the laboratory and flower visitation rates in   the field are well correlated with nectar accessibility and realized   adult survival.   5. In mixed floral vegetation, the number of zoophagous hoverflies is   highly correlated with the abundance of only those flowers that have   accessible nectar for these hoverflies.   6. Synthesis and applications. This comparative study demonstrates that   nectar (and not pollen) accessibility is the main driver determining   flower resource suitability, flower choice and abundance of zoophagous   hoverflies in arable field margins. The study identifies the limited   range of plant species that can effectively support these beneficial   insects. Preserving the right flowers in and around agricultural fields   could enhance local populations and the pest control and pollination   services they provide.",1433,NO,SL,,,

Four study areas   were selected where changes in vegetation, quite likely attributed to   climate change, have already been observed (dieback of Scots pine and   Greek fir, intrusion of conifers in broadleaved forests). To investigate   the synergism of climatic parameters' alterations in the development of   the occurring phenomena, time series of temperature and precipitation   for the period 1950-2009 were produced and parameters of forest status   were investigated, including mapping of vegetation changes through   remote sensing. The findings support the hypothesis that climate change   has an impact on forest health; the dieback of tree species can be   attributed to outbreaks of pathogens (fungi and insects) which are   associated with climatic parameters. However, the intrusion of conifer   species into broadleaved forests showed no direct connection to climatic   parameters, something that needs to be further investigated. In all   cases, insufficient or inappropriate management practices applied in the   areas exacerbated the occurring phenomena.",1434,NO,SL,,,

One potential   method to restore grassland diversity involves using hemiparasitic   plants to modify the competitive relationships among neighboring   species. A possible candidate is Pedicularis kansuensis, a hemiparasitic   plant found in grasslands throughout the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but more   information on its host associations and its effects on surrounding   vegetation is required to assess its suitability.

A better ability to quantify bat population status and trend   is urgently needed in order to develop effective conservation   strategies. We used a Bayesian autoregressive approach to develop   dynamic distribution models for Myotis lucifugus, the little brown bat,   across a large portion of northwestern USA, using a four-year detection   history matrix obtained from a regional monitoring program. This   widespread and abundant species has experienced precipitous local   population declines in northeastern USA resulting from the novel disease   white-nose syndrome, and is facing likely range-wide declines. Our   models were temporally dynamic and accounted for imperfect detection.   Drawing on species-energy theory, we included measures of net primary   productivity (NPP) and forest cover in models, predicting that M.   lucifugus occurrence probabilities would covary positively along those   gradients.   Despite its common status, M. lucifugus was only detected during similar   to 50\% of the surveys in occupied sample units. The overall naive   estimate for the proportion of the study region occupied by the species   was 0.69, but after accounting for imperfect detection, this increased   to similar to 0.90. Our models provide evidence of an association   between NPP and forest cover and M. lucifugus distribution, with   implications for the projected effects of accelerated climate change in   the region, which include net aridification as snowpack and stream flows   decline. Annual turnover, the probability that an occupied sample unit   was a newly occupied one, was estimated to be low (similar to   0.04-0.14), resulting in flat trend estimated with relatively high   precision (SD = 0.04). We mapped the variation in predicted occurrence   probabilities and corresponding prediction uncertainty along the   productivity gradient. Our results provide a much needed baseline   against which future anticipated declines in M. lucifugus occurrence can   be measured. The dynamic distribution modeling approach has broad   applicability to regional bat monitoring efforts now underway in several   countries and we suggest ways to improve and expand our grid-based   monitoring program to gain robust insights into bat population status   and trend across large portions of North America.",1437,NO,SL,,,

The interactions of the introduced beetle and the   nematode were different by the invasive and native plants, which   suggests that invasive plants and their introduced herbivores have the   potential to alter above- and below-ground interactions and affect   associated community members, which may in turn affect invasion   processes and the safety of classical biocontrol practices.",1440,NO,SL,,,

In particular, parasitism can   differentially affect host fitness among sympatric and interacting host   species. We examined whether the impact of shared parasites varied among   host species within the same community. Specifically, we looked at the   impacts of the acanthocephalan Acanthocephalus galaxii, the trematodes   Coitocaecum parvum and Maritrema poulini, and the nematode Hedruris   spinigera, on three host species: the amphipods, Paracalliope   fluviatilis and Paracorophium excavatum, and the isopod, Austridotea   annectens. We assessed parasite infection levels in the three host   species and tested for effects on host survival, behavior, probability   of pairing, and fecundity. Maritrema poulini and C. parvum were most   abundant in P. excavatum but had no effect on its survival, whereas they   negatively affected the survival of P. fluviatilis, the other amphipod.   Female amphipods carrying young had higher M. poulini and C. parvum   abundance than those without, yet the number of young carried was not   linked to parasite abundance. Behavior of the isopod A. annectens was   affected by M. poulini infection; more heavily infected individuals were   more active. Paracorophium excavatum moved longer distances when   abundance of C. parvum was lower, yet no relationship existed with   respect to infection by both M. poulini and C. parvum. The differential   effects of parasites on amphipods and isopods may lead to community-wide   effects.

We show that the exposure of Daphnia magna clones (of a different   origin) to lake sediment from the Danish Lake Ring, containing dormant   eggs of the epizoic rotifer Brachionus rubens, results in infections   that are associated with increased mortality in Daphnia.   Using a resurrection ecology approach, we reconstructed evolutionary   change in the Lake Ring D.magna population in response to B.rubens   infections.

Both sediment exposure and time period from which Lake Ring clones were   isolated affected important life-history parameters, suggesting that   evolution (upon exposure to Brachionus) not only affected resistance to   Brachionus, but also other traits in Lake Ring Daphnia.   Additionally, there were complex effects of a joint exposure of D.magna   to rotifers and the indirect effect of fish predation: exposure to fish   kairomones resulted in an increased allocation of energy to early   reproduction and Daphnia performance.

Thus, large estuaries of the tropics are of primary   interest for biodiversity conservation, and the processes underpinning   the distribution of fish diversity in these ecosystems deserve   attention. Factors controlling biodiversity patterns have been the focus   of numerous recent investigations and include species interactions,   speciation, environmental gradients and heterogeneity, with all of these   operating differently at each observation scale. Today, the question is   no longer whether particular biodiversity patterns occur, but why they   occur and whether they are consistent across scales and organisms under   study. In this study we combined the results of 2 classical ecological   patterns, namely diversity-biomass relationships and species   co-occurrences, into a common framework. Fish sampling was carried out   in the coastal Terminos Lagoon (southern Gulf of Mexico) during 2   periods (1980-1981 and 1998-1999) using 408 tows. A total of 22 834   individuals representing 106 fish species were collected. Our study   revealed that both diversity-biomass relationships and species   co-occurrences show inconsistent patterns across years, seasons and   zones. However, taken together, our results show that C-score values,   which measure spatiotemporal segregation among species, were closely   related to the shape of observed richness-biomass relationships. When   fish assemblages showed positive C-score values (species segregation),   the relationship between species richness and fish biomass was either   hump-shaped or non-significant. Conversely, negative C-score values   (species aggregation) were associated with an increase in fish species   richness along the total biomass gradient.

Within the tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) - fungal endophyte   (Neotyphodium coenophialum) symbiosis, fungal produced alkaloids are   often invoked as the putative mechanism driving these ecological   responses. Yet few measurements of alkaloids exist in the ecological   literature. In this study, we quantified alkaloid levels in live,   standing dead and decomposing endophyte-infected (E+) and -free (E-)   plant material and simultaneously evaluated the direct and indirect   effects of endophyte presence on tall fescue decomposition.   Loline and ergot alkaloid levels were consistently high in live E+   (common toxic strain of N. coenophialum) tall fescue biomass throughout   the sampling period (May-November 2007), whereas, E- live and standing   dead material had non-detectable alkaloid concentrations. Standing dead   E+ biomass had significantly reduced alkaloid levels (6-19x lower than   the levels measured in the corresponding live E+ biomass) that were   equivalent to E- live and dead for loline but were still somewhat higher   than E- material for ergots.   In an effort to test the role of alkaloids in directly inhibiting   decomposition, as has been suggested by previous studies, we conducted a   litter bag experiment using green, alkaloid-laden E+ and alkaloid-free   E- tall fescue plant material. We incubated E+ and E- litter bags in   both E+ and E- tall fescue stands for 170 days, and measured mass loss,   carbon and nitrogen content, and ergot and loline alkaloid   concentrations over the incubation period.   Consistent with previous reports, both direct and indirect effects of   endophyte presence on litter decomposition were observed: endophyte   presence in the litter and surrounding microenvironment significantly   reduced decomposition rates. Surprisingly, despite large differences in   alkaloid content between E+ and E- litter from Day 0-Day 21 of the   incubation, direct effects of the endophyte on litter decomposition,   while significant, were relatively small (differences in mass loss   between E+ and E- litter were never > 3\%). Alkaloids were gone from E+   material by day 56.   We propose that results from this study indicating alkaloids are largely   absent in standing dead material (the typical input to the decomposition   process), and that despite being present in our litter bag experiment,   failed to produce large differences in mass loss between E+ and E-   material questions the supposition that fungal produced alkaloids   directly inhibit decomposition.

We used camera traps on wolf kills to investigate the   role of scavenging on predator and multiprey dynamics in a northern   Apennine system in Italy. In contrast to North American systems, the   omnivorous wild boar successfully competes with wolves for the meat of   their kills. We developed a deterministic, multitrophic web model (wolf,   vegetation, deer, and wild boar), tunable through a parameter that   governs the impact of prey sharing between wolves and wild boar. When   prey sharing is scarce, populations oscillate, but above a threshold   value the trophic web is stabilized, with the regime solution becoming a   fixed, stable point. Both deer and wild boar then increase as a function   of prey sharing, and the impact of herbivores on the vegetation   increases. When prey sharing exceeds another threshold, the system   collapses due to the extinction of both wolves and wild boar. Our   analysis shows that scavenging is crucial for the dynamics of this   ecosystem, and thus it should not be overlooked in food web modeling.   The exploitation of wolf kills by wild boar may allow juveniles and   yearlings to obtain high-quality resources that are not usually   available, helping the wild boar to compensate for losses caused by   hunting.

MethodWe carried out a meta-analysis examining the effects of biotic   disturbance on 16 variables associated with below-ground C processes,   based on 64 experimental studies.   ResultsBiotic disturbance significantly decreased below-ground C pools   with relatively long residence times (e.g. root biomass and soil organic   carbon, SOC), but increased labile C pools (e.g. microbial biomass   carbon, MBC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC), soil respiration (Rs) and   its components, and microbial population sizes.

Main conclusionsBiotic disturbance can have stronger impacts on   below-ground C processes than other environmental changes, and the   sensitive responses of soil labile C pools and C fluxes to biotic   disturbance decrease long-term below-ground C sequestration.

Frequently, such mutualisms are reformed each generation, and where they   involve close physiological contact, such as between mycorrhizal fungi   and plants, they can be considered as examples of reciprocal parasitism.   Here we place such interactions in the framework of the Prisoner's   Dilemma, and examine the conditions for the spread of mutualism using a   population genetics model analogous to that used for understanding the   genetic and numerical dynamics of host-parasite interactions. Genetic   variants within each of two species determine whether the interaction is   mutualistic or selfish, the latter being represented by resistance to   being exploited or parasitized. We assume that there are fitness costs   to resistance which are present even in the absence of the interaction.   Just as in host-parasite interactions, we examine the effect of assuming   that encounter rates between potential mutualists (and therefore entry   into the Prisoner's Dilemma `game') depend on the density and frequency   of the different types interacting individuals. These elements of   ecological realism greatly facilitate the evolution of mutualism even in   the absence of spatial structure or iterative encounters. Moreover,   stable genetic polymorphisms for resistant (selfish) and susceptible   (mutualistic) alleles can be maintained, something that is not possible   with the classical Prisoner's Dilemma formulation. The sensitivity of   the outcomes to levels of density-dependence and mortality rate suggests   environmental as well as genetic processes are likely to be important in   determining directions in this pathway to mutualism.",1451,NO,SL,,,

Neotyphodium is an asexual, vertically transmitted   endophytic symbiont of grasses often existing in hybrid form.   Hybridization in Neotyphodium rapidly increases the symbiotum's genomic   content and is likely to increase the phenotypic variation of the host.   This phenotypic variation is predicted to enhance host performance,   especially in stressful environments. We tested this hypothesis by   comparing the growth, survival, and resource allocation of hybrid and   nonhybrid infected host plants exposed to controlled variation in soil   moisture and nutrients. Infection by a hybrid endophyte did not fit our   predictions of comparatively higher root and total biomass production   under low moisture/low nutrient treatments. Regardless of whether the   host was infected by a hybrid or nonhybrid endophyte, both produced   significantly higher root/total biomass when both nutrient and moisture   were high compared to limited nutrient/moisture treatments.

These changes will alter the pathways by   which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture   facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread   of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood   of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or   winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the   construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species.   Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by   enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and   by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate   change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier   construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive   species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by   seasonally unfavorable conditions, Although most researchers focus on   how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions,   some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new   climate conditions.

The distributions of parasites with complex life cycles   depend on interactions between multiple host species, suggesting the net   effects of land use on infection patterns may be difficult to predict a   priori. Here, we used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the   importance of land use and spatial scale (local, watershed, and   regional) in determining the presence and abundance of multi-host   trematodes of amphibians. Among 40 wetlands and 160 hosts sampled,   trematode abundance, species richness, and the presence and abundance of   pathogenic species were strongly influenced by variables at the   watershed and regional scales. Based on model averaging results, overall   parasite richness and abundance were higher in forested wetlands than in   agricultural areas; however, this pattern was influenced by a wetland's   proximity to the Mississippi Flyway at the regional scale. These   patterns likely reflect the activity of trematode definitive hosts, such   as mammals and especially birds, such that infections decreased with   increasing distance from the Mississippi River. Interestingly, despite   lower mean infections, agricultural wetlands had higher variances and   maximum infections. At the wetland scale, phosphorus concentrations and   the abundances of intermediate hosts, such as snails and larval   amphibians, positively affected parasite distributions.

Development of the   sexual stage of the pathogen was split into different state variables,   in which changes from one state to another were regulated by rates   depending on environmental conditions. The conceptual model was based on   the definition of a primary inoculum season, a seasonal oospore   (inoculum) dose, and its division into many coeval cohorts. Each cohort   progresses along the primary infection cycle (production and survival of   sporangia, release, survival and dispersal of zoospores, infection,   appearance of disease symptoms) simultaneously, with a time step of one   hour. The model was evaluated over a 12-year period (1995-2006) in   Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy) by comparing simulations with actual   observations of the first seasonal symptoms of downy mildew in 43   vineyards. This data set was not used in model building and represents   different environmental conditions, with both early and late primary   infections. The model showed high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.   The achieved probabilities that an oospore cohort produce or not an   infection were 0.994 and 0.999, respectively, while there was   practically no probability that an oospore cohort produce infection when   infection is not predicted by the model. Because of a small probability   (< 0.01) that a predicted infection is not a true infection, confidence   in prediction of non-infections was higher than in prediction of   infections. Most of the wrong positive predictions occurred in early   season, when the host was in the earlier growth stages, or when the   oospore germination was triggered by isolated weak rain events.   Considering that neither calibration nor empirical adjustment of model   parameters were necessary to obtain accurate simulation, it was   concluded that this model produces a reasonable approximation of the   primary infection processes underlying oospore development. The model   showed that 86\% of the oospore cohorts failed infection, because   sporangia did not survive till zoospore release (5.6\% of these   cohorts), zoospores released from sporangia did not survive until   dispersal (83.6\%), or the zoospores that dispersed to leaves did not   cause infection (10.8\%).

Despite the strong impact parasites can have, only few models of   phytoplankton ecology or aquatic food webs have specifically included   parasitism. 2. Here, we provide a susceptible-infected model for a   diatom-chytrid hostparasite system that explicitly includes nutrients,   infected and uninfected hosts, reproduction of the parasite on the hosts   and free-living infective stages. 3. A distinguishing feature of the   model is that parasite reproduction on host increases with nutrient   availability to the infected host, as has been observed for many   parasites and viruses. 4. It follows from this assumption that the   parasite's basic reproduction number, R0, increases with nutrient   concentration, because at higher nutrient concentrations, infected hosts   consume more nutrients that are used for the reproduction of the   parasite. 5. Another important result is that there may be two   alternative states to which population densities can converge: one with   only the host and one with host and parasite co-existing. In the latter,   the parasite can invade a host population only if it is introduced above   a threshold density. 6. Furthermore, the model shows a strong tendency   for hostparasite cycles, which may be chaotic. Nutrient enrichment leads   to increasing amplitude of these cycles, which may cause host or   parasite population extinction caused by stochastic fluctuations during   periods of low population density, which is the Paradox of Enrichment.   7. Finally, if alternative states and cycles co-occur, increased   population cycle amplitude may drive the parasite below its threshold   density for successful invasion, causing parasite extinction in a   deterministic Paradox of Enrichment'. Published results confirm that   hostparasite cycles and collapse of hostparasite systems may occur in   real plankton communities. 8. Our results underline that ecological   detail in hostparasite models may have consequences for disease dynamics   that may be overlooked when ecological interactions between environment,   host and parasite are not explicitly taken into account.",1456,NO,SL,,,

Culicoides biting midges are vectors of internationally important   arboviruses including bluetongue virus (BTV). The ecological constraints   imposed by the small body size of these insects strongly influence the   epidemiology of the diseases they can carry. Bluetongue virus recently   emerged in northern Europe, and atmospheric dispersion models have   subsequently been employed to simulate vector movement (and hence likely   spread of BTV). The data underlying such models, however, have hitherto   either been obtained from small-scale studies or from outside the   northwestern Palaearctic.   2. The effects of seasonality and local meteorological conditions upon   the daily presence and abundance of Culicoides vectors were examined   using 2760 samples collected across a network of 12 different habitat   types in England during 2008. Over 50 000 individuals were estimated to   be in the samples with males constituting 62\% of the total collection,   allowing straightforward comparison between potential vector species in   terms of their activity rates and seasonality. Culicoides abundance was   linked to livestock density and land use. Farm-associated Culicoides   species were recorded at all sites including species thought to be   restricted to this ecosystem by larval habitat, suggesting a greater   potential for dispersal over land than previously thought.   3. Synthesis and applications. The model developed has already been   applied in a functional dispersion model to predict disease risk from   wind-borne infected Culicoides incursion into the UK and elsewhere. The   study has expounded the long-distance dispersal potential of Culicoides,   essential for future prediction of the incursion and spread of   Culicoides-borne pathogens. It has additionally contributed to the   understanding of the ecology of highly dispersive insect vectors.",1457,NO,SL,,,

While great effort has been made in documenting the processes that   drive plant-induced susceptibility after herbivore attack and it is   widely accepted that herbivores can facilitate plant diseases, the   relative importance of this interaction in controlling plant growth in   natural systems remains largely unexplored.   2. In south-western Atlantic salt marshes, we investigated the   importance of disease after herbivory by examining: (i) whether or not a   herbivorous crab facilitates disease (i.e. fungus infection) in marsh   plants (Spartina alterniflora and S. densiflora) when clipping off small   portions of leaves and (ii) the separate and interactive effects of crab   grazing but fungal infection in controlling marsh plant growth.   3. Our results show that crab grazing facilitates fungal infection in   Spartina leaves. A factorial field experiment shows that both direct   crab herbivory and fungal infection strongly suppress plant production   (by more than 50\%).   4. Synthesis. These experimental results demonstrate that fungal   infection following herbivory attack can decrease salt marsh plant   production and that increased disease susceptibility can be a   fundamental factor in controlling plant production in natural   ecosystems, even in cases where herbivores do not directly inoculate the   pathogen but only damage plant tissue.",1458,YES,SL,yes,,

As a large share of the power generation is   currently based on fossil fuels, mainly coal, with this trend expected   to continue, clean coal technologies need to be developed. Carbon   capture and storage using chemical solvents has been identified to be   the most suitable option for coal-fired power plants. The technology   which is closest to market commercialisation uses amines, such as   monoethanolamine, as a solvent. However, high degradation rates due to   impurities present in the flue gas and a considerable heat requirement   for solvent regeneration make the application of alternative solvents   necessary.

However, epiphytic species can play a crucial role in   litter input throughout the growing season. This work evaluates changes   in litter production by mistletoe (Misodendrum sp.) and epiphytic lichen   (Usnea sp.), related to crown cover in mature unmanaged, second-growth   and managed (thinned for silvopastoral use) forests in Tierra del Fuego   (Argentina). We used plastic traps to collect litterfall biomass from   trees, lichens and mistletoes on a monthly basis over three consecutive   years. Tree litter was considerable during autumn (March to May), which   is typical of Nothofagus deciduous species in the Southern hemisphere.   In contrast, peak litterfall from mistletoes and lichens occurred during   spring and summer seasons. Tree litter (1954-3398 kg dry matter ha(-1)   year(-1)) was correlated with crown cover gradient being highest in   second-growth forests and lowest in thinned sites. While litter input   from mistletoes did not vary among forest types (307 -333 kg dry matter   ha(-1) year(-1)), lichen litter (11-40 kg dry matter ha(-1) year(-1))   was higher in unmanaged and thinned mature forests despite differences   in tree crown cover. Contrary to what we expected, the management   practices investigated here did not affect the biomass of canopy   communities compared to unmanaged mature forests.

Although several studies reported   a positive diversity - productivity relationship, the role of soil   animals has been largely neglected. Nematodes are among the most   widespread and important herbivores causing substantial yield losses in   agriculture; however, impacts of nematodes on the diversity -   productivity relationship in semi-natural plant communities have not   been investigated until today.   In the framework of the Jena Experiment (Thuringia, Germany) we   established control and nematicide treated subplots to manipulate   nematode densities on plots varying in plant species (1-16) and   functional group richness (1-4). We explored the interacting effects of   nematicide application and plant diversity on the main trophic groups of   nematodes and on aboveground plant productivity.   Nematicide application reduced the number of nematodes significantly,   particularly that of plant feeders and predators. The negative impact of   nematicide application on plant and bacterial feeders depended however   on the diversity of the plant community. Total plant shoot biomass   tended to decrease in the presence of ambient nematode densities. In   detail, nematode effects varied however with plant functional group   identity by reducing only the shoot biomass of herbs significantly but   not that of legumes. Furthermore, the shoot biomass of grasses tended to   decrease in the presence of ambient nematode densities. In contrast to   total shoot biomass, nematodes decreased grass shoot biomass only in   high diverse but not in low diverse plant communities. Thus, the present   study for the first time highlights that nematodes likely modify the   community structure und functions of semi-natural plant communities by   altering the competition between plant functional groups and by   attenuating the diversity - productivity relationship.

We studied the interaction patterns of 149 female elk (Cervus   canadensis) distributed across five different regions of western Wyoming   over three years, defining a contact as an approach within one body   length (approximate to 2 m). Using hierarchical models that account for   correlations within individuals, pairs, and groups, we found that   pairwise contact rates within a group declined by a factor of three as   group sizes increased 33-fold. Per capita contact rates, however,   increased with group size according to a power function, such that   female elk contact rates fell in between the predictions of density- or   frequency-dependent disease models. We found similar patterns for the   duration of contacts. Our results suggest that larger elk groups are   likely to play a disproportionate role in the disease dynamics of   directly transmitted infections in elk. Supplemental feeding of elk had   a limited impact on pairwise interaction rates and durations, but per   capita rates were more than two times higher on feeding grounds. Our   statistical approach decomposes the variation in contact rate into   individual, dyadic, and environmental effects, and provides insight into   factors that may be targeted by disease control programs. In particular,   female elk contact patterns were driven more by environmental factors   such as group size than by either individual or dyad effects.",1466,NO,SL,,,

The largest extant marsupial carnivore, the   Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is threatened with extinction   from a transmissible cancer, devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). The   disease, first observed in 1996, has led to apparent population declines   in excess of 95\% in some areas and has spread to more than 80\% of   their range. We analyzed a long-term Tasmania-wide data set derived from   wildlife spotlighting surveys to assess the effects of DFTD-induced   devil decline on populations of other mammals and to examine the   relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control of mesopredators   between 2 regions with different environmental conditions. Collection of   the data began >10 years before DFTD was first observed. A decrease in   devil populations was immediate across diseased regions following DFTD   arrival, and there has been no indication of population recovery. Feral   cats (Felis catus) increased in areas where the disease was present the   longest, and feral cat occurrence was significantly and negatively   associated with devils. The smallest mesopredator, the eastern quoll   (Dasyurus viverrinus), declined rapidly following DFTD arrival. This   result suggests the species was indirectly protected by devils through   the suppression of larger predators. Rainfall deficiency was also a   significant predictor of their decline. Environmental variables   determined the relative importance of top-down control in the population   regulation of mesopredators. In landscapes of low rainfall and   relatively higher proportions of agriculture and human settlement,   top-down forces were dampened and bottom-up forces had the most effect   on mesopredators. For herbivore prey species, there was evidence of   population differences after DFTD arrival, but undetected environmental   factors had greater effects. The unique opportunity to assess population   changes over extensive temporal and spatial scales following apex   predator loss further demonstrated their role in structuring ecosystems   and of productivity in determining the strength of top-down control.",1467,MAYBE,SL,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

The newly developed models are applied to a   theoretical study of the utilisation of bauxite residue, a by-product of   alumina processing enriched in natural radionuclides, in building   materials. The ecosystem models have significant sensitivity to   uncertainties surrounding the differential environmental fate of parent   and daughter radionuclides that are produced as a part of decay chains,   and to assumptions regarding long term releases from landfill sites.   However, conservative results for environmental exposure suggest that in   addition to landfill of materials, power consumption (burning coal and   mining uranium) is a potentially significant source of radiological   impact to the environment. From a human perspective, exposure to NORM in   the use phase of building materials is the dominant source of impact,   with environmental releases of nuclides playing a comparatively minor   role. At an endpoint level, the impact of NORM exposure is highly   significant in comparison to other impact categories in the area of   protection of human health. The dose increase is of an order of   magnitude comparable to lifestyle factors. The results highlight the   importance within LCA of having sufficient impact assessment models to   capture all potential impacts, such that issues of burden shifting   between impact measures can be captured, interpreted and resolved in the   optimisation of product systems.

Inter-individual differences among human   subjects were confirmed and microbial patterns unique for each   individual were preserved in vitro. Furthermore, in correspondence with   in vivo studies, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were enriched in the   luminal content while Firmicutes rather colonized the mucin layer, with   Clostridium cluster XIVa accounting for almost 60\% of the mucin-adhered   microbiota. Of the many acetate and/or lactate-converting butyrate   producers within this cluster, Roseburia intestinalis and Eubacterium   rectale most specifically colonized mucins.

Correspondingly, the   simulated mucosal environment induced a shift from acetate towards   butyrate. As not only inter-individual differences were preserved but   also because compared with conventional models, washout of relevant   mucin-adhered microbes was avoided, simulating the mucosal gut   microbiota represents a breakthrough in modeling and mechanistically   studying the human intestinal microbiome in health and disease.

Plant species selected for reintroduction on the basis of   present occurrence near the site (many of which also occur there as   fossils), and species not present but selected solely on the basis of   fossil occurrence before European arrival, both show high survival rates   in most cases. Species that fit neither of these criteria, but are   judged suitable on the basis of their occurrence elsewhere on the island   in similar habitats, generally showed lower survival rates.

Environmentally, four main concerns are mapped out: first,   there are potential water safety risks, such as water resource abuse,   water pollution and groundwater recharge deficiency; second,   unreasonable construction will lead to land-use overexpansion, land   pollution and service expectancy reduction; third, microalgae production   may exert a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem, causing algal   blooms and biological invasion; finally, microalgae might emit   unexpected greenhouse gases [nitrogen oxides (NO x ), methane (CH4)]   and ammonia (NH3). From an economic risk standpoint, microalgae   production requires an overwhelming investment due to the expensive   start-up and operation. Socially, contaminant discharge will threaten   the health of local animals and people. Moreover, the safety effects of   genetically modified algae may not be immediately apparent or known. In   addition, over time, microalgae may become a medium for mosquitoes to   spread disease. From a cultural point of view, it requires time for   people in developing countries to adapt algal oil to their daily life as   an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, personnel   changes in the workforce may harm existing cultural structures, and   landscape aesthetics may be affected by system construction. Taking the   above challenges into consideration, efficient government policies,   proactive company behaviours and positive public participation will play   an important role in minimising or even eliminating these potential   risks.",1474,NO,SL,,,

Systematic analysis of the effect of alternative model   structures, however, is often beyond the resources typically available   to ecologists, ecological risk practitioners, and natural resource   managers. Many of these practitioners are also using Bayesian belief   networks based on expert opinion to fill gaps in empirical information.   The practical application of this approach can be limited by the need to   populate large conditional probability tables and the complexity   associated with ecological feedback cycles. In this paper, we describe a   modeling approach that helps solve these problems by embedding a   qualitative analysis of sign directed graphs into the probabilistic   framework of a Bayesian belief network. Our approach incorporates the   effects of feedback on the model's response to a sustained change in one   or more of its parameters, provides an efficient means to explore the   effect of alternative model structures, mitigates the cognitive bias in   expert opinion, and is amenable to stakeholder input. We demonstrate our   approach by examining two published case studies: a host-parasitoid   community centered on a nonnative, agricultural pest of citrus cultivars   and the response of an experimental lake mesocosm to nutrient input.   Observations drawn from these case studies are used to diagnose   alternative model structures and to predict the system's response   following management intervention.",1475,NO,SL,,,

Other   introduced species of plants, animals and pathogens cause massive, rapid   and often irreversible changes in the recipient communities, of a   magnitude rarely produced by native species. Understanding such   invasions, and the great. range of impacts caused by introduced species,   will probably require at least some approaches different from those of   other sciences of vegetation change.

Pathogen invasion often succeeds physical wounding and injury, yet links   between the reduction of damage and the moderation of disease have not   been assessed. Here, we examine the utility of no-take marine reserves   as tools for mitigating diseases that affect reef-building corals. We   found that sites located within reserves had fourfold reductions in   coral disease prevalence compared to non-reserve sites (80 466 corals   surveyed). Of 31 explanatory variables assessed, coral damage and the   abundance of derelict fishing line best explained differences in disease   assemblages between reserves and non-reserves. Unexpectedly, we recorded   significantly higher levels of disease, coral damage, and derelict   fishing line in non-reserves with fishing gear restrictions than in   those without gear restrictions. Fishers targeting stocks perceived to   be less depleted, coupled with enhanced site access from immediately   adjacent boat moorings, may explain these unexpected patterns.   Significant correlations between the distance from mooring sites and   prevalence values for a ciliate disease known to infest wounded tissue   (r = -0.65), coral damage (r = -0.64), and the abundance of derelict   fishing line (r = -0.85) corroborate this interpretation. This is the   first study to link disease with recreational use intensity in a park,   emphasizing the need to evaluate the placement of closures and their   direct relationship to ecosystem health. Since corals are modular,   ecological processes that govern reproductive and competitive fitness   are frequently related to colony surface area therefore, even low levels   of cumulative tissue loss from progressing diseases pose significant   threats to reef coral persistence.

In such instances, many beneficial adaptations may be   eliminated even if the population later increases again. Conversely,   immigration may successfully counter the adverse effect of reduced   population size, bringing new or lost alleles and replenishing thus   genetic diversity of a reduced population. Extensive groundwater   abstraction from the Azraq Oasis led to a considerable deterioration of   the unique wetland ecosystem during the 1980s and most of the aquatic   vegetation consequently died off in the early 1990s. At that time,   numbers of local reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) dramatically   dropped to a few pairs. The numbers slightly increased again after   wetland restoration efforts were begun. To infer possible consequences   of the population collapse on genetic diversity, we genotyped 40 local   breeders at 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci. After 15 years from the   crash, the population showed no evidence for past genetic bottlenecks.   The absence of reduced genetic diversity suggests that the population   has largely benefited front gene flow.

Although research has   focused on the resistance of tree populations and communities to these   novel precipitation regimes, resilience of forests is also contingent on   recovery following drought, which remains poorly understood, especially   in aseasonal tropical forests. We used rainfall exclusion shelters to   manipulate the interannual frequency of drought for diverse seedling   communities in a tropical forest and assessed resistance, recovery and   resilience of seedling growth and mortality relative to everwet   conditions. We found seedlings exposed to recurrent periods of drought   altered their growth rates throughout the year relative to seedlings in   everwet conditions. During drought periods, seedlings grew slower than   seedlings in everwet conditions (i.e., resistance phase) while   compensating with faster growth after drought (i.e., recovery phase).   However, the response to frequent drought was species dependent as some   species grew significantly slower with frequent drought relative to   everwet conditions while others grew faster with frequent drought due to   overcompensating growth during the recovery phase. In contrast,   mortality was unrelated to rainfall conditions and instead correlated   with differences in light. Intra-annual plasticity of growth and   increased annual growth of some species led to an overall maintenance of   growth rates of tropical seedling communities in response to more   frequent drought. These results suggest these communities can   potentially adapt to predicted climate change scenarios and that   plasticity in the growth of species, and not solely changes in mortality   rates among species, may contribute to shifts in community composition   under drought.",1483,NO,SL,,,

Algae were maintained in aquaria during 1year at near-ambient   conditions of irradiance, at ambient or elevated temperature (+3 degrees   C), and at ambient (ca. 400atm) or elevated pCO2 (ca. 700atm).   Respiration, photosynthesis, and net calcification showed a strong   seasonal pattern following the seasonal variations of temperature and   irradiance, with higher rates in summer than in winter. Respiration was   unaffected by pCO2 but showed a general trend of increase at elevated   temperature at all seasons, except in summer under elevated pCO2.   Conversely, photosynthesis was strongly affected by pCO2 with a decline   under elevated pCO2 in summer, autumn, and winter. In particular,   photosynthetic efficiency was reduced under elevated pCO2. Net   calcification showed different responses depending on the season. In   summer, net calcification increased with rising temperature under   ambient pCO2 but decreased with rising temperature under elevated pCO2.   Surprisingly, the highest rates in summer were found under elevated pCO2   and ambient temperature. In autumn, winter, and spring, net   calcification exhibited a positive or no response at elevated   temperature but was unaffected by pCO2. The rate of calcification of   L.cabiochae was thus maintained or even enhanced under increased pCO2.   However, there is likely a trade-off with other physiological processes.   For example, photosynthesis declines in response to increased pCO2 under   ambient irradiance. The present study reports only on the physiological   response of healthy specimens to ocean warming and acidification,   however, these environmental changes may affect the vulnerability of   coralline algae to other stresses such as pathogens and necroses that   can cause major dissolution, which would have critical consequence for   the sustainability of coralligenous habitats and the budgets of carbon   and calcium carbonate in coastal Mediterranean ecosystems.",1484,NO,SL,,,

However, the majority of these efforts   concentrate on long-term equilibrium dynamics of linear systems and   their underlying assumptions and, therefore, omit the analysis of   transience. Since management decisions are typically concerned with the   short term (<100 years), asymptotic analyses could lead to inaccurate   conclusions or, worse yet, critical parameters or processes of   ecological concern may go undetected altogether.   We present a stage-structured, deterministic, nonlinear, disease model   which is parameterized for the population dynamics of high-elevation   white pines in the face of infection with white pine blister rust   (WPBR). We evaluate the model using newly developed software to   calculate sensitivity and elasticity for nonlinear population models at   any projected time step. We concentrate on two points in time, during   transience and at equilibrium, and under two scenarios: a regenerating   pine stand following environmental disturbance and a stand perturbed by   the introduction of WPBR.   The model includes strong density-dependent effects on population   dynamics, particularly on seedling recruitment, and results in a   structure favoring large trees. However, the introduction of WPBR and   its associated disease-induced mortality alters stand structure in favor   of smaller stages. Populations with infection probability (beta) greater   than or similar to 0.1 do not reach a stable coexisting equilibrium and   deterministically approach extinction.   The model enables field observations of low infection prevalence among   pine seedlings to be reinterpreted as resulting from disease-induced   mortality and short residence time in the seedling stage..   Sensitivities and elasticities, combined with model output, suggest that   future efforts should focus on improving estimates of within-stand   competition, infection probability, and infection cost to survivorship.

The accumulation of   beneficial or antagonistic biota over time can have strong positive or   negative effects on the recruitment of new individuals into the   population (i.e., plant-soil feedback, PSF). Despite the potential   influence of PSF on plant diversity in terrestrial ecosystems, our   understanding of its determinants remains incomplete. Within forests,   recent evidence indicates that mycorrhizal type can regulate PSF:   Arbuscular mycorrhizal trees typically experience negative PSF, while   ectomycorrhizal trees experience positive PSF. Other studies have found   that plant traits and the local environment also affect PSF; yet, these   studies are based on arbuscular mycorrhizal plants in herbaceous   systems. Consequently, the relationship between PSF and plant traits or   the environment may depend on the mycorrhizal type of the tree. Using   PSF measurements for 520 populations belonging to 52 North American   temperate forest tree species, we tested whether mycorrhizal type   influences how plant traits and climate relate to PSF. For both   mycorrhizal types, species that produced larger seeds and were less   drought tolerant had more positive (or less negative) PSF. Precipitation   during the dry season was negatively related to PSF, but only for   arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. These results suggest that investing more   resources in seeds may minimize PSF for tree species, irrespective of   mycorrhizal type. Species that have historically been exposed to greater   pathogen abundances in wetter environments may also be better defended   against attack, minimizing negative PSF. However, for species currently   found in wetter environments, PSF may be strongly negative if their   mycorrhizas do not defend them against attack, as is common among   arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. Combined, these results highlight the   importance of mycorrhizal type in determining the relationship between   PSF and climate, but indicate that the relationship between PSF and   plant traits may be independent of mycorrhizal type. Nevertheless,   mycorrhizal type remains an important consideration when studying PSF,   and forest dynamics in general.",1487,NO,SL,,,

High host density in patches   increases contact rate between hosts and parasites, increasing parasite   transmission success. At the same time, for environmentally transmitted   parasites, high host density can decrease infection risk to individual   hosts, because infective stages are divided among all hosts in a patch,   leading to safety in numbers. We tested these predictions using the   California horn snail, Cerithideopsis californica (=Cerithidea   californica), which is the first intermediate host for at least 19   digenean trematode species in California estuaries. Snails become   infected by ingesting trematode eggs or through penetration by   free-swimming miracidia that hatch from trematode eggs deposited with   final-host (bird or mammal) feces. This complex life cycle decouples   infective-stage production from transmission, raising the possibility of   an inverse relationship between host density and infection risk at local   scales. In a field survey, higher snail density was associated with   increased trematode (infected snail) density, but decreased trematode   prevalence, consistent with either safety in numbers, parasitic   castration, or both. To determine the extent to which safety in numbers   drove the negative snail-density-trematode-prevalence association, we   manipulated uninfected snail density in 83 cages at eight sites within   Carpinteria Salt Marsh (California, USA). At each site, we quantified   snail density and used data on final-host (bird and raccoon)   distributions to control for between-site variation in infective-stage   supply. After three months, overall trematode infections per cage   increased with snail biomass density. For egg-transmitted trematodes,   per-snail infection risk decreased with snail biomass density in the   cage and surrounding area, whereas per-snail infection risk did not   decrease for miracidium-transmitted trematodes. Furthermore, both   trematode recruitment and infection risk increased with infective-stage   input, but this was significant only for miracidium-transmitted species.   A model parameterized with our experimental results and snail densities   from 524 field transects estimated that safety in numbers, when combined   with patchy host density, halved per capita infection risk in this snail   population. We conclude that, depending on transmission mode, host   density can enhance parasite recruitment and reduce per capita infection   risk.",1488,NO,SL,,,

Benthologists publishing in   J-NABS have contributed robustly to our overall knowledge of predation   and herbivory but less so of other species interactions. Predators can   limit the abundance of benthic prey and affect prey size or age   Structure, behavior, and morphology, and these effects can be   transmitted through food webs and ecosystems. Herbivores can limit   biomass of benthic algae, alter physiognomy, species composition and   diversity, and stoichiometry, and exert strong indirect effects within   food webs and nutrient cycles. Parasites can alter host behavior or   morphology, but few Studies have shown that lethal/sublethal effects of   parasites on their hosts have population- or community-scale   consequences. Fishes and macroinvertebrates occasionally experience   competition, but the effect of competition on demographies and   assemblages appears restricted to local scales, perhaps because   competition can be modulated by many biotic (bioenergetic efficiency,   parasitism, predation) and abiotic (floods, drought, resource   distribution) factors. Positive interactions have been the least Studied   species interaction by benthologists, but interest is growing Future   study of population-scale positive interactions and nontraditional   interactions at larger scales (e g, riparian effects on benthic habitat   stabilization, cross-system recruitment of different life stages) will   improve our understanding of freshwater benthic ecosystems and their   conservation We urge benthologists to explore how Populations evolve in   response to biotic interactions embedded in benthic communities and to   assess how these responses might redefine trophic and community   structure and their emergent properties",1490,NO,SL,,,

Both the prokaryotic and viral abundance and production showed a   significantly decreasing trend from epipelagic to meso-and bathypelagic   waters. Viral abundance decreased from 0.36-1.05x10(10) particles L-1 to   0.43-0.80x10(9) particles L-1, while the virus : prokaryote ratio varied   from 7.21 to 16.23 to 2.45-23.40, at the surface and 2000 m,   respectively.

Suppression of pathogens is known to be context-dependent and to vary   between plant species, yet the significance of plant identity in shaping   rhizosphere bacterial functioning in multi-species communities is   largely unknown. We questioned whether the activity of a rhizosphere   bacterium in producing biocontrol compounds varies with plant identity   in a plant diversity gradient. We set up a gnotobiotic microcosm   experiment with the model rhizosphere bacterium Pseudomonas protegens   CHA0, an important biocontrol agent, and investigated the effects of   plant identity and diversity on its production of biocontrol compounds.   Using GFP-based reporter fusions, we assessed gene expression linked to   the production of the biocontrol compounds 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol,   pyrrolnitrin and hydrogen cyanide. The expression of genes coding for   biocontrol compounds was driven to a large extent by plant identity and   this effect persisted along the plant species richness gradient for all   tested genes. Notably, the effect of certain plant identities varied   between the three tested genes, indicating a selective impact of plant   species on bacterial gene expression. However, some plant species, such   as Lolium perenne, consistently stimulated bacterial gene expression   irrespective of the diversity of the plant community.

We quantified production and consumption of stream-dwelling   tadpoles and insect grazers in a headwater stream in the Panamanian   uplands for 2 years to assess their effects on basal resources and   energy fluxes. At the onset of our study, this region had healthy,   diverse amphibian populations, but a catastrophic disease-driven decline   began in September 2004, which greatly reduced amphibian populations.   2. Insect grazer production was 348 mg ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m-2   year-1 during the first year of the study and increased slightly to 402   mg AFDM m-2 year-1 during the second year.   3. Prior to amphibian declines, resource consumption by grazers   (tadpoles and insects) was estimated at 2.9 g AFDM m-2 year-1 of algal   primary production, which was nearly twice the estimated amount   available. Insect grazers alone accounted for c. 81\% of total primary   consumption. During the initial stages of the declines, consumption   remained at c. 2.9 g AFDM m-2 year-1, but only 35\% of the available   resource was being consumed and insect grazers accounted for c. 94\% of   total consumption.   4. Production and resource consumption of some insect grazers increased   during the second year, as tadpoles declined, indicating a potential for   functional redundancy in this system. However, other insect grazer taxa   declined or did not respond to tadpole losses, suggesting a potential   for facilitation between tadpoles and some insects; differential   responses among taxa resulted in the lack of a response by insect   grazers as a whole.   5. Our results suggest that before massive population declines, tadpoles   exerted strong top-down control on algal production and interacted in a   variety of ways with other primary consumers.   6. As amphibian populations continue to decline around the globe,   changes in the structure and function of freshwater habitats should be   expected. Although our study was focused on tropical headwater streams,   our results suggest that these losses of consumer diversity could   influence other aquatic systems as well and may even reach to adjacent   terrestrial environments.",1493,YES,SL,yes,,

This impact was evaluated by analyzing species richness, vegetation   structure, carbon sequestration and above ground biomass. We hypothesize   that: (a) plant (tree and herbs) species richness is negatively   correlated to management intensity and (b) vegetational density   predictably change with management intensity. Our results show that   management as practiced in traditional cocoa forest gardens in southern   Cameroon following a gradient of intensification from extensive cocoa   forest gardens with high floristic diversity to intensive ones strongly   impacts plant diversity, plant biomass and to some extend carbon storage   with possible negative consequences on biodiversity. Great differences   in species richness, species composition, and, for trees, diameter at   breast height and basal area were evident among the five types of   traditional cocoa forest garden systems investigated. In terms of plant   species richness, we found a decreasing gradient of plant species   numbers from extensive forest gardens to intensive ones. This study also   highlights the importance of the Management Index for quantifying   differences in the management; this index could be used to standardize   certification procedures and assess conservation progress and success.   Our findings support the idea that traditional cocoa forest gardens can   help to protect many forest species, sustains smallholder production and   offer more scope for conservation of biodiversity, at both species-level   and landscape-level. Moreover, diverse traditional cocoa forest gardens   may help in regulating pests and diseases and allow for efficient   adaptation to changing socioeconomic conditions.",1494,NO,SL,,,

However, many studies pool disease   prevalence into taxonomic groups, disregarding host-species composition   when comparing sites or assessing environmental impacts on patterns of   disease presence. We used simulated data under a known environmental   effect to assess the ability of standard statistical methods (binomial   and linear regression, ANOVA) to detect a significant environmental   effect on pooled disease prevalence with varying species abundance   distributions and relative susceptibilities to disease. When one species   was more susceptible to a disease and both species only partially   overlapped in their distributions, models tended to produce a greater   number of false positives (Type I error). Differences in disease risk   between regions or along an environmental gradient tended to be   underestimated, or, even in the wrong direction, when highly susceptible   taxa had reduced abundances in impacted sites, a situation likely to be   common in nature. Including relative abundance as an additional variable   in regressions improved model accuracy, but tended to be conservative,   producing more false negatives (Type II error) when species abundance   was strongly correlated with the environmental effect.

It can be considered as the   spatial manifestation of deforestation and degradation in a landscape.   Forest fragmentation thus results in the same loss of ecosystem services   as these other forms of land-cover change, but how does it affect   livelihoods? We propose here an analysis of the livelihood impacts of   tropical forest fragmentation, which will begin with a better definition   of the spatial processes involved in fragmentation. As it is difficult   to analyse the impacts of fragmentation without consideration of the   associated impacts of the causes-or drivers-of forest fragmentation, we   will analyse them in detail. Fragmentation results from a range of   drivers that are categorized into five groups: (i) economic factors;   (ii) governance factors; (iii) demographic factors; (iv) technological   factors; and (v) cultural factors. Economic factors are prevalent in   decisions, with forest conservation often being a luxury for wealthy   people. Stakeholders who gain direct economic returns from deforestation   - from logging, farming and facilitated access to markets - will also   benefit globally from forest fragmentation, the benefits from these   drivers by far outweighing the loss of ecosystem services. However,   forest dwellers and isolated forest communities will often have to   choose between `modern' life or the cultural specificities that shaped   their identity.

In this paper we present the first   comprehensive synthesis of climate-change impacts on all forested   ecosystems of Alaska, highlighting changes in the most critical   biophysical factors of each region. We developed a conceptual framework   describing climate drivers, biophysical factors and types of change to   illustrate how the biophysical and social subsystems of Alaskan forests   interact and respond directly and indirectly to a changing climate. We   then identify the regional and global implications to the climate system   and associated socio-economic impacts, as presented in the current   literature. Projections of temperature and precipitation suggest   wildfire will continue to be the dominant biophysical factor in the   Interior-boreal forest, leading to shifts from conifer-to   deciduous-dominated forests. Based on existing research, projected   increases in temperature in the Southcentral- and Kenai-boreal forests   will likely increase the frequency and severity of insect outbreaks and   associated wildfires, and increase the probability of establishment by   invasive plant species. In the Coastal-temperate forest region snow and   ice is regarded as the dominant biophysical factor. With continued   warming, hydrologic changes related to more rapidly melting glaciers and   rising elevation of the winter snowline will alter discharge in many   rivers, which will have important consequences for terrestrial and   marine ecosystem productivity. These climate-related changes will affect   plant species distribution and wildlife habitat, which have regional   societal consequences, and trace-gas emissions and radiation budgets,   which are globally important. Our conceptual framework facilitates   assessment of current and future consequences of a changing climate,   emphasizes regional differences in biophysical factors, and points to   linkages that may exist but that currently lack supporting research.

It has now been widely acknowledged that   climate change will affect biological invasions. A large number of   studies have investigated predicted shifts and other changes in the   geographic ranges of invasive alien species related to climate change   using modeling approaches. Yet these studies have provided contradictory   evidence, and no consensus has been reached. We conducted a systematic   review of 423 modeling case studies included in 71 publications that   have examined the predicted effects of climate change on those species.   We differentiate the approaches used in these studies and synthesize   their main results. Our results reaffirm the major role of climate   change as a driver of invasive alien species distribution in the future.   We found biases in the literature both regarding the taxa, toward plants   and invertebrates, and the areas of the planet investigated. Despite   these biases, we found for the plants and vertebrates studied that   climate change will more frequently contribute to a decrease in species   range size than an increase in the overall area occupied. This is   largely due to oceans preventing terrestrial invaders from spreading   poleward. In contrast, we found that the ranges of invertebrates and   pathogens studied are more likely to increase following climate change.   An important caveat to these findings is that researchers have rarely   considered the effects of climate change on transport, introduction   success, or the resulting impacts. We recommend closing these research   gaps, and propose additional avenues for future investigations, as well   as opportunities and challenges for managing invasions under climate   change.",1498,NO,SL,,,

Its invasion in the northeastern US has led to widespread forest   defoliation, wildlife disruption and even a change in biogeochemical   conditions over the area of 10(6) km(2). Spread of gypsy moth has a few   distinct features such as a patchy spatial distribution of the gypsy   moth population, which is largely uncorrelated to the environmental   heterogeneity, and a high variability (almost over an order of   magnitude) in the spread rates. These features are usually explained by   human-assisted dispersal, e.g. when masses of gypsy moth eggs are   inadvertently transported by cars and vehicles. This theory, however,   somewhat disagrees with the existence of the strong Allee effect that   tends to wipe out small new colonies. In this paper, we suggest an   alternative explanation that the patchy structure can result from the   interplay between two natural factors such as wind dispersal and viral   infection. In order to check this hypothesis, we describe the gypsy moth   spread with a diffusive SI model and study its properties by means of   extensive computer simulations. Interestingly, in a certain parameter   range our model shows formation of spatial patterns that are   qualitatively similar to those observed in the field. To find out the   relevant parameter range, we make a careful review of available   literature sources. For biologically meaningful parameter values, we   then show that the rates of gypsy moth spread predicted by our model are   in good agreement with the lower band of the rates observed in nature.

The increasing prevalence of disease on reefs may be due to   changes in the virulence of pathogens and/or to decreases in host   resistance as a result of changing environmental conditions. Coral reef   ecosystems typically thrive in oligotrophic waters; however, runoff of   fertilizers or sewage that contains elevated concentrations of nutrients   can lead to eutrophic conditions. Aplysina cauliformis is a dominant   member of the Caribbean sponge community, and is susceptible to Aplysina   Red Band Syndrome (ARBS), a disease that causes reduced sponge growth   and survival. We assessed the independent and interacting effects of   nutrient enrichment and disease on A. cauliformis, using a factorial   field experiment in which healthy and diseased sponges were exposed to   nutrient-enriched or non-enriched treatments. Impacts on ARBS virulence   (rate of lesion growth) and host response (both sponge and   cyanobacterial symbiont growth and physiology) were assessed. ARBS   lesions increased rapidly regardless of nutrient treatment, and disease   had a significantly greater detrimental impact on sponges than did   nutrient enrichment, as evidenced by a decline in sponge mass and   reduced total protein content. The sponge-cyano bacterial symbiont   relationship was less impacted by disease, although the   sponge-associated bacterial community was significantly affected by   sponge condition, with healthy sponges and diseased tissue hosting   significantly different bacterial assemblages. In contrast, nutrient   enrichment had no effects on sponge or symbiont physiology.

Here, we report on the indirect influence of a pulsed   resource, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seed production, on nest survival   in a migratory songbird. We hypothesized that seed production in year t   would determine daily nest survival rate in year t+1 through its effects   on seed-eating rodents. We used the density of sugar maple seedlings   (with cotyledons) in year t+1 as a proxy for seed production in year t   and predicted that it would be inversely related to songbird nest   survival the same year. We estimated the density of sugar maple   seedlings, eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) activity, and daily nest   survival rate in the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) over four successive   years in a northern hardwood forest of New Brunswick, Canada. Seedling   density varied by two orders of magnitude between years, whereas an   index of chipmunk activity changed by an order of magnitude. Both   variables were positively correlated and negatively correlated to daily   nest survival rate. A logistic-exposure model including only seedling   density received the greatest level of support (lowest AIC(c)). Previous   studies have reported the effect of sugar maple masting on seed-eating   rodent populations, but the strong link we report between seedling   density and songbird nest survival is novel. A nocturnal seed-eating   nest predator, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), was not considered   in our models, which may explain why chipmunk was not the best predictor   of daily nest survival rate.

Juveniles originating from both   grounds are believed to mix during migration and/or in feeding areas in   the Scotia Sea. Previous efforts to distinguish stocks in this area have   yielded contradictory results between genetics and otolith microchemical   analyses. In the present work we revisited the null hypothesis of a   single stock occurring in the broader SWA-SEP region by comparing and   integrating results from different approaches: trace metals (Ca, Sr, Ba,   Mg, Mn) and stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta O-18) in otolith cores,   and parasite assemblage compositions in adults from SWA and SEP spawning   grounds. We found significant differences in Sr:Ca, delta C-13 and delta   O-18 mean ratios between spawning grounds. The best trace element   discriminant model classified 83\% of the samples. Each stable isotope   discriminated >90\% of the samples, while combining them into a   bivariate discriminant model led to 100\% classification success. Higher   delta O-18 levels in the SWA samples agreed with lower mean temperature   and higher ambient delta O-18 levels in that area.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are an important component   of grassland ecosystems affecting the biodiversity and productivity of   plant communities, but little is known about their long-term response to   past agricultural management after the abandonment of fields. The aim of   this study was to compare the infectivity and composition of the AMF   communities of a former field, abandoned 25 years ago, and a neighboring   non-disturbed grassland, and to assess whether the composition of   intraradical AMF communities can be linked to the inability of some   plant species to colonize the abandoned field. AMF infectivity and   diversity were evaluated in soil and root samples of 12 plant species   differing in their ability to colonize abandoned fields. The abandoned   field hosted the same pool of AMF taxa as the undisturbed grassland but   the community of AMF colonized plant roots faster from a lower number of   infective propagules in the abandoned field than in the grassland. The   composition of intraradical AMF communities was affected by the biotope   and the plant species, but was unrelated to the ability of the plant   species to colonize the abandoned field. It is therefore concluded that   plants and AMF have colonized the abandoned field independently and that   differences between the AMF communities of the two biotopes reflect   persisting differences in soil characteristics.

Our results indicate   that the oviposition behaviour of adults, development of progeny and   function of soldier larvae differ greatly between C. bakeri and C.   floridanum.

N:P ratio in   fig-pollinating wasp displayed linear functions to fig N contents,   suggesting that N limitation in fig wasps may dominate the nutritional   relationship between fig pollinator and its host. Fig wasp population   size had significant influences on N concentrations in host fig and   female wasp per se. Driven by the nutritional stress of pollinating and   parasite insects, fig fruit preferred increasing its diameter first but   not nutrient richness. Values for N and P contents of fig pollinators   showed seasonal differences with greater N:P ratios in dry season than   in rainy season. The observations suggest that tropical climate change   would result in more severe N limitation to fig-pollinating wasp and may   further influence the stability of fig fig wasp mutualism.",1506,NO,SL,,,

Pathogen-suppressive soil bacteria have the potential   to influence plant community composition and diversity, but remain   relatively unexplored in tropical forest soils. To estimate the   potential for disease suppression among Streptomyces communities in   tropical dry forests, we cultured soil-borne Streptomyces from plots in   two forests in northwestern Costa Rica (Santa Rosa and Palo Verde) and   quantified antibiotic-mediated pathogen inhibition against three plant   pathogens. The potential for pathogen inhibition and disease suppression   by Streptomyces was highly variable across the landscape. Densities of   pathogen-suppressive Streptomyces varied by over ten-fold and were   correlated with soil nutrients across the plots. In particular,   Streptomyces communities became more pathogen-suppressive as labile soil   P decreased. Inhibitor densities were significantly higher in Santa Rosa   than Palo Verde, which may be related to differences in soil texture   and/or plant community composition between the two forests. Our findings   suggest potential differences in the degree and specificity of   antibiotic-mediated disease suppression in tropical dry forest soils of   Costa Rica, and highlight the need for further studies on the drivers of   pathogen-suppressive phenotypes as well as the consequences of spatially   variable pathogen inhibition for plant community composition in tropical   forest ecosystems.   Resumen Las bacterias del genero Streptomyces son ubicuas en el suelo y   son conocidas por su capacidad de producir diversos metabolitos   secundarios. Estos incluyen antibioticos que pueden inhibir   fitopatogenos del suelo y disminuir enfermedades. Las bacterias que   suprimen el crecimiento de patogenos pueden influir en la composicion y   la diversidad de comunidades de plantas, pero han sido poco estudiadas   en suelos de bosques tropicales. Para estimar el potencial de supresion   de enfermedades de diferentes comunidades de Streptomyces en el bosque   tropical seco, cultivamos Streptomyces de muestras de suelo colectadas   en parcelas en dos bosques en la region Noroeste de Costa Rica, y   cuantificamos la frecuencia e intensidad de inhibicion de tres patogenos   vegetales. El potencial de inhibicion de patogenos y supresion de   enfermedad de Streptomyces fue muy variable entre sitios. Las densidades   de Streptomyces supresoras de patogenos variaron mas de diez veces y se   observo una correlacion entre la densidad de bacterias y la   concentracion de nutrientes en el suelo de las parcelas.   Especificamente, hubo mayor supresion de patogenos en suelos con bajas   concentraciones de fosforo labil. Las densidades de inhibidores fueron   significativamente mayores en Santa Rosa que en Palo Verde, lo que puede   estar relacionado con las diferencias en la textura del suelo y/o   diferencias en la composicion de las comunidades vegetales entre los dos   sitios. Nuestros resultados sugieren que existen diferencias en el grado   y la especificidad de la supresion de enfermedades mediada por   antibioticos en suelos del bosque tropical seco de Costa Rica, y   resaltan la necesidad de mas estudios acerca de los factores que   influyen en la presencia de diferentes fenotipos supresores de   patogenos, asi como las consecuencias de la variacion espacial de la   inhibicion de patogenos para la composicion de las comunidades vegetales   en ecosistemas de bosques tropicales.",1507,no,SL,,,

Furthermore, such species are typically among the last in a   community to reestablish due to their reliance upon lower trophic level   resources and a requirement for persistent, stable ecological   conditions. Consequently their presence alone can be indicative of   healthy ecosystems. Using replicated, quantitative food webs we studied   the impacts of a restoration treatment upon the interactions of a   tri-trophic community consisting of plants, their bumble bee   pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble   bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the   community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites.   However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism,   prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran   parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in   restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete   reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources   due to differences in. oral species composition, and the reduced ability   of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other   natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the   incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to   significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how   vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to   ancient, control networks.",1508,MAYBE,SL,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

We conducted   surveys of I. ricinus ticks on ground vegetation using cloth lure   transects and counts of ticks biting lambs on spring pastures, where   lambs are exposed to infection with Anaplasma phagocytophllurn, the   causative agent of tick-borne fever in livestock. Pastures had higher   densities of I. ricinus ticks on the ground vegetation and more ticks   biting lambs if there was more tree cover in or adjacent to pastures.   Importantly, there was a close correlation between questing tick density   on pastures and counts of ticks biting lambs on the same pasture,   indicating that cloth lure transects are a good proxy of risk to   livestock of tick exposure and tick-borne disease.

Key   questions remain about how animal grazing, liming (e.g., the addition of   CaCO3 to soils), and nutrient fertilization might affect, in the   long-term, soil nutrient cycling and multiple root traits. Here we focus   on a mesotrophic grassland located in Berkshire, UK, where contrasting   levels of rabbit grazing, liming, and different inorganic fertilizers   have been applied since 1991. We ask how (1) soil nitrogen (N)   availability and cycling, (2) total root mass, (3) root mass   decomposition, and (4) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) root   colonization might respond to 22 years of very different management. We   found that liming strongly affected total root mass, root decomposition,   root AMF colonization as well as soil N availability and cycling and   that these effects were mainly driven by liming-induced increases in   soil pH. Increases in soil pH were associated with significant (1)   decreases in root mass, (2) increases in root mass decomposability and   in the mineralization of N in decomposing root detritus, and (3)   increases in AMF infection. Soil pH was also significantly related to   greater N availability (i.e., soil NO3 levels) and to lower delta N-15   natural abundance, which suggests more efficient N uptake by plants in   limed soils as we found in our study. The application of multiple   nutrients (N, P, K, Mg) also reduced total root mass, while N-only   fertilization was associated with greater AMF infection. Surprisingly   the long-term impact of grazing was generally weak and not significant   on most plant and soil parameters. Despite soil pH affecting most   belowground variables, changes in soil pH were not associated with any   change in soil C and N stocks. Because liming can improve nutrient   cycling (and benefits soil pH and grass yields) without negatively   affecting soil C sequestration, we suggest that regular liming   applications may provide management solutions for increasing the   long-term sustainability of permanent grassland.",1510,NO,SL,,,

Exotic fast-growing trees have   been largely planted but their use is currently controversial because of   their potential negative ecological impacts. Whereas the positive impact   of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal inoculation in nursery was   demonstrated, few studies focused on the monitoring of mycorrhizal   inoculation in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. In addition, the majority   of studies are based on single-species inocula with non native AM fungal   strains. The current study aims at evaluating the efficiency of   mycorrhizal inoculation of the emblematic Mediterranean carob tree   (Ceratonia siliqua) in a Moroccan degraded site, through an ecological   engineering strategy based on the use of a complex native AM community   (naturally associated to carob trees). Results demonstrate the high   potential of this approach by improving sustainably the growth and   nutrient status of carob trees in a 3-year-old plantation and also by   inducing a positive soil microbial environment for nutrient cycling and   environmental stress resistance.

All plants assigned to waterlogging   treatment started to wither and lose their root vitality, and   consequently lost considerable photosynthesizing and root tissues.   However, E+ plants showed significantly less symptoms of damage, and   they produced significantly greater content of chlorophyll, more   tillers, higher shoots and higher under-ground biomass compared to E-   plants. Waterlogging induced osmoprotective proline production   particularly in E+ plants and had lower malondialdehyde content and   electrolyte leakage, suggesting that endophyte infection positively   affects osmotic potential and oxidative balance of the host plant.

Environmental   data indicate that Lake Biwa had experienced eutrophication (according   to the total phosphorus concentration) in the late 1960s and recovered   to a normal trophic status around 1985, and then has exhibited warming   since 1990. Total zooplankton abundance showed a significant correlation   with total phytoplankton biomass. Following a classic pattern, the   cladoceran/calanoid and cyclopoid/calanoid abundance ratio was related   positively to eutrophication. The zooplankton community exhibited a   significant response to the boom and bust of phytoplankton biomass as a   consequence of eutrophication-reoligotriphication and warming. Moreover,   our analyses suggest that the Lake Biwa ecosystem exhibited a   hierarchical response across trophic levels; that is, higher trophic   levels may show a more delayed response or no response to eutrophication   than lower ones.   We tested the hypothesis that the phytoplankton community can better   explain the variation of the zooplankton community than bulk   environmental variables, considering that the phytoplankton community   may directly affect the zooplankton succession through predator-prey   interactions.

A fourth parasitoid (Cephalonomia hyalinipennis) is added to the   system.   3. Interspecific competitive interactions among parasitoids (e.g.,   dyadic contests, intra-guild predation and hyperparasitism) and their   effects on the control of CBB are explored.   Because field data on the effectiveness of the parasitoids on CBB   control is sparse, we assessed the efficacy of the parasitoids for   control of CBB heuristically.

Control of CBB by betilid parasitoids (Cephalonomia stephanoderis,   Cephalonomia hyalinipennis and Prorops nasuta) is ineffective because of   their low reproductive capacity relative to CBB, their host-feeding   behavior, and phenological mismatches with CBB life stages.   2.

Several hypotheses of the causes of these abnormalities have   been proposed and examined by multiple research organizations over the   past three decades. Initially, organochlorine pesticide (OCP)   contamination was considered the most likely factor causing poor   reproductive success. DDE concentrations in alligator eggs sampled in   1984-1985 were approximately 4 mg/kg and toxaphene concentrations were   approximately 2.5 mg/kg. These levels were known to cause reproductive   failure in certain birds. However, transmissible diseases, population   age and density, cyanotoxins, nutritional deficiencies, and combinations   thereof, were also investigated for their contribution to poor alligator   reproductive success. Investigations of an alligator mortality and   reproductive failure event on Lake Griffin, a lake similar to Lake   Apopka but with lower OCP levels, revealed analogous reproductive   abnormalities that were associated with a dietary thiamine deficiency.   Thiamine deficiency appeared to be associated with a diet of almost   exclusively gizzard shad, which contain thiaminase, an enzyme that   breaks down thiamine. OCP contaminants may contribute to these maladies,   perhaps through endocrine disruption and increased stress.

Host-pathogen relationships are well suited to a dynamical analysis   of the effects of climate change due to the direct linkages between   pathogen behaviour and abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall.   3. Seedlings of the palm Iriartea deltoidea experience significant   mortality due to infection by the fungus Diplodia mutila.

Cyanophages, viruses infecting cyanobacteria, are a   major force in the ecology of their hosts. These phages contribute   greatly to cyanobacterial mortality, therefore acting as a powerful   selective force upon their hosts. Phage reproduction is based on   utilization of the host transcription and translation mechanisms;   therefore, differences in the G+C genomic content between cyanophages   and their hosts could be a limiting factor for the translation of   cyanophage genes. On the basis of comprehensive genomic analyses   conducted in this study, we suggest that cyanophages of the Myoviridae   family, which can infect both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus,   overcome this limitation by carrying additional sets of tRNAs in their   genomes accommodating AT-rich codons.

As bacteria become the main energy pathway to the consumers,   the system takes a more web-like structure through increased omnivory,   and may thereby facilitate the system's persistence to the cyanobacteria   outbreak. We also showed how the killing of cyanobacteria host cells by   chytrids had important impact on the food web dynamics by facilitating   grazing on the cyanobacteria, and by offering alternative pathways to   the consumers.

We performed PCA and cluster analyses to determine   vegetation structure and similarity, and to investigate how relevant   vegetation variables are associated with parasitological parameters. All   haemosporidian infections in chestnut-capped brush finches belonged to   Haemoproteus and Plasmodium species. Prevalence and parasitaemia of   avian malaria were higher during the rainy season, while aggregation   remained similar. Both prevalence and parasitaemia were higher in the   urban forest. Prevalence was lower in the well-preserved cloud forest   during the dry season. Parasitaemia was negatively associated to bush   cover. Our results suggest that an increase in land use intensity   reduces seasonal fluctuations in parasite transmission, and that   infections are more frequent and more severe for birdsinhabiting urban   environments.

Outbreak of hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelgies tsugae - HWA, is causing   selective removal of eastern hemlock Tsuga canadensis at a regional   scale. Impacts of outbreak-caused canopy mortality and shifts in   dominant species on litter decay were compared across sites that range   in HWA-caused canopy damage and subsequent canopy dominance by black   birch Betula lenta. Senescent litter from eastern hemlock, black birch,   and equal litter mixes were decomposed in the field for 36 months within   nine sites in Connecticut and Massachusetts USA. Mass loss and \% N   accumulation of black birch was 65\% and 52\% greater compared to   eastern hemlock. In contrast, outbreak related canopy damage increased   litter mass loss by 11.5\% in high mortality stands relative to   uninfested stands but canopy damage had no impact on \% N dynamics.   Non-additive effects of litter mixing influenced chemical dynamics of   decaying litter; black birch accumulated less N and eastern hemlock   accumulated more N compared to each species decaying alone. However,   these changes offset and mixed litter bags overall showed no differences   in N dynamics compared to values from each species decaying alone. In   eastern hemlock stands invaded by hemlock woolly adelgid, canopy damage   influences the rates and dynamics of decay but species differences   between hemlock and black birch leaf litter are the dominant mechanisms   of decomposition changes and a long-lasting driver of increased N   cycling rates. Species shifts may be the dominant driver of altered   ecosystem processes for other insect outbreaks, particularly when   replacement species have very different characteristics regulating   decomposition and N cycling.",1523,YES,SL,no,no data on PP,

In this study, we investigated how disturbance and   biotic interactions with pathogens and microbial symbionts mediate   invasion of American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) in early-and   late-successional coastal dune habitats. First, we tested the effect of   disturbance on biomasses of two exotic beachgrass species (the invading   A. breviligulata and the established A. arenaria) and a native   beachgrass (Elymus mollis) by growing plants with and without a   disturbance manipulation in early-and late-successional habitats. We   quantified root colonization by fungal symbionts and infection by   plant-parasitic nematodes to determine the effect of potential   mutualists and pathogens on plant biomass. Second, we tested whether   soil microbes associated with the established A. arenaria mediated A.   breviligulata invasion by inoculating potted plants with microbes from   early-and late-successional habitat. We found no effect of disturbance   on biomass of the invading A. breviligulata or native E. mollis, whereas   A. arenaria biomass increased when grown with disturbance. Colonization   by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and by fungal endophytes were poor   predictors of plant biomass, and plant-parasitic nematodes were   infrequently observed. Microbe addition increased belowground biomass of   A. breviligulata, but not A. arenaria, compared to control treatments.   Overall, our results suggest that A. breviligulata invasion in both the   early-and late-successional habitat is mediated by its lack of   disturbance dependence and positive effects of soil microbes.

However, the suite of   prey species available to a predator is often spatially and temporally   variable. As a result, species-specific selectivity data are of limited   use for predicting novel predator-prey interactions because they are   assemblage specific. We present a method for predicting diet selection   that is applicable across prey assemblages, based on identifying general   morphological and behavioural traits of prey that confer vulnerability   to predation independent of species identity. We apply this trait-based   approach to examining prey selection by Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois   volitans and Pterois miles), invasive predators that prey upon   species-rich reef fish communities and are rapidly spreading across the   western Atlantic. We first generate hypotheses about morphological and   behavioural traits recurring across fish species that could facilitate   or deter predation by lionfish. Constructing generalized linear   mixed-effects models that account for relatedness among prey taxa, we   test whether these traits predict patterns of diet selection by lionfish   within two independent data sets collected at different spatial scales:   (i) in situ visual observations of prey consumption and availability for   individual lionfish and (ii) comparisons of prey abundance in lionfish   stomach contents to availability on invaded reefs at large. Both   analyses reveal that a number of traits predicted to affect   vulnerability to predation, including body size, body shape, position in   the water column and aggregation behaviour, are important determinants   of diet selection by lionfish. Small, shallow-bodied, solitary fishes   found resting on or just above reefs are the most vulnerable. Fishes   that exhibit parasite cleaning behaviour experience a significantly   lower risk of predation than non-cleaning fishes, and fishes that are   nocturnally active are at significantly greater risk. Together,   vulnerable traits heighten the risk of predation by a factor of nearly   200. Our study reveals that a trait-based approach yields insights into   predator-prey interactions that are robust across prey assemblages.   Importantly, in situ observations of selection yield similar results to   broadscale comparisons of prey use and availability, which are more   typically gathered for predator species. A trait-based approach could   therefore be of use across predator species and ecosystems to predict   the outcomes of changing predator-prey interactions on community   dynamics.",1528,NO,SL,,,

Here we focus on   monitoring ``within-state,'' gradual changes in vegetation in contrast   with traditional monitoring of ``abrupt'' land-cover conversions.   Gradual changes result from a variety of processes, such as vegetation   growth and succession, damage from insects and disease, responses to   shifts in climate, and other factors. Despite the prevalence of gradual   changes across the landscape, they are largely ignored by the remote   sensing community. Gradual changes are best characterized and monitored   using time-series analysis, and with the successful launch of Landsat 8   we now have appreciable data continuity that extends the Landsat legacy   across the previous 43 years. In this study, we conducted three related   analyses: (1) comparison of spectral values acquired by Landsats 7 and   8, separated by eight days, to ensure compatibility for time-series   evaluation; (2) tracking of multitemporal signatures for different   change processes across Landsat 5, 7, and 8 sensors using   anniversary-date imagery; and (3) tracking the same type of processes   using all available acquisitions. In this investigation, we found that   data representing natural vegetation from Landsats 5, 7, and 8 were   comparable and did not indicate a need for major modification prior to   use for long-term monitoring. Analyses using- anniversary-date imagery   can be very effective for assessing long term patterns and trends   occurring across the landscape, and are especially good for providing   insights regarding trends related to long-term and continuous trends of   growth or decline. We found that use of all available data provided a   much more comprehensive level of understanding of the trends occurring,   providing information about rate, duration, and intra- and inter-annual   variability that could not be readily gleaned from the anniversary date   analyses. We observed that using all available clear Landsat 5-8   observations with the new Continuous Change Detection and Classification   (CCDC) algorithm was very effective for illuminating vegetation trends.   There are a number of potential challenges for assessing gradual   changes, including atmospheric impacts, algorithm development and   visualization of the changes. One of the biggest challenges for studying   gradual change will be the lack of appropriate data for validating   results and products. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.",1529,NO,SL,,,

This has increased   transmission of UVB radiation to the surface, and been implicated in a   range of negative human and ecosystem health impacts.   Midpoint-level LCA has traditionally utilised the steady-state Ozone   Depletion Potential factors that are prominent in policy making. Current   ozone-depletion endpoint models incorporate skin cancer, cataract   damages, and certain changes in ecosystem productivity caused by excess   UVB exposure. Other health, ecosystem and agri-production impacts are   still to be incorporated into the LCA framework.   As the ozone layer recovers following regulated halocarbon emission   reductions, scientific attention turns to the question of longer term   ozone layer management. While growing anthropogenic emissions of N2O   (nitrous oxide) might pose a threat to ozone layer recovery, the   mitigating effects of CH4 (methane) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions   will more than compensate for this. Global stratospheric ozone is   expected to exceed pre-industrial levels sometime this century, albeit   with a very different spatial distribution. Predictions are that UVB   levels will remain elevated in the tropics, but become depressed in   other regions. That latter situation might increase the incidence of   diseases associated with insufficient UVB exposure.   Whatever the policy response to these new challenges, it seems the   interface of ozone layer science and management will become increasingly   complex. It may be that the metrics used for ozone layer analysis will   also need to evolve, if LCA is to remain relevant to this new management   paradigm.",1530,NO,SL,,,

In this study, we investigated the   responses of major soil biological traits to both the short- and   long-term effects of pesticide inputs in golf turfgrass. Overall, golf   course fairways receiving regular, high-rate pesticide inputs exhibited   suppression in soil biological traits involved in litter   decomposition/nutrient mineralization (decomposer arthropod abundance   and acid phosphatase activity), and plant nutrient uptake/plant   protection (mycorrhizal fungi). In contrast, most beneficial soil biota   appeared to tolerate a low level of pesticide input. In a short-term   manipulative experiment we observed that monthly applications of   chlorothalonil and a single application of imidacloprid, both at a   medium label rate, consistently suppressed decomposer microarthropods   over a 4-month period. The imidacloprid application also reduced the   total infection of mycorrhizae and dark septate endophytes in roots.   These results suggest that the use of pesticides as a whole does not   always result in negative impacts on soil biota, but rather that the   pesticide effects vary among functional groups of soil biota and are   contingent upon long-term patterns of pesticide input intensity, and   short-term differences in active ingredient and application program   (application rate and frequency).

Several   hypotheses have been generated to explain the success of exotic plants   in their new ranges, with escape from their old natural enemies, such as   pathogens and herbivores (the `enemy release hypothesis') and novel   defensive chemistry (the `novel weapons hypothesis') receiving   considerable attention. Thus far, virtually all studies of exotic plants   and insects have been conducted in a strictly bi-trophic framework   involving plants and herbivores. On the other hand, it has been argued   that a better understanding of the forces regulating community structure   and function should include natural enemies of the herbivores.   Furthermore, indirect interactions between organisms in the plant roots   (below-ground) and shoots (above-ground) are known to strongly effect   the behaviour and performance of consumers in the opposite   `compartment'. Here, we discuss a range of physiological, evolutionary   and ecological aspects of plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions   involving exotic plants. Further, interactions between soil and   above-ground organisms are explored with respect to studies with exotic   plants. We argue that it is important to link population and community   ecology to individual-level variation in the physiology and behaviour of   insects across several trophic levels in studies with invasive plants.   Future research with invaders should also aim to integrate physically   separated compartments (e.g, plant roots and shoots). This will   facilitate a more complete understanding of the factors underlying the   success (or failure) of exotic plants to spread and become dominant in   their new ranges. Moreover, these data will also help to unravel the   relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes in regulating   communities in which exotic plants have become established.

Crop development monitoring, leaf scale measurements and   continuous eddy-covariance measurements were conducted in a production   crop at the Lonzee experimental site in Belgium. The 3 years were   characterised by similar soil proprieties (same site), similar   management (sowing, harvesting, plant protection and nitrogen   application, adhering to regional standards), and the use of recommended   cultivars (the most productive ones for this region).   The comparison of carbon fluxes, growth and productivity in the three   growing seasons highlighted mechanisms affected by meteorological   conditions and, in some cases, modulated by a cultivar effect. In   particular, it was shown that (a) precociousness or lateness in stage   development was triggered mainly by cumulated temperature during winter   and early spring; (b) early development in one season could explain the   larger ecosystem net carbon sequestration that year, but had no impact   on grain yield; (c) low grain yield in one season was the result of a   complex mechanism including drought in early spring, which hindered flag   leaf development, and moist conditions in late spring, which restrained   radiation and favoured the development of fungal diseases.   In all cases, it was found that grain yield could not be related to   gross primary productivity or net ecosystem exchange, suggesting that   reallocation and translocation processes play a substantial role in   grain filling.

Plant diversity reduces among-plant competition, and as a   result, may have cascading bottom-up effects through altered resource   quantity and quality. Less understood are parallel effects of resource   heterogeneity on consumer foraging behaviors, and the consequences of   such effects for trophic interactions and feedbacks on plant   performance. Here, we asked whether genotypic diversity in the herb   Ruellia nudiflora influences seed predator (SP) and parasitoid   functional responses, and if such effects in turn influence selection on   the plant. We established plots with plants of one or five genetic   families (pool = 14) and measured fruit, seed predator, and parasitoid   abundance. By eliminating direct plant-plant interactions, this   experiment explicitly tested for plant diversity effects occurring   through altered consumer behaviors (vs. effects through changes in plant   quantity or quality). We compared observed plant fitness (under three   trophic levels) to projected fitness in the absence of parasitoids (two   trophic levels) and in the absence of seed predation (one trophic level)   by computing the number of seeds consumed by the SP and the number of   seeds rescued from consumption by parasitoids. We then compared the   strength and mode of selection on fruit number between levels of   diversity, separately under each trophic scenario. Plant diversity did   not influence fruit, seed predator, or parasitoid abundance, but did   alter plant-SP interactions. SP recruitment resembled a Type II   functional response but saturated weakly in polycultures, with fewer SPs   at intermediate fruit abundance and more SPs at high fruit abundance   relative to monoculture. Parasitoid recruitment was weakly positively   density dependent and unaffected by diversity. Importantly, we found   that under the bi-trophic scenario, the effect of diversity on SP   recruitment altered the mode of selection on fruit number, from   directional selection at low diversity to nonlinear (stabilizing)   selection at high diversity. In contrast, diversity did not alter   selection under mono- or tri-trophic scenarios. Therefore, diversity   effects on SP functional responses fed back to alter selection on fruit   number, but parasitoids eliminated this linkage by weakening herbivore   selection. Collectively, these findings provide novel evidence for the   mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks between plant diversity   and consumers.",1534,NO,SL,,,

Habitat modification can have   significant effects on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and   interactions between species by altering species abundances or the   available resources in an ecosystem. Increasing complexity within   modified habitats has the potential to maintain biodiversity and   preserve species interactions. We investigated trophic interactions   between Argyrodes miniaceus, a cleptoparasitic spider, and its Nephila   spp. spider hosts in mature oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia.   A. miniaceus co-occupy the webs of Nephila spp. females and survive by   stealing prey items caught in the web.

Experimental   understory treatments included enhanced complexity, standard complexity,   and reduced complexity understory vegetation, which had been established   as part of the ongoing Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical   Agriculture (BEFTA) Project.

Methods   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to assess   metabolic fingerprints of leaf samples of 10 individuals of each species   from either monocultures or mixtures.

Recently, this paradigm has shifted   to include top-down control as an additional primary factor regulating   salt-marsh community structure. The most recent research on consumer   impacts in southern US marshes has shown that top-down forces often   interact with biotic and abiotic factors, such as secondary fungal   infection in grazer-induced wounds, soil nutrients and climatic   variation, to influence ecosystem structure. In a more northern salt   marsh, located in New England, we examined the separate and interactive   effects of nutrient availability, insect herbivory and secondary fungal   infection, on growth of the foundation species, Spartina alterniflora.   We used a factorial design with two levels of nutrients (control and   addition) insects (control and removal) and fungi (control and removal).   Nutrient addition increased plant biomass by 131\% in the absence of   herbivores. When insect consumers were allowed access to fertilized   plots, biomass was reduced by nearly 45\% when compared with treatments   with nutrients and insecticide. In contrast, insect herbivores did not   affect plant biomass in unfertilized control treatments. These   differences suggest that consumer effects are triggered under high   nutrient levels only. We also found that secondary fungal infections in   grazer-induced wounds, in contrast to lower latitude marshes, did not   significantly impact primary production. Our results suggest that while   New England salt marshes may typically be under bottom-up control,   eutrophication can trigger dual control with inclusion of top-down   regulation. However, unlike lower latitude marshes, consumer control of   plant growth in northern US salt marshes is not dependent on herbivores   facilitating fungal infections that then control grass growth,   suggesting that the intensity of disease mediated top-down control by   small grazers may be regulated by climate and/or grazer identity that   co-vary with latitude.",1539,YES,SL,yes,,

Although high-throughput sequencing has greatly   increased the ability to quantify the diversity of fungi in   environmental samples, researchers currently lack a simple and   consistent way to sort large sequence pools into ecologically meaningful   categories. We address this issue by introducing FUNGuild, a tool that   can be used to taxonomically parse fungal OTUs by ecological guild   independent of sequencing platform or analysis pipeline. Using a   database and an accompanying bioinformatics script, we demonstrate the   application of FUNGuild to three high-throughput sequencing datasets   from different habitats: forest soils, grassland soils, and decomposing   wood. We found that guilds characteristic of each habitat (i.e.,   saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest soils, saprotrophic and   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in grassland soils, saprotrophic, wood   decomposer, and plant pathogenic fungi in decomposing wood) were each   well represented. The example datasets demonstrate that while we could   quickly and efficiently assign a large portion of the data to guilds,   another large portion could not be assigned, reflecting the need to   expand and improve the database as well as to gain a better   understanding of natural history for many described and undescribed   fungal species. As a community resource, FUNGuild is dependent on   third-party annotation, so we invite researchers to populate it with new   categories and records as well as refine those already in existence.

Here we describe for the first time the   existence of a gut morphological filter capable of protecting an animal   gut microbiome from disruption. The proventriculus, a valve located   between the crop and midgut of insects, functions as a micro-pore filter   in the Sonoran Desert turtle ant (Cephalotes rohweri), blocking the   entry of bacteria and particles >= 0.2 mu m into the midgut and hindgut   while allowing passage of dissolved nutrients. Initial establishment of   symbiotic gut bacteria occurs within the first few hours after pupation   via oral-rectal trophallaxis, before the proventricular filter develops.   Cephalotes ants are remarkable for having maintained a consistent core   gut microbiome over evolutionary time and this partner fidelity is   likely enabled by the proventricular filtering mechanism.

Five forest types were   identified, with three of these (sugar maple (Acer saccharum   Marsh.)/birch, eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L), and balsam   fir (Abies balsamea (L.)

Two forest types (white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench)   Voss),/trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), and paper birch   (Betula papyr(era Marsh.)) were in a state of transition. The long-term   (> 50 year) successional pathways of all five forest types will be   influenced by climate change, species' migration abilities, and disease.   Many dominant species currently on the island, including balsam fir,   black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns \& Poggenb.), and   white spruce, are expected to become extirpated, while the abundance of   other common species, including paper birch and trembling aspen, is   expected to decline. The 21 km distance between the mainland and the   islands will prohibit timely immigration of new species onto the island   in the face of climate change. Immigration will likely be led by   avian-dispersed species (Prunus spp., exotic Lonicera spp., and Rhamnus   cathartica, another exotic species) with dispersal of other taxa relying   on stochastic events or human transport. Managers should consider   assisted migration to ensure that species assemblages remain congruent;   otherwise, stable ecosystems dominated by a few non-native taxa may   result.

We   also analyzed the volatile organic compounds emitted by non-infested   genotypic mixtures to provide insight on a possible mechanism   influencing aphid populations. Mixtures and monocultures of wheat   emitted the same compounds, but mixtures emitted greater amounts of   volatile compounds than monocultures.

These fungi are supposedly   ubiquitous in nature, infecting plants through airborne spores. As many   foliar endophytes can also exist in soil, we hypothesized that there   would be a strong similarity between root and shoot endophytes in any   given plant species and that differences between plant species would be   greater than those between organs within a species. 2. Leaf and root   fungal endophyte communities were assessed in field-collected plants of   three co-occurring grassland forbs (Cirsium arvense, Plantago lanceolata   and Rumex acetosa) in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer). The   former two species are mycorrhizal, whilst the latter species is not so.   3. The highest fungal species richness was recorded from P. lanceolata   with R. acetosa hosting the least endophyte diversity. Endophyte   communities were more diverse in root than leaf tissues and in summer   than in winter. Similarity of endophyte communities between different   host plant species and organs within an individual host was very low.   Negative correlations were found between mycorrhizal colonization and   endophyte presence in the roots of C. arvense and P. lanceolata,   suggesting some degree of antagonism or competition between the fungi.   Consistent positive associations were found between the number of   endophyte species in roots and shoots of plants. 4. Synthesis. In   contrast to previous studies, the results show that many endophytes do   not occur ubiquitously, but instead exhibit both plant and tissue   specificity. There is a strong seasonal change in endophyte communities,   but the differences between roots and shoots at any one time can be just   as large. This dissimilarity suggests a lack of systemic growth by the   fungi from one tissue to another. Mycorrhizas may interact negatively   with other root endophytes, indicating that the latter should not be   ignored in future mycorrhizal studies. We should begin to think of   individual plants as ecosystems of interacting microbes, whose community   is structured by plant genetics and environmental conditions, coupled   with interactions between the microbes themselves.",1552,NO,SL,,,

In particular,   grasses can be commonly infected by both endophytic fungi and viruses,   which are typically transmitted by aphids. In this study, we   investigated how an aphid-transmitted viral pathogen and a symbiotic   endophytic fungus altered host growth and allocation. We hypothesized   that, by reducing aphid feeding, endophyte infection would lower viral   titre and consequently decrease the negative effects of virus infection   on host biomass production. In a greenhouse experiment, we manipulated   fungal endophyte status and virus infection (Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus -   PAV) of two tall fescue cultivars with different genetic backgrounds   [KY 31 and pasture demonstration farm (PDF)]. In one cultivar (PDF),   we also manipulated endophyte strain, using two strains that had been   selected for differences in alkaloid production. We assessed host, virus   and vector responses. As hypothesized, endophyte infection decreased   reproduction and abundance of aphid vectors; however, in contrast to our   hypothesis, this response by aphids did not impact viral titre. For both   tall fescue cultivars, endophyte infection alleviated the negative   effect of virus infection on the proportion of total plant biomass   allocated to roots. On the other hand, for the KY 31 cultivar only,   virus infection decreased tillering in endophyte-infected individuals,   but not endophyte-free individuals. Within the PDF cultivar, both   endophyte strains produced similar effects on host, virus and vector   responses. Synthesis These results indicate that some of the beneficial   effects provided by endophyte infection, particularly alleviating the   negative effect of virus infection on the proportion of total plant   biomass allocated to roots, do not arise strictly from altering host   interactions with herbivores (aphids), but also occur by changing host   responses to viral infection.

So far, knowledge of how nutrient   limitation affects parasite performance at the host population level and   how this affects the host populations is limited.   Results: We followed the population growth of Daphnia magna that were   uninfected or experimentally infected with a microsporidian, Glugoides   intestinalis. The Daphnia were fed either P-sufficient or P-limited   algae. The P-limited diet decreased the population density and biomass   compared with the populations fed with the P-sufficient algae. In the   P-sufficient populations, infection with the parasite reduced the   population density but not the biomass of Daphnia, while in the   P-limited populations, both the density and biomass of Daphnia decreased   toward the end of the 32 day experiment compared with the uninfected   controls. The infected animals from the P-limited populations had higher   parasite spore cluster counts, while, in a separate experiment, host   diet quality did not affect the number of parasites in individually kept   Daphnia.   Conclusions: Because host diet quality did not affect parasite numbers   at the individual level, we suggest that the higher parasite load in the   P-limited populations is a result of feedback effects arising at the   population level. Because of the density-dependent transmission of the   parasite and the time lag between exposure and transmission, the lower   host population density in the P-limited populations led to a higher   spore: host ratio. This effect may have been further reinforced by   decreases in filtration rates caused by crowding in the P-sufficient   populations and/or increases in filtration rates as a response to poor   food quality in the P-limited populations. The increases in exposure led   to a higher parasite load and aggravated the negative effects of   parasite infection at the population level.",1556,NO,SL,,,

Most research using network approaches to address   this challenge has focused on predator-prey interactions and static   networks. We describe a stochastic ecological network simulation model   that combines predator-prey interactions with mutualism, parasitism and   basal species competition. Network topology is based on a generalized   niche model, while temporal dynamics are specified using bioenergetic   models with noise terms. We use the model to explore the effects of   non-predator-prey interactions, color of environmental noise, and the   degree of synchronization of environmental noise across species on the   coefficients of variation of total ecosystem energy content and Shannon   entropy over time. In regression trees derived by binary recursive   partitioning, the presence or absence of synchrony gave the greatest   difference in the means of data points for both system energy and   Shannon entropy, followed in turn by white versus colored noise and pink   versus red and black noise. The effects are present despite the large   variation in the Monte Carlo simulations reflecting the variability of   real ecosystems. Non-predator-prey interactions explained relatively   small proportions of the total deviance, and each had different effect   signs depending on the presence of the other interaction types and on   whether energy or entropy was measured. These results underscore the   importance of modeling more realistic colors of environmental noise in   understanding and predicting the dynamics of food webs and ecological   communities.

This   endemic genetic diversity fosters a rapid response to environmental   change in mostly isolated local communities and, in particular, fosters   the constant adaptation of ecosystems common to humans and farmed and   wild animal populations and pathogens. During a 2-year study carried out   in several mountainous regions of North Vietnam near the Chinese border,   we surveyed 1697 breeders in 249 villages and gathered 5815 biological   samples among the four main domesticated species of food animals:   chickens, cattle, buffaloes, and goats. Serological analyses were   carried out by ELISA on 726 sera in order to assess the prevalence of   antibodies specific to two major diseases suspected to be present in the   region: avian influenza (AI) and peste des petits ruminants (PPR). The   results reported here reveal the presence of antibodies specific to AI,   but not the H5N1 highly pathogenic strain, and the presence of   antibodies specific to PPR, confirming that this disease, never   previously described in Southeast Asia, is present in this region, with   no mortality and little or no evidence of clinical cases. These are   probably situations of co-evolutive epidemiological equilibrium between   pathogen populations, which may have lost their virulence, and animal   populations that have acquired genetic resistances over generations,   either naturally or through genetic introgression from related wild   species better adapted to such pathogens.

We hypothesised that vegetation cover   would provide habitat for ground fauna. We also hypothesised that   rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) would reduce the abundance of these   fauna by reducing vegetation, and by providing prey for mammalian   predators (cats Felis catus and ferrets Mustela putorius) that Consume   ground fauna as secondary prey. We measured these variables at 30 sites   across three pastoral properties in the South Island in 1996 and 2002.   There were mostly positive relationships between vegetation ground cover   and fauna captures in pitfall traps. Relatively few beetles and   caterpillars were caught where cover was less than 80\%, no millipedes   were caught where cover was less than 70\%, and few spiders and mostly   no skinks, crickets, flies or slugs were caught where vegetation cover   was less than 50\%. Most grasshoppers were caught where cover ranged   from 30 to 80\%. Faunal species richness was also positively related to   cover. This supports our hypothesis that ground vegetation provides   habitat for skinks and invertebrates in this ecosystem. The introduction   of rabbit haemorrhagic disease in 1997 provided a natural experiment to   test the hypothesised indirect effects of rabbits oil ground fauna.   Declines in rabbits varied between properties, and vegetation cover and   predator abundance changed according to the magnitude of these declines.   However, skink and invertebrate abundance did not track these changes as   expected, but instead varied more or less consistently between   properties. Some fauna increased (skink captures quadrupled and cricket   captures nearly doubled), others declined (flies, caterpillars and   spiders), and some did not change (beetles, Millipedes, slugs and   grasshoppers, and faunal species richness and diversity). Therefore,   rabbits, predators and vegetation did not affect changes in skinks and   invertebrates in consistent ways.

Accordingly, KEGG pathway categories   related to degradation of aromatic ring-containing molecules (e.g.,   benzoate degradation) were identified in high abundance within forest   soil-derived metatranscriptomic datasets. The impact of land use type   forest on community composition and activity is evidently to a high   degree caused by the presence of wood breakdown products.   Correspondingly, bacterial groups known to be involved in lignin   degradation and containing ligninolytic genes such as Burkholderia,   Bradyrhizobium, and Azospirillum exhibited increased transcriptional   activity in forest soil.

Culturable and total Vibrio spp. estimates   by most-probable-number technique coupled with standard polymerase chain   reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR methods, respectively, were at least   one order of magnitude higher in sediment than in seawater. In addition,   potential human pathogenic species Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus   and Vibrio parahaemolyticus occurred in the sediment with V.   parahaemolyticus being the most frequently found. In the pelagic   environment, 60\% of total variance in culturable Vibrio data was   explained by sea surface temperature (40\%), salinity (13\%) and organic   matter concentration (7\%). In the benthic environment, sea surface   temperature was the only factor that significantly affected culturable   Vibrio occurrence although it explained only 25\% of total variance,   suggesting that additional unexplored factors may play a role as well.   No correlation was found between culturable Vibrio spp. concentrations   and the abundance of harpacticoid copepods in the sediment whilst a   negative correlation was found between Vibrio spp. and nematode   abundance which accounted for almost 90\% of the total meiofaunal   density. Taxonomic analysis revealed that selective bacterial feeders   accounted for nearly 50\% of the total nematode community and included   genera such as Terschellingia, Molgolaimus and Halalaimus, suggesting   that top-down control by nematode grazing may be an important factor   affecting Vibrio occurrence in these sediments.

However, how plants   distinctly interact with beneficial and detrimental organisms across   mosaic landscapes containing fragmented habitats is still poorly   understood. We experimentally tested feedback responses between plants   and soil microbial communities from adjacent habitats across a   disturbance gradient within a human-modified tropical montane landscape.   In a greenhouse experiment, two components of soil microbial communities   were amplified; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and a filtrate   excluding AMF spores from the soils of pastures (high disturbance),   coffee plantations (intermediate disturbance), and forest fragments (low   disturbance), using potted seedlings of 11 plant species common in these   habitats (pasture grass, coffee, and nine native species). We then   examined their effects on growth of these same 11 host species with   reciprocal habitat inoculation. Most plant species received a similar   benefit from AMF, but differed in their response to the filtrates from   the three habitats. Soil filtrate from pastures had a net negative   effect on plant growth, while filtrates from coffee plantations and   forests had a net positive effect on plant growth. Pasture grass,   coffee, and five pioneer tree species performed better with the filtrate   from ``away'' (where these species rarely occur) compared to   ``home'' (where these species typically occur) habitat soils, while   four shade-tolerant tree species grew similarly with filtrates from   different habitats. These results suggest that pastures accumulate   species-specific soil enemies, while coffee plantations and forests   accumulate beneficial soil microbes that benefit pioneer native plants   and coffee, respectively. Thus, compared to AMF, soil filtrates exerted   stronger habitat and host-specific effects on plants, being more   important mediators of plant-soil feedbacks across contrasting habitats.",1564,NO,SL,,,

Many impacts of these environmental variables on plant   damage are likely indirect and result because both resource availability   and diversity can influence plant traits associated with attractiveness   to herbivores or susceptibility to pathogens. We used a long-term,   manipulative field experiment to investigate how carbon dioxide (CO2)   enrichment, nitrogen (N) fertilization, and plant community diversity   affect plant traits and the amount of herbivore and pathogen damage   experienced by the common prairie legume Lespedeza capitata. We detected   little evidence that CO2 or N affected plant traits; however, plants   growing in high-diversity treatments (polycultures) were taller, were   less pubescent, and produced thinner leaves (higher specific leaf area).   Interestingly, we also detected little evidence that CO2 or N affect   damage. Plants growing in polycultures compared to monocultures,   however, experienced a fivefold increase in damage from generalist   herbivores, 64\% less damage from specialist herbivores, and 91\% less   damage from pathogens. Moreover, within diversity treatments, damage by   generalist herbivores was negatively correlated with pubescence and   often was positively correlated with plant height, while damage by   specialist herbivores typically was positively correlated with   pubescence and negatively associated with height. These patterns are   consistent with changes in plant traits driving differences in herbivory   between diversity treatments. In contrast, changes in measured plant   traits did not explain the difference in disease incidence between   monocultures and polycultures. In summary, our data provide little   evidence that CO2 or N supply alter damage from natural enemies. By   contrast, plants grown in monocultures experienced greater specialist   herbivore and pathogen damage but less generalist herbivore damage than   plants grown in diverse communities. Part of this diversity effect was   mediated by changes in plant traits, many of which likely are plastic   responses to diversity treatments, but some of which may be the result   of evolutionary changes in response to these long-term experimental   manipulations.",1565,NO,SL,,,

Species suffer from a suite of threats including   habitat destruction, alteration and fragmentation, introduced species,   over-exploitation, climate change, UV-B radiation, chemical   contaminants, diseases and the synergisms among them. These worldwide   threats are also present in northern landscapes and in Canada in   particular where 20 amphibian and 37 reptile species are listed as   at-risk by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada   (COSEWIC).

The ecologically important shore crab   (Carcinus maenas) is commonly infected by the rhizocephalan parasite   Sacculina carcini that aside from inflicting behavioral change,   castration and ceased molting, also feminizes its male host   morphologically. The latter results in reduced cheliped size, and,   together with the other parasite-induced effects, this may potentially   impact host feeding behavior. In two separate laboratory experiments, we   offered infected and uninfected adult male crabs respectively ad libitum   small, easy-to-handle blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) (10-15 mm in   shell-length), and a limited, size-structured prey population (15-45 mm   in shell-length; seven size-classes, ten mussels per class) during 10-15   days. Corrected for carapace width, the per capita consumption rate of   the infected and uninfected crabs was similar in either experiment, both   regarding number of mussels and amount of tissue dry-weight consumed.   Also, the median mussel size preyed upon when exposed to the   size-structure prey population was unaffected by infection. However,   infected crabs preyed less frequently (26\%) on intermediate mussel   sizes (25-30 mm) than uninfected crabs. For both infected and uninfected   crabs the median prey size increased linearly with maximum claw height.   Host dry weight was significantly reduced by infection, assumed to be   the result of the morphological feminization (reduced appendage size)   rather than reflecting poorer general condition of infected individuals.   Infected crabs were nonetheless subjected to a higher mortality rate   than uninfected crabs during the experimental period. We conclude that   Sacculina infection has a very limited effect on its host crabs' feeding   biology and that any measurable ecosystem ramifications of the   host-parasite association must originate from other processes; for   instance reduced mean size (infection inhibits molting) and density   (infection increases mortality) of the crab population where parasitism   is high.

The nematode   community occurring in a Controlled Microbial Composting (CMC) process   was analyzed with the objective of assessing whether the species   composition could be used as a bio-indicator of the compost maturity   status. The results obtained here describe the major shifts in species   composition that occur during the composting process. Compared to   terrestrial ecosystems, nematode succession in compost differs mainly in   the absence of K-strategists and numerical importance of diplogastrids.   At the beginning of the composting process (thermophilic phase),   immediately after the heat peak, the nematode population is primarily   built by bacterial feeding enrichment opportunists (cp-1) (Rhabditidae,   Panagrolaimidae, Diplogastridae) followed by the bacterial-feeding   general opportunists (cp-2) (Cephalobidae) and the fungal-feeding   general opportunists (Aphelenchoididae). Thereafter, during the cooling   and maturation stage, the bacterial-feeding-predator opportunistic   nematodes (Mononchoides sp.) became dominant. Finally, at the most   mature stage, the fungal-feeding Anguinidae (mainly Ditylenchus filimus)   were most present. Both, the Maturity Index (MI) and the   fungivorous/bacterivorous ratio (f/b ratio), increase as the compost   becomes more mature (ranging, respectively, from 1 to 1.86 and from 0 to   11.90).

Despite their   theoretic importance, experimental data on the net metabolic impact of   phage infection on the bacterial metabolism remains scarce. In this   study, we tracked the dynamics of intracellular metabolites using   untargeted high coverage metabolomics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells   infected with lytic bacteriophages from six distinct phage genera.   Analysis of the metabolomics data indicates an active interference in   the host metabolism. In general, phages elicit an increase in pyrimidine   and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Furthermore, clear phage-specific and   infection stage-specific responses are observed, ranging from extreme   metabolite depletion (for example, phage YuA) to complete reorganization   of the metabolism (for example, phage phiKZ). As expected, pathways   targeted by the phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were   enriched among the metabolites changing during infection. The effect on   pyrimidine metabolism of phages encoding AMGs capable of host genome   degradation (for example, YuA and LUZ19) was distinct from those lacking   nuclease-encoding genes (for example, phiKZ), which demonstrates the   link between the encoded set of AMGs of a phage and its impact on host   physiology. However, a large fraction of the profound effect on host   metabolism could not be attributed to the phage-encoded AMGs. We suggest   a potentially crucial role for small, `non-enzymatic' peptides in   metabolism take-over and hypothesize on potential biotechnical   applications for such peptides.

Thermoregulation and pathogen resistance are two energetically   demanding processes that co-occur during seasonal epidemics for many   endothermic vertebrates. The ability of hosts to cope with these   processes simultaneously may influence population-level disease   dynamics. 2. In North American house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus),   outbreaks of the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum occur during fall   and winter, when ambient temperatures across the hosts range are often   below thermoneutrality. Here, we examined how ambient temperature   influences host energetics and susceptibility to this naturally   occurring seasonal pathogen by experimentally infecting wild-caught   house finches with M. gallisepticum at either thermoneutral or   subthermoneutral temperatures in the laboratory. We quantified the   metabolic costs of infection, measures of body condition, two components   of the acute-phase response, disease expression and pathogen loads under   both temperature regimes. 3. The metabolic costs of simultaneous   infection with M. gallisepticum and thermoregulation were additive and   significant (combined costs of 4.71 kJ per night; within the range of   the daily energy requirements of passerine moult). Contrary to our   predictions, house finches at subthermoneutral temperatures had lower   disease expression and higher circulating levels of the cytokine   interleukin-6 in response to experimental infection with M.   gallisepticum than finches at thermoneutral. However, pathogen loads did   not differ between the two temperature treatments. Finches from both   treatments expressed fever in response to infection, but the magnitude   of fever did not vary with ambient temperature. 4. Despite the   significant energy costs of infection and thermoregulation, house   finches from both temperature treatments maintained body mass and   pectoral muscle condition, suggesting that birds housed at   subthermoneutral consumed more food to maintain energy balance. In the   field, competition for finite resources would be expected to exacerbate   the effects found here and force infected birds to spend more time at   feeders where M. gallisepticum is transmitted. 5. Overall, our results   indicate that moderate cold stress alters house finch immunity,   energetics and disease pathology, but does not alter infectiousness as   measured by pathogen load. The effects of ambient temperature on host   response and energy demands could directly or indirectly contribute to   seasonal and geographical variation in disease dynamics in free-living   house finches. More broadly, our results suggest that even subtle   changes in abiotic factors such as temperature can alter host disease   expression, with broad implications for disease dynamics.",1573,NO,SL,,,

Our study aimed to characterize these ocean   temperature patterns at biologically relevant scales.   Location   Global, with a focus on coral reefs.   Methods   We created a 4-km resolution, 21-year global ocean temperature anomaly   (deviations from long-term means) database to quantify the spatial and   temporal characteristics of temperature anomalies related to both coral   bleaching and disease. Then we tested how patterns varied in several key   metrics of disturbance severity, including anomaly frequency, magnitude,   duration and size.   Results   Our analyses found both global variation in temperature anomalies and   fine-grained spatial variability in the frequency, duration and   magnitude of temperature anomalies. However, we discovered that even   during major climatic events with strong spatial signatures, like the El   Nino-Southern Oscillation, areas that had high numbers of anomalies   varied between years. In addition, we found that 48\% of   bleaching-related anomalies and 44\% of disease-related anomalies were   less than 50 km2, much smaller than the resolution of most models used   to forecast climate changes.   Main conclusions   The fine-scale variability in temperature anomalies has several key   implications for understanding spatial patterns in coral bleaching- and   disease-related anomalies as well as for designing protected areas to   conserve coral reefs in a changing climate. Spatial heterogeneity in   temperature anomalies suggests that certain reefs could be targeted for   protection because they exhibit differences in thermal stress. However,   temporal variability in anomalies could complicate efforts to protect   reefs, because high anomalies in one year are not necessarily predictive   of future patterns of stress. Together, our results suggest that   temperature anomalies related to coral bleaching and disease are likely   to be highly heterogeneous and could produce more localized impacts of   climate change.",1574,NO,SL,,,

The   overarching aim of this study was to investigate top-down control   processes of PPN in these natural ecosystems through comparative   analyses of the diversity and dynamics of PPN and their microbial   enemies. Our specific aims were, first, to identify and quantify PPN   microbial enemies in European sand dunes; second, to assess their life   history traits, their spatial and temporal variation in these   ecosystems, and third, to evaluate their control potential of PPN   populations. This was done by seasonal sampling of a range of sites and   making observations on both the nematode and the microbial enemy   communities in rhizosphere sand. Nine different nematode microbial   enemies belonging to different functional groups were detected in   European sand dunes. Their high diversity in these low productivity   ecosystems could both result from or lead to the lack of dominance of a   particular nematode genus. The distribution of microbial enemies was   spatially and temporally variable, both among and within sampling sites.   Obligate parasites, either with low host-specificity or having the   ability to form an environmentally resistant propagule, are favoured in   these ecosystems and are more frequent and abundant than facultative   parasites. Three microbial enemies correlated, either positively or   negatively, with PPN population size: Catenaria spp., Hirsutella   rhossiliensis and Pasteuria penetrans. Microbial-enemy supported links   in the food-web may be involved in the control of PPN populations   through indirect effects. The endospore-forming P. penetrans was the   most successful top-down control agent, and was implicated in the direct   control of Meloidogyne spp. and indirect facilitation of Pratylenchus   spp. Overall, our findings suggest strong and diverse top-down control   effects on the nematode community in these natural ecosystems.",1576,NO,SL,,,

At a landscape scale, heterogeneous distribution   of a wildlife host will create regional hot spots for disease risk,   while at the farm level, distributional patterns of wildlife excretory   products as well as habitat use are of primary importance to the   assessment of disease risk to livestock. In the UK, badgers have been   implicated in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis to cattle. In this   study, we focus on the spatial and social organization and habitat use   of badgers as well as the distributions of their excretions at latrine   and sett sites to assess intra- and inter-species (badger-cattle)   disease risk. Across the study site, badger latrines and setts were   found in prominent clusters, at distances of up to 250 and 200 m   respectively. This was partly due to small-scale clustering of latrines   around sett sites, so that disease risk may be higher within the   vicinity of setts. The clustered distribution suggests that sites of   high risk for TB transmission may be localised within farms. Exclusion   of cattle from the few sett and latrine sites within their grazing   pasture is therefore likely to provide an effective way of reducing the   risk of disease transmission. We also found evidence of social   sub-division within badger social groups based on differences in the use   of main and outlier setts. This may contribute to localised clusters of   infection within the badger population, resulting in heterogeneous   patterns of environmental disease risk to the wider host community.

An underappreciated function of many bivalves in these   systems is shell formation. The ecological significance of bivalve shell   has been recognized; geochemical effects are now more clearly being   understood. A positive feedback exists between shell aggregations and   healthy bivalve populations in temperate estuaries, thus linking   population dynamics to shell budgets and alkalinity cycling. On oyster   reefs a balanced shell budget requires healthy long-lived bivalves to   maximize shell input per mortality event thereby countering shell loss.   Active and dense populations of filter-feeding bivalves couple   production of organic-rich waste with precipitation of calcium carbonate   minerals, creating conditions favorable for alkalinity regeneration.   Although the dynamics of these processes are not well described, the   balance between shell burial and metabolic acid production seems the key   to the extent of alkalinity production vs. carbon burial as shell. We   present an estimated alkalinity budget that highlights the significant   role oyster reefs once played in the Chesapeake Bay inorganic-carbon   cycle.

One key element in developing predictive models for   these impacts is the life cycle of the parasite. It is, for example,   commonly assumed that parasites with an indirect life cycle would be   more sensitive to changing environmental conditions than parasites with   a direct life cycle due to the greater chance that at least one of their   obligate host species will go extinct. Here, we challenge this notion by   contrasting parasitic nematodes with a direct life cycle against those   with an indirect life cycle. Specifically, we suggest that behavioral   thermoregulation by the intermediate host may buffer the larvae of   indirectly transmitted parasites against temperature extremes, and hence   climate warming. We term this the shelter effect'. Formalizing each life   cycle in a comprehensive model reveals a fitness advantage for the   direct life cycle over the indirect life cycle at low temperatures, but   the shelter effect reverses this advantage at high temperatures. When   examined for seasonal environments, the models suggest that climate   warming may in some regions create a temporal niche in mid-summer that   excludes parasites with a direct life cycle, but allows parasites with   an indirect life cycle to persist. These patterns are amplified if   parasite larvae are able to manipulate their intermediate host to   increase ingestion probability by definite hosts. Furthermore, our   results suggest that exploiting the benefits of host sheltering may have   aided the evolution of indirect life cycles. Our modeling framework   utilizes the Metabolic Theory of Ecology to synthesize the complexities   of host behavioral thermoregulation and its impacts on various   temperature-dependent parasite life history components in a single   measure of fitness, R-0. It allows quantitative predictions of climate   change impacts, and is easily generalized to many host-parasite systems.",1583,no,SL,,,

While evidence exists from many ecosystems that declines in host   biodiversity may lead to greater risk of disease emergence, the role of   pathogen diversity in the emergence process remains poorly understood.   Particularly, because a more diverse pool of pathogen types provides   more ways in which evolutionary innovations may arise, we suggest that   host-pathogen systems with high pathogen diversity are more prone to   disease emergence than systems with relatively homogeneous pathogen   communities. We call this prediction the diversity-emergence hypothesis.   To show how this hypothesis could be tested, we studied a system   comprised of North American shorebirds and their associated   low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. These viruses are   important as a potential source of genetic innovations in influenza. A   theoretical contribution of this study is an expression predicting the   rate of viral subtype reassortment to be proportional to both prevalence   and Simpson's Index, a formula that has been used traditionally to   quantify biodiversity. We then estimated prevalence and subtype   diversity in host species at Delaware Bay, a North American AIV hotspot,   and used our model to extrapolate from these data.   We estimated that 4 to 39 virus subtypes circulated at Delaware Bay each   year between 2000 and 2008, and that surveillance coverage (percentage   of co-circulating subtypes collected) at Delaware Bay is only about 63   center dot 0\%. Simpson's Index in the same period varied more than   fourfold from 0 center dot 22 to 0 center dot 93. These measurements   together with the model provide an indirect, model-based estimate of the   reassortment rate. A proper test of the diversity-emergence hypothesis   would require these results to be joined to independent and reliable   estimates of reassortment, perhaps obtained through molecular   surveillance.   These results suggest both that subtype diversity (and therefore   reassortment) varies from year to year and that several subtypes   contributing to reassortment are going undetected. The similarity   between these results and more detailed studies of one host, ruddy   turnstone (Arenaria interpres), further suggests that this species may   be the primary host for influenza reassortment at Delaware Bay.   Biological diversity has long been quantified using Simpson's Index. Our   model links this formula to a mechanistic account of reassortment in   multipathogen systems in the form of subtype diversity at Delaware Bay,   USA.

In addition, single plants of   each species in the grassland community were grown with the same   treatments to distinguish direct AMF effects from indirect effects via   plant competition. We found that AMF changed plant community structure   by influencing the plant species differently. At the community level,   AMF decreased the productivity by 15-24\%, depending on the particular   AMF treatment, mainly because two dominant species, Holcus lanatus and   Plantago lanceolata, showed a negative mycorrhizal dependency.   Concomitantly, plant diversity increased due to AMF inoculation and was   highest in the treatment with a combination of two commercial AM   strains. AMF had a positive effect on growth of the hemiparasite, and   thereby induced a negative impact of the hemiparasite on host plant   biomass which was not found in non-inoculated communities. However, the   hemiparasite did not increase plant diversity. Our results highlight the   importance of interactions with soil microbes for plant community   structure and that these indirect effects can vary among AMF treatments.

The non-bloom forming picoplankter Micromonas   pusilla, a significant component of the plankton community worldwide, is   known to be susceptible to infection by both dsDNA and dsRNA viruses.   Logically, comprehensive knowledge of the ecology of M. pusilla requires   a better understanding of the diversity and infection mechanisms of   their viruses. Here, we investigated 19 new M. pusilla-specific viruses   (MpVs) isolated from different locations and years. We performed partial   characterization of those MpVs including structural characteristics,   genome size, phylogenetic analysis based on partial DNA polymerase gene   sequences, host range, and stability at different temperatures and upon   exposure to chloroform. Combined, these characteristics allowed   classification of the MpVs into 2 groups. Exposure to chloroform led to   loss of infectivity by all MpVs in one group, which suggests the   presence of an outer lipid envelope. In addition, all except one of the   members in that group formed a monophylogenetic clade that was distinct   from all other MpV isolates. The distinctive characteristics of the 2   MpV groups suggest different infection strategies, which may have   important implications for the ecology of both host and virus   populations in the environment.

The contribution   of parasites to total biomass is often considered negligible; recent   evidence suggests otherwise, although it comes from a narrow range of   natural systems. Quantifying how local parasite biomass, whether that of   a single species or an assemblage of species sharing the same host,   varies across localities with host population biomass, is critical to   determine what constrains parasite populations. We use an extensive   dataset on all free-living and parasitic metazoan species from multiple   sites in New Zealand lakes to measure parasite biomass and test how it   covaries with host biomass. In all lakes, trematodes had the highest   combined biomass among parasite taxa, ranging from about 0.01 to 0.25 g   m(-2), surpassing the biomass of minor free-living taxa. Unlike findings   from other studies, the life stage contributing the most to total   trematode biomass was the metacercarial stage in the second intermediate   host, and not sporocysts or rediae within snail first intermediate   hosts, possibly due to low prevalence and small snail sizes. For   populations of single parasite species, we found no relationship between   host and parasite biomass for either juvenile or adult nematodes. In   contrast, all life stages of trematodes had local biomasses that   correlated positively with those of their hosts. For assemblages of   parasite species sharing the same host, we found strong relationships   between local host population biomass and the total biomass of parasites   supported. In these host-parasite biomass relationships, the scaling   factor (slope in log-log space) suggests that parasites may not be   making full use of available host resources. Host populations appear   capable of supporting a little more parasite biomass, and may be open to   expansion of existing parasites or invasion by new ones.",1589,YES,SL,yes,,

Large-seeded plants   can be particularly vulnerable due to highly specialized dispersal   systems and no compensatory regeneration mechanisms. Whitebark pine (   Pinus albicaulis), a keystone subalpine species, obligately depends upon   the Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) for dispersal of its   large, wingless seeds. Clark's Nutcracker, a facultative mutualist with   whitebark pine, is sensitive to rates of energy gain, and emigrates from   subalpine forests during periods of cone shortages. The invasive fungal   pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust,   reduces whitebark pine cone production by killing cone-bearing branches   and trees. Mortality from blister rust reaches 90\% or higher in some   whitebark pine forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, and the   rust now occurs nearly rangewide in whitebark pine. Our objectives were   to identify the minimum level of cone production necessary to elicit   seed dispersal by nutcrackers and to determine how cone production is   influenced by forest structure and health. We quantified forest   conditions and ecological interactions between nutcrackers and whitebark   pine in three Rocky Mountain ecosystems that differ in levels of rust   infection and mortality. Both the frequency of nutcracker occurrence and   probability of seed dispersal were strongly related to annual whitebark   pine cone production, which had a positive linear association with live   whitebark pine basal area, and negative linear association with   whitebark pine tree mortality and rust infection. From our data, we   estimated that a threshold level of similar to 1000 cones/ha is needed   for a high likelihood of seed dispersal by nutcrackers ( probability >=   0.7), and that this level of cone production can be met by forests with   live whitebark pine basal area >5.0 m(2)/ha. The risk of mutualism   disruption is greatest in northernmost Montana ( USA), where three-year   mean cone production and live basal area fell below predicted threshold   levels. There, nutcracker occurrence, seed dispersal, and whitebark pine   regeneration were the lowest of the three ecosystems. Managers can use   these threshold values to differentiate between restoration sites   requiring planting of rust-resistant seedlings and sites where   nutcracker seed dispersal can be expected.",1590,MAYBE,SL,yes,,

Here, we test whether reducing   ambient temperature alters host foraging, pathology and the potential   for fomite transmission of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma   gallisepticum (MG), which causes seasonal outbreaks of severe   conjunctivitis in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus). We housed   finches at temperatures within or below the thermoneutral zone to   manipulate food intake by altering energetic requirements of   thermoregulation. We predicted that pathogen deposition on bird feeders   would increase with temperature-driven increases in food intake and with   conjunctival pathology. As expected, housing birds below the   thermoneutral zone increased food consumption. Despite this difference,   pathogen deposition on feeders did not vary across temperature   treatments. However, pathogen deposition increased with conjunctival   pathology, independently of temperature and pathogen load, suggesting   that MG could enhance its transmission by increasing virulence. Our   results suggest that in this system, host physiological responses are   more important for transmission potential than temperature-dependent   alterations in feeding. Understanding such behavioural and physiological   contributions to disease transmission is critical to linking individual   responses to climate with population-level disease dynamics.",1591,NO,SL,,,

Field-margin diversification through conservation and restoration of   hedgerows is becoming a prominent intervention for promoting   biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in intensive agricultural   landscapes. However, how increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape   can affect ecosystem services has rarely been considered.   2. Here, we assessed the effect of increased field-margin complexity at   the local scale and increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape on   the provision of pest control, weed control and potential pollination.   Locally, three types of field margin were compared as follows: (i)   standard grass margin, (ii) simple hedgerow and (iii) complex hedgerow,   along two independent gradients of hedgerow cover and arable land cover   in the landscape. We performed an exclusion experiment to measure   biological control of cereal aphids and assessed natural enemy and pest   abundance in the field. We sampled plant weed communities and performed   a phytometer experiment to test the effects of pollinators on plant   reproductive success.   3. At the local scale, planting a new hedgerow or improving its   structural complexity and vegetation diversity did not enhance the   delivery of ecosystem services in the neighbouring field.   4. However, high cover of hedgerows in the landscape enhanced aphid   parasitism (from 12 to 18\%) and potential pollination (visitation rate   and seed set increased up to 70\%) irrespective of local margin quality.   The cover of arable land in the landscape reduced the abundance of   plant-dwelling predators and weed diversity, but did not affect the   delivery of the investigated ecosystem services.   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the key importance   of the surrounding landscape context, rather than local factors, to the   delivery of ecosystem services. This suggests a need for new policies   that pay particular attention to the conservation of hedgerows at large   scales for promoting multiple ecosystem services in agroecosystems.   Specifically, hedgerows can serve to develop a network of ecological   corridors that can facilitate the movement of beneficial organisms, such   as pollinators and natural enemies in the agricultural matrix. Such   interventions may be a `low cost-high benefit solution', since farmers   can create or conserve high-quality habitats taking little or no land   from crop production and without the need to change their crop   management.",1593,NO,SL,,,

Whether plant performance in soils with   spatially heterogeneous PSF can be predicted from pot experiments with   homogeneous soils is unclear. In a glasshouse experiment, we tested the   response of monocultures of six grassland species (two grasses, two   legumes and two forbs) to three spatially explicit treatments   (fine-grained heterogeneity, coarse-grained heterogeneity and   homogeneous). Sixteen patches of conditioned soil (6x6cm) were placed   within each container. For homogeneous treatments, all patches contained   the same conditioned soil within a container. The fine-grained   heterogeneous treatment contained four differently conditioned soils   that were applied following a Latin square design, while for the   coarse-grained heterogeneous treatment, four contiguous square blocks of   four cells each were created in each container. In general, species grew   worse on soil conditioned by conspecifics. However, when the biomass   production on all homogeneous soil treatments (own and foreign soils)   was averaged and compared to the heterogeneous treatments, we found that   biomass production was lower than expected in the heterogeneous soils.   This effect of heterogeneity depended on both the conditioning and test   species, but most heterogeneity effects were negative. The grain of the   heterogeneity (coarse vs. fine: at the chosen spatial scale) did not   affect plant performance. We hypothesize that a more diverse soil   community is present in spatially heterogeneous soils. This increases   (i) the chance of plants to encounter its antagonists, which may then   rapidly increase in numbers; and (ii) the scope for synergistic   co-infections. Together, this may lead to non-additive responses of   plants to spatial heterogeneity in PSF.Synthesis. Plant performance was   lower in spatially heterogeneous soils than predicted by spatially   homogeneous soils. In natural grasslands that have mixed plant   communities conditioning the soil, plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects on   plant performance may therefore be more negative than what is predicted   from pot experiments. Our results emphasize the need to incorporate the   spatial dynamics of PSF both in empirical and modelling studies if we   are to understand the role of PSF in plant-plant interactions and plant   community dynamics.",1594,NO,SL,,,

In the   absence of disease epidemics, increased human disturbance or predation,   we applied multilevel, mixed, regression models to assess the hypothesis   that the collapse from high to low breeding success was due primarily to   changes in prey availability. Under this hypothesis, we predicted that   longer foraging trips would be associated with reduced breeding   performance in cohorts of kittiwakes-groups marked with   radio-transmitters at the same colony in the same year. We separately   modeled two response variables: foraging trip-durations made during the   incubation and early chick stages. Multilevel mixed models revealed only   weak variation at the cohort-level in either response variable; hatching   success and fledging success accounted for none or less than 2\% of the   total variation in trip-durations made during the incubation and early   chick stages, respectively The majority of the variation in our response   variables was at the observation (ca. 80-90\%) and bird (or individual)   levels (ca. 10-12\%). Our results expose the unreliability of using   indirect evidence to implicate prey availability as the primary cause of   widespread breeding failures in colonial seabirds. In the ecological   literature, two types of inferences seem particularly vulnerable to   indirect evidence: inferences following studies on species that are   accepted or strongly promoted as bioindicators of changes in marine   productivity such as the black-legged kittiwake, and inferences that   implicate a fisheries-induced reduction in prey availability to failed   breeding. In light of these pitfalls, we recommend that long-term   monitoring studies on kittiwakes and other seabirds carefully consider   in their study designs and implementations multiple working hypotheses   that might explain major changes in breeding success.

The capacity of parasitic plants in structuring natural communities   is increasingly recognized. These plants can affect the structure,   composition and productivity of plant communities by modifying the   competitive balance between hosts and non-host species and by altering   the quantity and quality of resources entering the soil. Despite the   progress made in this field, there is still a lack of integrative   studies showing the structuring capacity of parasitic plants in forest   ecosystems, where their effect may be less detectable due to the long   life span of the system.   2. In this study we evaluate the long-term impact of Viscum album subsp.   austriacum on the woody-plant community of a Mediterranean pineland.   This mistletoe remains several years on the same host, exerting   long-lasting, spatially concentrated effects on community and ecosystem   characteristics. Mistletoe concentrates zoochorous seeds and induces   changes in the soil fertility and light availability beneath the canopy   of parasitized trees, which have the potential to facilitate   zoochorous-plant colonization, recruitment, and growth at the same time   as it weakens the host. Here, we analyse whether mistletoe-driven   changes could result in a nucleus of zoochorous woody plants nourished   by the abundant organic detritus accumulated under the host. We also   analyse whether mistletoe effects can expand after host death.   3. We selected unparasitized, parasitized, and dead parasitized Pinus   nigra trees, in which we studied the joint effect of mistletoe-mediated   changes in soil nutrient and light availability, with the seed rain,   seed predation, seedling establishment, plant recruitment, and plant   growth. Light-and soil-nutrient resources were greater under parasitized   trees, and intensified after host death. The seed rain was maximum under   parasitized trees, where seedling recruitment proved more likely.   Sapling density, richness, and growth increased with the development of   parasitism.   4. Our findings show that V. album exerts a strong and lasting impact on   the structure and dynamics of Mediterranean pinelands, with parasitized   trees acting as centres for the establishment and growth of colonizing   fleshy-fruited woody species, which, over the long term, promote   vegetation shifts by limiting dominant pine trees and facilitating less   represented fleshy-fruited shrubs.",1600,MAYBE,SL,yes,,"count seed predation as secondary production? no, because we don't know who ate it. plant coverage as primary production? yes"

However, hosts might not discriminate between strains in mixed   infections, allowing nonfixing strains to escape sanctions. We construct   an adaptive dynamics model of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation and find   general situations where symbionts undergo adaptive diversification, but   in most situations complete nonfixers do not evolve.

Larval parasitoids (i.e. parasitoids attacking host larvae)   constitute a major source of mortality in many ecologically and   economically important forest insects, but how this mortality affects   spatio-temporal population dynamics is often not clear.   2. In sub-arctic Fennoscandian birch forest, the two geometrids Epirrita   autumnata and Operophtera brumata exhibit pronounced outbreak cycles   with significant ecosystem impacts. As mortality owing to larval   parasitoids often is very high, the hypothesis that parasitism   terminates outbreaks has been advocated, but without decisive empirical   evidence.   3. We analysed the altitude- and species-specific timing of population   outbreaks typically seen in the coastal section of the sub-arctic birch   forest ecosystem to evaluate the critical premise that   parasitoid-inflicted larval mortality ought to predict geometrid   population growth.   4. However, despite temporally high rates of parasitism, this did not   influence the strongly species- and altitude-patterned geometrid   outbreaks. We therefore conclude that termination of cyclic outbreaks in   these geometrids is caused by other regulatory mechanisms than larval   parasitoids.   5. Regardless of their lack of effect on the altitude-specific outbreak   dynamics, larval parasitoids accounted for some of the local spatial   variance in the temporal dynamics.

We compared the abundance of soil arthropods   (Acari and Collembola) from paired patches with and without dense   infections of snow fungi in the forest understory of a northern Swedish   boreal forest after snow melt. Although we did not find increased   abundance of these animals when snow fungi were present, Collembola and   Acari were sustained on a diet of snow fungi for six months. The isotope   signature of the snow fungi clearly differed from humus and other fungal   types from literature values obtained from similar boreal forests,   suggesting that these fungi may occupy a novel N niche during winter in   northern boreal forests. Our study shows for the first time that snow   fungi are a potential food source for micro-arthropods during winter and   spring. Potentially, snow fungi may represent the basis of an unexplored   sub-nivean winter food web but further work is required to assess their   importance for community development and winter litter decomposition.

We examined the abundance of   total and cultivable bacteria in relation to changes in biogeochemical   conditions in the eastern Atlantic Ocean with special regard to Vibrio   spp., a group of bacteria that can cause diseases in human and aquatic   organisms. Surface, deep water and plankton (<20 mu m, 20-55 mu m and   >55 mu m) samples were collected between 50 degrees N and 24 degrees S.   Chlorophyll-a was very low (<0.3 mu g l(-1)) in most areas of the   nutrient-poor Atlantic, except at a few locations near upwelling   regions. In surface water, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen   (DON) concentrations were 64-95 mu M C and 2(-)10 mu M N accounting for   >= 90\% and >= 76\% of total organic C and N, respectively. DOC and DON   gradually decreased to similar to 45 mu M C and <5 mu M N in the bottom   water. In the surface layer, culture independent total bacteria and   other prokaryotes represented by 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)   counts, ranged mostly between 10(7) and 10(8) cells l(-1), while   cultivable bacterial counts (CBC) and Vibrio spp. were found at   concentrations of 10(4)-10(7) and 10(2)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)   l(-1), respectively. Most bacteria (>99 \%) were found in the   nanoplankton fraction (<20 mu m), however, bacterial abundance did not   correlate with suspended particulates (chlorophyll-a, particulate   organic C [POC] and N [PON]). Instead, we found a highly significant   correlation between bacterial abundance and temperature (p < 0.001) and   a significant correlation with DOC and DON (p < 0.005 and < 0.01,   respectively). In comparison to CBC and DAPI-stained prokaryotes,   cultivable Vibrio showed a stronger and highly significant correlation   with DOC and DON (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.005, respectively). In cold   waters of the mesopelagic and abyssal zones, CBC was 50 to 100-times   lower than in the surface layer; however, cultivable Vibrio spp. could   be isolated from the bathypelagic zone and even near the seafloor   (average similar to 10 CFU l(-1)). The depth-wise decrease in CBC and   Vibrio coincided with the decrease in both DOC and POC.

Here, we evaluate the individual and interactive effects   of resident diversity and resource enrichment on plant community   resistance to invasion. We factorially manipulated plant diversity and   the enrichment of belowground (soil nitrogen) and aboveground (light)   resources in low-fertility grassland communities invaded by Lolium   arundinaceum, the most abundant invasive grass in eastern North America.   Soil nitrogen enrichment enhanced L. arundinaceum performance, but   increased resident diversity dampened this effect of nitrogen   enrichment. Increased light availability (via clipping of aboveground   vegetation) had a negligible effect on community invasibility. These   results demonstrate that a community's susceptibility to invasion can be   contingent upon the type of resource pulse and the diversity of resident   species. In order to assess the generality of these results, future   studies that test the effects of resident diversity and resource   enrichment against a range of invasive species and in other   environmental contexts (e.g., sites differing in soil fertility and   light regimes) are needed. Such studies may help to resolve conflicting   interpretations of the diversity-invasibility relationship and provide   direction for management strategies.",1605,NO,SL,,,

Species within the brown algal genus Durvillaea   are major ecosystem engineers throughout the sub-Antarctic and   cold-temperate Southern Hemisphere, and a newly described genus of   protistan parasite, Maullinia, was recently found infecting D.   antarctica in Chile. We set out to address 3 key questions. (1) Is there   evidence for trans-oceanic dispersal of Maullinia? (2) Does Maullinia   infect other Durvillaea species? (3) Does infection prevalence vary   throughout the hosts' ranges? We sampled Maullinia on Durvillaea   populations along coasts in Chile (D. antarctica, from 32 degrees to 42   degrees S: 8 sites), Australia (D. potatorum and D. amatheiae, from 36   degrees to 38 degrees S: 5 sites) and sub-Antarctic Marion Island (46   degrees 53' 47 `' S, 37 degrees 43' 32 `' E). We used a genetic marker   (18S rRNA) to verify the presence of Maullinia on Durvillaea at all   sites and visual surveys of Maullinia galls to assess infection   prevalence in Chile and Australia. We confirm that Maullinia infects   Australian Durvillaea species, but our results indicate that each host   species is parasitised by a different Maullinia lineage. Maullinia   infection prevalence increased with latitude. Long- and short-distance   dispersal events are inferred to have occurred based on genetic   patterns. We conclude that Maullinia protists are broadly distributed   and affect multiple host species, including at least 3 Durvillaea   species (2 in Australia, and 1 in both Chile and Marion Island), and   that environmental factors influence host susceptibility to infection.",1606,NO,SL,,,

It is now well known that   the proportion of semi-natural habitats as well as organic farming   enhance abundance and species richness of natural enemies in   agroecosystems. However, few studies have examined how these   environmental variables affect natural pest control services. Moreover,   most studies have been performed in annual cropping systems and almost   nothing is known about the effect of landscape complexity and organic   farming in perennial crops, which differ greatly from annual ones in   terms of disturbance regimes. In this study, we analyzed how landscape   composition and farming systems affect abundance of insect pests of   grape and their parasitism rates in 79 vineyards in southwestern France.   Our results show that farming systems and host density affect biological   control of tortricid moths by their parasitoids. Surprisingly, organic   fields had lower parasitism rates compared to conventional ones and this   rate was negatively correlated to host density at the field scale. We   also found that moth community composition depended on the proportion of   grapevine crop in the landscape in a 1 km radius but that pest abundance   and parasitism rates did not change with landscape complexity. Our   results suggest that some farming practices that are frequent in organic   farming, such as organic-certified insecticides, copper or sulfur, can   reduce parasitoid populations and thus limit biological control in   vineyards. Negative density dependence relationship between parasitism   rates and host abundance suggest a dilution effect of the biological   control potential at the landscape scale and potential mechanisms such   as variable parasitoid population sizes, relatively limited female   longevity or fecundity, as well as increase in handling time. Further   research on the effect of organic and conventional farming practices are   now needed to provide a more mechanistic understanding of how these   agricultural practices shape ecological processes such as biological   control of pests.

A number of theoretical studies have   argued that infection with certain male-killing endosymbionts can   potentially lead to the evolution of haplodiploidy. By explicitly   investigating the coevolutionary dynamics between host and endosymbiont,   we show that the assumptions of current models cannot explain the   evolution of haplodiploidy very well, as the endosymbiont will often go   extinct in the long term. Here, we provide two additional mechanisms   that can explain the stable evolution of haplodiploidy by male-killing   endosymbionts. First of all, a spatially structured population can   facilitate the long-term persistence of haplodiploidy, but this applies   only when levels of inbreeding are very high. By contrast, endosymbionts   that are mutualistic with their hosts provide a much more general and   promising route to the stable evolution of haplodiploidy. This model is   the first to provide a formal explanation of the supposed association   between the evolution of haplodiploidy and the highly inbred lifestyles   of some ancestors, while it also provides a hypothesis for the evolution   of haplodiploidy in more outbred ancestors.",1608,MAYBE,SL,no,modeling study,

Drought   stress leads to sequential morphological, physiological, biochemical and   molecular changes that can have severe effects on plant growth,   development and productivity. As a consequence of these changes, the   interaction between plants and insects can be altered. Using cultivated   Brassica oleracea plants, the parasitoid Microplitis mediator and its   herbivorous host Mamestra brassicae, we studied the effect of drought   stress on (1) the emission of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs),   (2) plant hormone titres, (3) preference and performance of the   herbivore, and (4) preference of the parasitoid. Higher levels of   jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were recorded in response to   herbivory, but no significant differences were observed for salicylic   acid (SA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Drought significantly impacted   SA level and showed a significant interactive effect with herbivory for   IAA levels. A total of 55 VOCs were recorded and the difference among   the treatments was influenced largely by herbivory, where the emission   rate of fatty acid-derived volatiles, nitriles and   (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene [(E)-DMNT] was enhanced. Mamestra   brassicae moths preferred to lay eggs on drought-stressed over control   plants; their offspring performed similarly on plants of both   treatments.

In recent years, plant-soil feedback   that can, for example, be caused by below-ground microorganisms has been   suggested to play a role in maintaining plant coexistence and to be a   potential driver of the positive relationship between plant diversity   and ecosystem functioning. Most of the studies addressing these topics   have focused on the species level. However, in addition to interspecific   interactions, intraspecific interactions might be important for the   structure of natural communities. Here, we examine intraspecific   coexistence and intraspecific diversity effects using 10 natural   accessions of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. We   assessed morphological intraspecific diversity by measuring several   above-and below-ground traits. We performed a plant-soil feedback   experiment that was based on these trait differences between the   accessions in order to determine whether A. thaliana experiences   feedback at intraspecific level as a result of trait differences. We   also experimentally tested the diversity-productivity relationship at   intraspecific level. We found strong differences in above-and   below-ground traits between the A. thaliana accessions. Overall,   plant-soil feedback occurred at intraspecific level. However, accessions   differed in the direction and strength of this feedback: Some accessions   grew better on their own soils, some on soils from other accessions.   Furthermore, we found positive diversity effects within A. thaliana:   Accession mixtures produced a higher total above-ground biomass than   accession monocultures. Differences between accessions in their feedback   response could not be explained by morphological traits. Therefore, we   suggest that they might have been caused by accession-specific   accumulated soil communities, by root exudates, or by accession-specific   resource use based on genetic differences that are not expressed in   morphological traits. Synthesis. Our results provide some of the first   evidence for intraspecific plant-soil feedback and intraspecific   overyielding. These findings may have wider implications for the   maintenance of variation within species and the importance of this   variation for ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the need for   an increased focus on intraspecific processes in plant diversity   research to fully understand the mechanisms of coexistence and ecosystem   functioning.",1610,NO,SL,,,

Several authors have suggested that warming will increase prevalence of   diseases at high latitudes, yet long-term studies are lacking. We   evaluated how parasite abundance and prevalence in an ecologically and   economically important species (juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus   nerka) has changed in an Alaskan watershed that has experienced   substantial climatic change over the past half-century. We hypothesized   that the average increase in summer water temperature of 1.9A degrees C   over the past 46 years in our study system would have resulted in a   corresponding increase in fish metabolism, and thus potential   consumption rates, that would increase infestation rates of the tapeworm   Triaenophorus crassus. However, our comparison of data from 1948-1960 to   2008-2009 provided no evidence that the parasite load in juvenile   sockeye salmon has significantly changed and that there is no   significant relationship between summer temperature and average   infestation rates.

Hunting-induced defaunation can disrupt these interactions, altering   tree recruitment, forest structure, and carbon storage, with strong   effects at the seed and seedling stages. Research to date has largely   focused on how changes to prominent interactions (especially seed   dispersal) affect plant species and communities, while concurrent   disruptions to less-studied processes may have opposing effects. With a   particularly limited understanding of non-trophic interactions - such as   physical damage to seedlings by vertebrate trampling, rooting, and   digging - it remains difficult to predict the outcomes of defaunation   for tropical forest plant communities. We established 1800 artificial   seedlings in 18 intact and disturbed sites across the three main   tropical forest regions - the Neotropics (Peru), the Afrotropics (Gabon)   and the Indo-Malayan tropics (Malaysian Borneo) - to isolate non-trophic   vertebrate physical damage from other causes of seedling mortality   (herbivory, pathogens, abiotic desiccation, etc.), and to understand its   effects in intact and anthropogenically-disturbed forests. We found that   vertebrate physical damage is a consistent force in forests across the   tropics, and that hunting significantly alters its strength, with a   similar to 70\% decrease in damage in hunted vs. intact sites that   resulted in a similar to 3.5-fold (350\%) increase in artificial   seedling survival. Our results reveal an understudied mechanism that may   contribute to changes in seedling survival, stem density, and plant   community composition in tropical forests subjected to hunting.

We address the   basic question: are these outbreaks truly unprecedented and a threat to   ecosystem continuity? In order to evaluate this question we (1) present   evidence that the current outbreak is outside the historic range of   variability; (2) examine system resiliency to MPB disturbance based on   adaptation to disturbance and host defenses to MPB attack; and (3)   investigate the potential domain of attraction to large-scale MPB   disturbance based on thermal developmental thresholds, spatial structure   of forest types, and the confounding influence of an introduced   pathogen.

Our model takes a   semi-discrete form, and is composed of a continuous time within-season   part, similar to a dynamic model of energy allocation, and of a discrete   time part, depicting the between seasons reproduction and mortality   processes. We showed that the optimal foraging-reproduction strategies   of the consumers may be ``determinate'' or ``indeterminate''   depending on the season length. More surprisingly, it depended on the   consumers population density as well, with large densities promoting   indeterminacy. A bifurcation analysis showed that the long-term dynamics   produced by this model were quite rich, ranging from both populations'   extinction, coexistence at some season-to-season equilibrium or on   (quasi)-periodic motions, to initial condition-dependent dynamics.

However, root exudates had little effect on the   nitrifier community, but reduced nitrification in the rhizosphere. In   contrast, total AMF hyphal length was significantly stimulated by   genistein (r = 0.5252, P < 0.01). There was a trend that AMF spore   density increased in the rhizosphere with increasing years of   mono-cropping, while AMF infection was constant over time, which might   be attributed to competition between AMF and soil-borne fungal   pathogens, as the results of stimulatory effect of flavonoids on fungal   community, especially fungal pathogens. Our results suggested that the   yield reduction in the beginning of continuous soybean monoculture could   be partially attributed to nitrogen availability and yield stabilization   after few years to stimulatory effects on AMF. These results imply that   some of plant root exudates play a crucial role in changing the soil   microbial community, and that underground ecosystem functioning is also   affected by interactions among microbial functional groups.",1619,NO,SL,,,

The three systems all complied with regulations for organic production,   but varied in external nutrient input and N-recycling, and were compared   to a conventionally farmed control. One organic system (O3) included an   intercropped strip of green manure between crop rows. Oviposition by D.   radicum was generally not reduced in organic cropping systems. However,   higher pupae/egg ratios were observed in the conventional compared to   all organic systems, indicating that immature survival from oviposition   to pupation was reduced under all the three organic farming practices.   In organic system O2 most small coleopteran predators were recorded, but   predation on fly eggs was not significantly higher in organic   treatments. Pupal parasitization rates ranged from 26.5\% to 59.5\%, but   no significant differences among farming systems were found. Although   reduced D. radicum survival could not be attributed solely to natural   enemies, the results indicated that organic farming practices in general   contribute to the suppression of belowground pests in cabbage   production.

This unprecedented event   spanned 3 yr, affected 40 km(2) of sea-grass and resulted in more than a   decade of ecological disturbances. Initial putative causes for seagrass   die-off ranged from climatic anomalies and watershed changes to wasting   disease and eutrophication. Subsequent experimental research suggested   that hypoxic plant tissue, caused by low water column oxygen content or   reduced photosynthesis, allowed intrusion of sulfide leading to plant   death. Contributing factors included high temperatures, salinities and   T. testudinum bio-mass, together causing lower oxygen water solubility,   higher community respiration rates and elevated nighttime oxygen demand.   The Fisheries Habitat Assessment Program (FHAP) has tracked the system's   slow recovery since 1995. Recent FHAP data (2012) indicated that T.   testudinum had returned to pre-die-off densities in even the most   severely affected locations. During the summer of 2015, following   several months of drought, National Park Service researchers reported   hyper-saline conditions and a recurrence of seagrass die-off in   north-central Florida Bay. An interagency effort is presently underway   to document the duration, extent, impacts and possible factors   responsible for the current mortality. Initial field surveys indicate   that there is high spatial coincidence between the current and the   1987-1990 events and that hypersalinity, water column stratification and   bottom-water anoxia might have once again resulted in mass mortality of   T. testudinum in Florida Bay. The goal of this report is to alert the   scientific community to the recurrence of this important ecological   event.",1621,NO,SL,,,

Resource availability is a particularly dynamic and potent   environmental driver of within-host infection dynamics (temporal   patterns of growth, reproduction, parasite production and survival). We   developed, parameterised and validated a model for resource-explicit   infection dynamics by incorporating a parasitism module into dynamic   energy budget theory. The model mechanistically explained the dynamic   multivariate responses of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni and its   intermediate host snail to variation in resources and host density. At   the population level, feedbacks mediated by resource competition could   create a unimodal relationship between snail density and human risk of   exposure to schistosomes. Consequently, weak snail control could   backfire if reductions in snail density release remaining hosts from   resource competition. If resource competition is strong and relevant to   schistosome production in nature, it could inform control strategies.",1622,NO,SL,,,

Natural enemies could help suppress grain aphid and reduce   unnecessary insecticide inputs, but few studies have estimated the   economic value of natural pest control in this crop-pest system, which   could help inform effective integrated pest management strategies. Based   on a natural enemy exclusion experiment carried out in South East   England, this study used an economic surplus model to estimate the value   of predators and parasitoids to control summer grain aphid in wheat in   this region. Incorporating three levels of spray intensity and three   levels of pest infestation, the annual economic value of natural pest   control service was conservatively estimated to be 0-2.3 pound Million.   Under the medium pest infestation level, a 10\% increase in the   proportion of wheat fields using economic threshold-based spray method   would increase this value by 23\% (0.4 pound Million). 71\% of the value   would benefit wheat growers. A potential rise in insecticide costs due   to resistance development would also enhance the value of natural pest   control. These findings support growing efforts from policy-makers to   promote this ecosystem service in agriculture. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.   All rights reserved.",1623,NO,SL,,,

Previous studies have shown that some PAC members are   pathogenic, others suppress oomycete root pathogens and some have no   obvious effect on their Norway spruce (Picea abies) host. The activity   of 85 PAC isolates against Phytophthora citricola s.l. was investigated   by co-culture on plates. We identified a strain of Phialocephala   europaea that significantly reduced the growth of P. citricola in vitro.   Characterization of its extracellular metabolites resulted in the   identification of four major compounds, sclerin, sclerolide, sclerotinin   A, and sclerotinin B. These compounds are known for their positive as   well as negative effects on plant growth. We found that sclerin and   sclerotinin inhibited the growth of P. citricola in vitro at 150 mu g   ml(-1) (similar to 1 mM). This is the first report of their production   by Phialocephala and of activity of these compounds against an oomycete.   Therefore, our data suggest that some PAC might reduce disease resulting   from P. citricola by the production of antibiotics and plant growth   promoting metabolites.

The question of why such genes are   frequently mobile has received increasing attention. Here, we use an   explicit population genetic approach to model the evolution of   plasmid-borne bacterial public goods production. Our findings highlight   the importance of both transmission and relatedness as factors driving   the evolution of plasmid-borne public goods production. We partition the   effects of plasmid transfer of social traits into those of infectivity   and the effect of increased relatedness. Our results demonstrate that,   owing to its effect on relatedness, plasmid mobility increases the   invasion and stability of public goods, in a way not seen in   individually beneficial traits. In addition, we show that plasmid   transfer increases relatedness when public goods production is rare but   this effect declines when production is common, with both scenarios   leading to an increase in the frequency of plasmid-borne public goods.   Plasmids remain important vectors for the spread of social genes   involved in bacterial virulence thus an understanding of their dynamics   is highly relevant from a public health perspective.",1625,NO,SL,,,

While the effects of fungal endophyte   infection on fescue physiology and ecology have been relatively well   studied, less attention has been given to how this relationship may   impact the soil microbial community. We used high-throughput DNA   sequencing and phospholipid fatty acid analysis to determine the   structure and biomass of microbial communities in both bulk and   rhizosphere soils from tall fescue stands that were either uninfected   with E. coenophiala or were infected with the common toxic strain or one   of several novel strains of the endophyte. We found that rhizosphere and   bulk soils harbored distinct microbial communities. Endophyte presence,   regardless of strain, significantly influenced soil fungal communities,   but endophyte effects were less pronounced in prokaryotic communities.   E. coenophiala presence did not change total fungal biomass but caused a   shift in soil and rhizosphere fungal community composition, increasing   the relative abundance of taxa within the Glomeromycota phylum and   decreasing the relative abundance of genera in the Ascomycota phylum,   including Lecanicillium, Volutella, Lipomyces, Pochonia, and   Rhizoctonia.

We identified zones of high and low   cholera prevalence and evaluated the effects of land use on water   quality at different scales. Production functions were used to evaluate   relationships between water quality and public health. Additionally,   using mitigation and defensive costs methods and a combined regression   model, we estimated a marginal value per hectare of forest in avoiding   public health costs associated with contaminated water. Prevalence of   cholera was associated with E. coli. concentrations in streams. Primary   forest cover was the land use most strongly correlated with E. coli.,   particularly within riparian corridors of 100 m width. Our results   suggest a value of water quality regulation of at least \$US 90 ha(-1)   in riparian corridors.

Cool-season grasses can be simultaneously infected by foliar fungal   endophytes and colonised by mycorrhizal fungi, the integrated functions   of which are strong predictors of plant fitness within grassland   ecosystems. Evidence has been presented previously that infection of   grass species with foliar endophytes can negatively affect mycorrhizal   colonisation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mycorrhizal   colonisation in turn adversely affects Neotyphodium endophyte   concentrations and that the competitive interaction between the two   endosymbionts is affected by resource supply.   2. Specifically, we report how competition between Glomus (G. mosseae -   GM, G. intraradices GI) mycorrhizal fungi and N. lolii (common strain   (CS) and AR1) foliar endophytic strains is affected by P supply and   water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content in two Lolium perenne   (perennial ryegrass) cultivars: a high sugar grass, AberDart, and a   conventional (control) grass, Fennema.   3. The presence of Glomus mycorrhizae reduced the concentrations of   endophytes and alkaloids in leaf blades and pseudostems. The reduction   depended on P supply, ryegrass cultivar (notably WSC content) and   endophyte strain. Conversely, foliar endophyte infection reduced   mycorrhizal colonisation rates and concentrations in the roots of the   control cultivar Fennema, although not in the high sugar cultivar,   AberDart.   4. Neither GM nor N. lolii infection had an effect per se on the yield   of root or blade compared with mycorrhiza-free (M-) and endophyte-free   (E-) plants, respectively; though, yield of roots and blades was reduced   by GI infection and at low P.   5. Competitive interactions between ecologically widespread foliar   endophytes (valuable for plant protection) and mycorrhizal endosymbionts   (valuable for P acquisition) as seen in this study are of critical   importance especially in areas of high pest prevalence and low P   availability. Our work stresses the need for elucidating the   physiological/metabolic basis for such interactions between   endosymbionts to understand how these processes contribute to plant   performance and fitness in grassland ecosystems.",1628,NO,SL,,,
