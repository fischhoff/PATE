Male, Celine Leroy, Julien Grangier, Thierry Otto, Angelique Quilichini, Alain Dejean",2011,Dynamics of the association between a long-lived understory myrmecophyte   and its specific associated ants,OECOLOGIA,369-376,369-376,10.1007/s00442-010-1739-5,"Myrmecophytic symbioses are widespread in tropical ecosystems and their   diversity makes them useful tools for understanding the origin and   evolution of mutualisms. Obligate ant-plants, or myrmecophytes, provide   a nesting place, and, often, food to a limited number of plant-ant   species. In exchange, plant-ants protect their host plants from   herbivores, competitors and pathogens, and can provide them with   nutrients. Although most studies to date have highlighted a similar   global pattern of interactions in these systems, little is known about   the temporal structuring and dynamics of most of these associations. In   this study we focused on the association between the understory   myrmecophyte Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae) and its obligate ant   partner Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae). An examination of the   life histories and growth rates of both partners demonstrated that this   plant species has a much longer lifespan (up to about 350 years) than   its associated ant colonies (up to about 21 years). The size of the ant   colonies and their reproductive success were strongly limited by the   available nesting space provided by the host plants. Moreover, the   resident ants positively affected the vegetative growth of their host   plant, but had a negative effect on its reproduction by reducing the   number of flowers and fruits by more than 50\%. Altogether our results   are important to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of ant-plant   symbioses. The highly specialized interaction between long-lived plants   and ants with a shorter lifespan produces an asymmetry in the   evolutionary rates of the interaction which, in return, can affect the   degree to which the interests of the two partners converge.",544,NO,SH,,,

Differences in foraging costs and hunting   success are therefore likely to affect habitat choice. In a previous   study, we showed that African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) packs with   territories inside Hwange National Park (HNP), over the course of   several years, moved their territories into the buffer zone outside HNP,   where reproductive success was higher but anthropogenic mortality   exceeded natality. In this study, based on long-term radio-telemetry   data from 22 African wild dog packs, we analysed whether differences in   foraging costs and hunting success could have contributed to this   territorial drift. Taking seasonality and pack size into account, we   determined foraging costs (foraging distance and chase distance) and   hunting success (successful or failed chase) inside and outside HNP.   Although we observed no difference in foraging costs, hunting success   was higher outside HNP, which is likely to have contributed to the   territorial drift into the buffer zone outside the protected area. This   study shows the importance of taking factors affecting hunting success   into account in the conservation strategy of African wild dogs.",545,NO,SH,,,

Here we describe research to understand the dynamics of lake food   webs in relation to a native riparian amphibian and its interaction with   introduced trout. The mountain yellow-legged frog Rana muscosa is   endemic to alpine watersheds of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the   Transverse Ranges of California, but it has declined to a small fraction   of its historical distribution and abundance. Although remaining frogs   and introduced trout feed in different habitats of alpine lakes, our   stable-isotope analyses clearly show that the same resource base of   benthic invertebrates sustains their growth. During one period, insect   emergence from naturally fishless lakes was nearly 20-fold higher   compared to adjacent lakes with trout, showing that fish reduce   availability of aquatic prey to amphibious and terrestrial consumers.   Although trout cannot prey on adult frogs due to gape limitation,   foraging post-metamorphic frogs are 10 times more abundant in the   absence of trout, suggesting an important role for competition for prey   by trout in highly unproductive alpine watersheds. Most Sierran lakes   contain fish, and those that do not are usually small isolated ponds; in   our study, these two lake types supported the lowest densities of   post-metamorphic frogs, and these frogs were less reliant on local,   benthic sources of productivity. Since Rana muscosa was formerly the   most abundant vertebrate in the Sierra Nevada, the reduction in energy   flow from lake benthos to this consumer due to fish introductions may   have had negative consequences for its numerous terrestrial predators,   many of which have also declined. We suggest that disruptions of trophic   connections between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are an important   but poorly understood consequence of fish introduction to many thousands   of montane lakes and streams worldwide and may contribute to declines of   native consumers in riparian habitats.",546,NO,SH,,,

Raptors occupy a diverse array of habitats   worldwide and are important to ecosystems for their role as   opportunistic predators. We documented initial (primary) WNV infection   and then regularly measured WNV-specific neutralizing antibody titers in   16 resident raptors of seven species, plus one turkey vulture. Most   individuals were initially infected and seroconverted between July and   September of 2003, though three birds remained seronegative until summer   2006. Many of these birds became clinically ill upon primary infection,   with clinical signs ranging from loss of appetite to moderate   neurological disease. Naturally induced WNV neutralizing antibody titers   remained essentially unchanged in some birds, while eight individuals   experienced secondary rises in titer presumably due to additional   exposures at 1, 2, or 3 years following primary infection. No birds   experienced clinical signs surrounding or following the time of   secondary exposure, and therefore antibodies were considered protective.   Results of this study have implications for transmission dynamics of WNV   and health of raptor populations, as well as the interpretation of   serologic data from free-ranging and captive birds. Antibodies in   raptors surviving WNV may persist for multiple years and protect against   potential adverse effects of subsequent exposures.",547,NO,SH,,,

Lesion   length and disease index were recorded dynamically, and the chlorophyll   content, photosynthetic parameters and final dry matter accumulation   were measured after a 4-week period of disease. Infection by B. graminis   significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the chlorophyll content, net   photosynthetic rate, intercellular carbon dioxide concentration and dry   matter at some soil water contents. Presence of the endophyte lowered   the disease index while significantly (P < 0.05) increasing the   chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate. The endophyte also   positively affected the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration. In   addition, it increased the dry matter accumulation per host plant under   pathogen stress. The study demonstrated that while powdery mildew   depresses the photosynthetic parameters of A. inebrians, the presence of   the Epichloe endophyte can reduce the damage caused by the pathogen.

Inactivation due to   biotic stressors is one of the processes that govern the removal of   faecal microorganisms in these systems. One such stress is the possible   production of antimicrobial compounds by plants growing in sustainable   stormwater treatment systems, potentially enhancing the removal of   faecal pathogens. To this end, this study has investigated the   antimicrobial potential of 17 Australian native plant species that are   suitable for application in these systems but have not been tested for   their antimicrobial activity within their seed exudates, seed extracts   and/or seedling extracts. The extracts and exudates were tested using   the agar well diffusion method. Nine of the selected plant species   inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli. Among of the antibacterial   plants, Melaleuca ericifolia, which has been previously applied in   stormwater treatment systems, can be a suitable candidate for further   study as it demonstrated antibacterial activity within all tested   components. This species should be utilised in stormwater treatment   facilities due to its effective nitrogen uptake, maintenance of   hydraulic conductivity, and due to its potential effectiveness at   inactivating microbial pathogens.

Describing and explaining the structure of species interaction   networks is of paramount importance for community ecology. Yet much has   to be learned about the mechanisms responsible for major patterns, such   as nestedness and modularity in different kinds of systems, of which   large and diverse networks are a still underrepresented and scarcely   studied fraction. 2. We assembled information on fishes and their   parasites living in a large floodplain of key ecological importance for   freshwater ecosystems in the Parana River basin in South America. The   resulting fishparasite network containing 72 and 324 species of fishes   and parasites, respectively, was analysed to investigate the patterns of   nestedness and modularity as related to fish and parasite features. 3.   Nestedness was found in the entire network and among endoparasites,   multiple-host life cycle parasites and native hosts, but not in networks   of ectoparasites, single-host life cycle parasites and non-native   fishes. All networks were significantly modular. Taxonomy was the major   hosts attribute influencing both nestedness and modularity: more closely   related host species tended to be associated with more nested parasite   compositions and had greater chance of belonging to the same network   module. Nevertheless, host abundance had a positive relationship with   nestedness when only native host species pairs of the same network   module were considered for analysis. 4. These results highlight the   importance of evolutionary history of hosts in linking patterns of   nestedness and formation of modules in the network. They also show that   functional attributes of parasites (i.e. parasitism mode and life cycle)   and origin of host populations (i.e. natives versus non-natives) are   crucial to define the relative contribution of these two network   properties and their dependence on other ecological factors (e.g. host   abundance), with potential implications for community dynamics and   stability.",550,MAYBE,SH,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

This process, named rhizodeposition, is of   ecological importance because (1) it is a loss of reduced C for the   plant, (2) it is an input flux for the organic C pool of the soil and   (3) it fuels the soil microflora, which is involved in the great   majority of the biological activity of soils such as the nutrient and   pollutant cycling or the dynamics of soil borne pathogens, for example.   The present review first examines the mechanisms by which major   rhizodeposits are released into the soil: production of root cap cells,   secretion of mucilage, passive and controlled diffusion of root   exudates. In a second part, results from tracer studies (43 articles)   are analysed and values of C flux from the plant root into the soil are   summarized. In average, 17\% of the net C fixed by photosynthesis is   lost by roots and recovered as rhizosphere respiration (12\%) and soil   residues (5\%). which corresponds to 50\% of the C exported by shoots to   belowground. Finally, the paper reviews major factors that modify the   partitioning of photoassimilates to the soil: microorganisms, nitrogen,   soil texture and atmospheric CO2 concentration.",551,NO,SH,,,

However, accurate impact assessments comprising larger spatial   scales are lacking to date although these are critically needed given   the expected disturbance intensification under a warming climate. Hence,   our quantitative knowledge on current and future BD impacts, for   example, on forest carbon (C) cycling, is strongly limited. We extended   a dynamic global vegetation model to simulate ecosystem response to   prescribed tree mortality and defoliation due to multiple biotic agents   across United States forests during the period 1997-2015, and quantified   the BD-induced vegetation C loss, that is, C fluxes from live vegetation   to dead organic matter pools. Annual disturbance fractions separated by   BD type (tree mortality and defoliation) and agent (bark beetles,   defoliator insects, other insects, pathogens, and other biotic agents)   were calculated at 0.5 degrees resolution from aerial-surveyed data and   applied within the model. Simulated BD-induced C fluxes totaled 251.6 Mt   C (annual mean: 13.2 Mt C year(-1), SD +/- 7.3 Mt C year(-1) between   years) across the study domain, to which tree mortality contributed 95\%   and defoliation 5\%. Among BD agents, bark beetles caused most C fluxes   (61\%), and total insect-induced C fluxes were about five times larger   compared to non-insect agents, for example, pathogens and wildlife. Our   findings further demonstrate that BD-induced C cycle impacts (i)   displayed high spatio-temporal variability, (ii) were dominated by   different agents across BD types and regions, and (iii) were comparable   in magnitude to fire-induced impacts. This study provides the first   ecosystem model-based assessment of BD-induced impacts on forest C   cycling at the continental scale and going beyond single agent-host   systems, thus allowing for comparisons across regions, BD types, and   agents. Ultimately, a perspective on the potential and limitations of a   more process-based incorporation of multiple BDs in ecosystem models is   offered.",552,NO,SH,,,

We present a general framework for modelling FIP disturbances   through their impacts on tree ecophysiology. Five pathways are   identified as the basis for functional groupings: increases in leaf,   stem and root turnover, and reductions in phloem and xylem transport. A   simple ecophysiological model was used to explore the sensitivity of   forest growth, mortality and ecosystem fluxes to varying outbreak   severity. Across all pathways, low infection was associated with growth   reduction but limited mortality. Moderate infection led to individual   tree mortality, whereas high levels led to stand-level die-offs delayed   over multiple years. Delayed mortality is consistent with observations   and critical for capturing biophysical, biogeochemical and successional   responses. This framework enables novel predictions under present and   future global change scenarios.",553,NO,SH,,,

Ecological consequences of the   technocentric approaches, and their sustainability and impacts on human   health have, however, not received adequate attention particularly in   developing countries. India is one country that has undergone a rapid   transformation in the field of agriculture by adopting strategies of the   Green Revolution. This article provides a comparative analysis of the   effects of older and newer paradigms of agricultural practices on   ecosystem and human health within the larger context of sustainability.   The study was conducted in three closely situated areas where different   agricultural practices were followed: (a) the head-end of a modern   canal-irrigated area, (b) an adjacent dryland, and (c) an area (the   ancient area) that has been provided with irrigation for some 800 years.   Data were collected by in-depth interviews of individual farmers,   focus-group discussions, participatory observations, and from secondary   sources. The dryland, receiving limited rainfall, continues to practice   diverse cropping centered to a large extent on traditional coarse   cereals and uses only small amounts of chemical inputs. On the other   hand, modern agriculture in the head-end emphasizes continuous cropping   of rice supported by extensive and indiscriminate use of agrochemicals.   Market forces have, to a significant degree, influenced the ancient area   to abandon much of its early practices of organic farming and to take up   aspects of modern agricultural practice. Rice cultivation in the   irrigated parts has changed the local landscape and vegetation and has   augmented the mosquito population, which is a potential vector for   malaria, Japanese encephalitis and other diseases. Nevertheless, despite   these problems, perceptions of adverse environmental effects are lowest   in the heavily irrigated area.",554,NO,SH,,,

The loss of amphibians could affect   communities of aquatic insects co-occurring in these streams in various   ways. We examined patterns of species and genetic diversity of these   communities and their evolutionary history along the chytrid expansion   gradient to elucidate potential community responses.   LocationSix streams over a 320-km transect in Panama affected by chytrid   expansion from west to east for up to 14years, and two apparently   chytrid-free streams in the east.   MethodsPatterns of - and -diversity were investigated at three   hierarchical levels: genus, species and haplotypes. Genus identification   was based on morphology, and putative species were inferred by grouping   the DNA barcodes (749 cox1 sequences) with the GMYC method on all   collected individuals of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and   Plecoptera.   ResultsA total of 96 genera in 43 families (9 orders) of insects were   encountered. Genus-level -diversity was higher in the easternmost   streams, possibly due to a separate biogeographical history, whereas   -diversity was constant along the chytrid expansion gradient. Community   DNA barcoding resulted in 426 cox1 haplotypes and 154 putative species,   most of them limited to single sites. High -diversity along the gradient   at both species and haplotype levels argues against community   homogenization by migration in the wake of amphibian declines. In   contrast, phylo--diversity was low, indicating community similarity at   deep levels.   Main conclusionsAquatic insect communities in this region are influenced   by long-term limited dispersion that generated high endemicity. The   pattern persists mostly unperturbed after disease-driven amphibian   declines; hence, if indeed insects fill the niches vacated by tadpoles,   they would originate from local communities rather than immigration.   Given the unique evolutionary history and physical isolation of local   assemblages, the ecosystem deterioration carries the risk of losing   unique diversity.",555,YES,SH,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

We artificially inoculated the endophyte into mature tillers   of endophyte-free A. sibiricum. Plants were clipped to 5 cm height after   recording growth traits, and analyzed for total nonstructural   carbohydrates (TNC \%), the percentage of nitrogen (N \%), and carbon (C   \%) in leaves before and after clipping. In our study, the prominent   host genotype-endophyte infection interactions detected in A. sibiricum   indicates that, for many growth and storage traits, endophyte infection   can impact a little change. However, there is no overriding consistently   positive effect of the endophyte on growth or storage in A. sibiricum   before or after clipping. Our study showed that the interaction between   endophyte and host grasses was highly contingent on plant genotypes. We   found host genotype overrode fungal endophyte infection in influencing   tiller number and photosynthetic properties of A. sibiricum before   clipping. After clipping, host genotype accounted for more of the   variation in regrowth and above-ground biomass of A. sibiricum than   endophyte infection. Our study showed that host genotype affected the   total nonstructural carbohydrates of A. sibiricum before and after   clipping, whereas endophyte infection increased the carbon content after   clipping. Genotype by infection interactions for plant height, leaf   mass, total nonstructural carbohydrates, and photosynthetic   characteristics indicated genotype-specific effects of endophytes on A.   sibiricum physiology and photosynthetic capacity. The host   genotype-endophyte infection interactions detected in A. sibiricum   suggest that host genotype overrides fungal endophyte infection on   growth, physiology, and nutrient content of this native grass.

There was evidence   of an asymptotic relationship between energy flowing through a food   chain and parasite diversity, although there were clear outliers. High   parasite diversity was associated with host taxa which were highly   connected within the food web.

The 100th anniversary   of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to   reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward   to high-light priorities for future work.   2. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental   importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists   working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754   questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388   participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of   discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done   during a two-day workshop and thereafter.   3. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and   technical pre-occupations of ecology.

This could result either from complementarity among consumers or the   inclusion of particular key species, and it is often difficult to   differentiate between these two mechanisms. We exploited a simple plant   mutation (reduced production of surface waxes) to alter foraging within   a community of aphid predators, and thus perhaps shift the nature of   resulting predator diversity effects. We found that greater predator   species richness dramatically increased prey suppression and plant   biomass only on mutant, reduced-wax pea plants (Pisum sativum). On pea   plants from a sister line with wild type, waxier plant surfaces,   predator species richness did not influence predators' impacts on   herbivores or plants. Thus, a change in plant surface structure acted to   turn on, or off, the cascading effects of predator diversity. Greater   predator richness encouraged higher densities of true predators but did   not lead to greater reproduction by a parasitoid, Aphidius ervi;   fecundity of each natural enemy species was similar for the two plant   types. Behavioral observations indicated that although A. ervi was less   likely to forage within species-rich predator communities, low-wax   plants mitigated this interference by encouraging generally greater A.   ervi foraging and thus high rates of aphid dislodgement (aphids dropped   from plants to escape A. ervi, but not the other predators). Thus, only   species-rich, low-wax plants simultaneously encouraged strong   species-specific effects of A. ervi, and strong complementarity among   the other predator species. In summary, our study provides evidence that   diversity effects in predator assemblages are sensitive to habitat   characteristics. Further, we show that a simple plant morphological   trait, controlled by a single gene mutation, can dramatically alter the   cascading effects of predator species richness on herbivores and plants.",560,NO,SH,,,

Specialist parasites   can modify predator behavior, yet rarely have cascading effects on   multiple predator species and prey been evaluated. We examined   influences of specialist phorid parasites (Pseudacteon spp.) on three   predatory ant species and herbivores in a coffee agroecosystem.   Specifically, we examined whether changes in ant richness affected fruit   damage by the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and whether   phorids altered multi-predator effects. Each ant species reduced borer   damage, and without phorids, increasing predator richness did not   further decrease borer damage. However, with phorids, activity of one   ant species was reduced, indicating that the presence of multiple ant   species was necessary to limit borer damage. In addition, phorid   presence revealed synergistic effects of multiple ant species, not   observed without the presence of this parasite.

Seabirds are particularly interesting hosts in this   respect. In addition to incredible long-distance movements during   migration, foraging and prospecting, these birds are long-lived, site   faithful and breed in dense aggregations in specific colony locations.   These different characteristics can favor both the local maintenance and   large-scale dissemination of parasites and pathogens. The Iles Eparses   provide breeding and feeding grounds for more than 3 million breeding   pairs of seabirds including at least 13 species. Breeding colonies on   these islands are relatively undisturbed by human activities and   represent natural metapopulations in which seabird population dynamics,   movement and dispersal can be studied in relation to that of circulating   parasites and pathogens. In this review, we summarize previous knowledge   and recently-acquired data on the parasites and pathogens found in   association with seabirds of the Iles Eparses. These studies have   revealed the presence of a rich diversity of infectious agents (viruses,   bacteria and parasites) carried by the birds and/or their local   ectoparasites (ticks and louse flies). Many of these agents are   widespread and found in other ecosystems confirming a role for seabirds   in their large scale dissemination and maintenance. The heterogeneous   distribution of parasites and infectious agents among islands and   seabird species suggests that relatively independent metacommunities of   interacting species may exist within the western Indian Ocean. In this   context, we discuss how the patterns and determinants of seabird   movements may alter parasite and pathogen circulation. We conclude by   outlining key aspects for future research given the baseline data now   available and current concerns in eco-epidemiology and biodiversity   conservation.

We compared three site-level replicates of each treatment   to three high-quality remnant wetland prairies.

Wetlands with topsoil removed had   similar diversity to remnants, but lower productivity, soil carbon and   nitrogen, microbial biomass, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal infection   rates. Solarization sites had the highest native cover, but diversity   was approximately half that of remnant wetlands. We attribute this to   both a priority effect of seeded native perennial bunchgrasses   establishing early in the restoration process and competitively   excluding other species, and to a lack of microtopographic variation in   the restored sites. Our results suggest that restoration projects should   evaluate both structural and functional processes, since they may reveal   tradeoffs among important goals.

Agriculture benefits from ecosystem services provided by mobile   agents, such as biological pest control by natural enemies and   pollination by bees.

Here we propose a generic statistical model to derive kernel   functions to characterize the spatial distribution of ecosystem services   provided by mobile agents. The model is similar in spirit to a   generalized linear model, and uses data of landscape composition and   ecosystem services assessed at target sites to estimate parameters of   the kernel. The approach is tested in a simulation study and illustrated   by an empirical case study on parasitism rates of the diamondback moth   Plutella xylostella.   3. The simulation study shows that the scale parameter of the   exponential power kernel can be estimated with limited bias, whereas   estimation of the shape parameter is difficult. For the case study the   model provides biologically relevant estimates for the kernel associated   with parasitism of P. xylostella. These estimates can be used to   generate ecosystem service maps for existing or planned landscapes. The   case study reveals that predictions can be sensitive to the parameter   values for the width and shape of the kernel, and to the link function   used in the statistical model.   4. In the last two decades numerous empirical studies assessed ecosystem   services at target sites and related these to the surrounding landscape.

Thorough documentation of   social interactions is crucial to study the causes and consequences of   sociality in gregarious animals. Wireless digital transceivers represent   a promising tool to revolutionize data collection for the study of   social interactions in terms of the degree of automation, data quantity,   and quality. Unfortunately, devices for automated proximity sensing via   direct communication among animal-borne sensors are usually heavy and do   not allow for the investigation of small animal species, which represent   the majority of avian and mammalian taxa. We present a lightweight   animal-borne sensor node that is built from commercially available   components and uses a sophisticated scheme for energy-efficient   communication, with high sampling rates at relatively low power   consumption. We demonstrate the basic functionality of the sensor node   under laboratory conditions and its applicability for the study of   social interactions among free-ranging animals. The first field tests   were performed on two species of bats in temperate and tropical   ecosystems. At <2g, this sensor node is light enough to observe a broad   spectrum of taxa including small vertebrates. Given our specifications,   the system was especially sensitive to changes in distance within the   short range (up to a distance of 4m between tags). High spatial   resolution at short distances enables the evaluation of interactions   among individuals at a fine scale and the investigation of close   contacts. This technology opens new avenues of research, allowing   detailed investigation of events associated with social contact, such as   mating behavior, pathogen transmission, social learning, and resource   sharing. Social behavior that is not easily observed becomes observable,   for example, in animals living in burrows or in nocturnal animals. A   switch from traditional methods to the application of digital   transceiver chips in proximity sensing offers numerous advantages in   addition to an enormous increase in data quality and quantity. For   future applications, the platform allows for the integration of   additional sensors that may collect physiological or environmental data.

In this study, we asked whether these factors also predict diversity and   turnover in parasite communities. We studied communities of avian   malaria in two sympatric, ecologically similar, congeneric host species   at three different sites. We asked whether parasite prevalence and   community structure varied with host population, host phylogeography or   geographical distance. We used PCR to screen birds for infections and   then used Bayesian methods to determine phylogenetic relationships among   malaria strains. Metrics of both community and phylogenetic beta   diversity were used to examine patterns of malaria strain turnover   between host populations, and partial Mantel tests were used determine   the correlation between malaria beta diversity and geographical   distance. Finally, we developed microsatellite markers to describe the   genetic structure of host populations and assess the relationship   between host phylogeography and parasite beta diversity. We found that   different genera of malaria parasites infect the two hosts at different   rates. Within hosts, parasite communities in one population were   phylogenetically clustered, but there was otherwise no correlation   between metrics of parasite beta diversity and geographical or genetic   distance between host populations. Patterns of parasite turnover among   host populations are consistent with malaria transmission occurring in   the winter rather than on the breeding grounds. Our results indicate   greater turnover in parasite communities between different hosts than   between different study sites. Differences in host species, as well as   transmission location and vector ecology, seem to be more important in   structuring malaria communities than the distance-decay relationships   frequently found in macroorganisms. Determining the factors affecting   parasite community diversity and turnover has wide-ranging implications   for understanding the selective pressures shaping host ecology and   ecosystem structure.

Here, we evaluate the response of Barbarea vulgaris, a wild crucifer, to   combined attack by an oomycete Albugo sp., a plant pathogen causing   white rust, and a flea beetle, Phyllotreta nemorum. Plants from two B.   vulgaris types that differ in resistance to P. nemorum were exposed to   Albugo and P. nemorum alone and in combination and then monitored for   pathogen infection, herbivore damage, defence compounds, nutritional   quality, biomass and seed production. Albugo developed infections in the   insect-resistant plants, whereas insect-susceptible plants were scarcely   infected. Concentrations of Albugo DNA were higher in plants also   exposed to herbivory; similarly, flea beetle larvae caused more damage   on Albugo-infected plants. Concentrations of saponins and glucosinolates   strongly increased when the plants were exposed to P. nemorum and when   the insect-susceptible plants were exposed to Albugo, and some of these   compounds increased even more in the combined treatment. The biomass of   young insect-susceptible plants was lower following exposure to flea   beetles, and the number of leaves of both plant types was negatively   affected by combined exposure. After flowering, however, adult plants   produced similar numbers of viable seeds, irrespective of treatment. Our   findings support the concept that pathogens and herbivores can affect   each other's performance on a host plant and that the plant reacts by   inducing specific and general defences.

The   use of amendments, such as the incorporation of compost into the soil,   strongly affects soil microbial communities directly or indirectly. The   use of compost can be an important tool to control soil-borne pathogens.   Certain groups of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) present in compost   produce metabolites, such as siderophores and antibiotics, with specific   suppressive activity against soilborne pathogens: among these compost   bacteria, species of Pseudomonas and Bacillus are very important. In   this study, we investigated the effects of increasing doses of compost   on the density of several cultivable soil microbial groups in an   agricultural system of Southern Italy. The number of total bacteria,   total fungi, siderophore-producing bacteria (principally Pseudomonas   spp.) and spore-forming bacteria (principally Bacillus spp.) was   evaluated over a period of five months.

The number of total bacteria and   siderophore-producing bacteria was greater in the soil treated with   compost than in soils treated with mineral fertilization or not manured,   with an increase related to the dose of compost applied.

These results show that compost   from the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes furnishes a high   number of spore-forming bacteria exhibiting antibiotic activity against   phytopathogenic fungi. The application of compost can change the   composition of the soil microbial community, modifying the relationships   among microorganisms, both competitive and/or antagonistic, producing a   decrease in the activity of plant pathogens.

Recent extreme weather events affecting the   Great Barrier Reef, that is, consecutive cyclones and the 2016 El Nino   event, allowed us to explore potential consequences in the mutualistic   interactions involving cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus (hereafter   ``cleaner''). After the perturbations, cleaner densities were reduced   by 80\%, disproportionally compared to the variety of reef fish clients   from which cleaners remove ectoparasites. Consequently, shifts in supply   and demand yielded an increase in the clients' demand for cleaning.   Therefore, clients became less selective toward cleaners, whereas   cleaners were able to choose from a multitude of partners. In parallel,   we found a significant decline in the ability of cleaners to manage   their reputation and to learn to prioritize ephemeral food sources to   maximize food intake in laboratory experiments. In other words, cleaners   failed to display the previously documented strategic sophistication   that made this species a prime example for fish intelligence. In   conclusion, low population densities may cause various effects on   individual behavior, and as a consequence, interspecific interactions.

It is currently unknown how intraspecific variation in   PSFs interacts with the environment (e.g., nutrient availability) to   influence competition between native and invasive plants. We conducted a   fully crossed multi-factor greenhouse experiment to determine the   effects of Phragmites australis rhizosphere soil biota, interspecific   competition, and nutrient availability on biomass of replicate   populations from one native and two invasive lineages of common reed   (P.australis) and a single lineage of native smooth cordgrass (Spartina   alterniflora). Harmful soil biota consistently dominated PSFs involving   all three P.australis lineages, reducing biomass by 10\%. Indirect PSFs   (i.e., soil biota spillover) from the two invasive P.australis lineages   reduced S.alterniflora biomass by 7\%, whereas PSFs from the native   P.australis lineage increased S.alterniflora biomass by 6\%.   Interestingly, interspecific competition and PSFs interacted to weaken   their respective impacts on S.alterniflora, whereas they exerted   synergistic negative effects on P.australis. Phragmitesaustralis soil   biota decreased S.alterniflora biomass when grown alone (i.e., a soil   legacy), but increased S.alterniflora biomass when grown with   P.australis, suggesting that P.australis recruits harmful generalist   soil biota or facilitates S.alterniflora via spillover (i.e., apparent   mutualism). Soil biota also reduced interspecific competition impacts on   S.alterniflora, although it remained competitively inferior to   P.australis across all treatments. Competitive interactions and   responses to nutrients did not differ among P.australis lineages,   indicating that interspecific competition and nutrient deposition may   not be key drivers of P.australis invasion in North America. Although   soil biota, interspecific competition, and nutrient availability appear   to have no direct impact on the success of invasive P.australis lineages   in North America, intraspecific lineage variation in indirect spillover   and soil legacies from P.australis occur and may have important   implications for co-occurring native species and restoration of invaded   habitats.

While no   single textbook can be expected to provide extensive treatment of   conservation-related topics across all biological groups, we outline   three reasons why parasites should feature more prominently in formal   conservation education, and suggest several ways in which greater   incorporation of these parasite topics could strengthen the teaching and   practice of conservation biology.

However, both the diversity and functional roles of these viruses in   fresh waters are still poorly understood. We conducted a year-long study   in 2011 of the community structure of planktonic virus groups in the   upper lit layer of two important freshwater natural ecosystems in   France, Lake Annecy (oligotrophic) and Lake Bourget (oligo-mesotrophic).   Using PCR-DGGE to target a number of different structural and functional   signature genes, i.e.,g20, g23, psbA, polB, and mcp, the phytoplankton   viruses were shown to display temporal and spatial variability. There   were marked seasonal changes in community structure for all viral groups   in Lake Bourget, but only for T4-like myoviruses and psbA-containing   cyanophages in Lake Annecy. The multivariate statistical analyses   revealed that (1) various environmental factors can directly or   indirectly explain the community structure observed for each   phytoplankton viral group, and (2) temporal patterns of T4-like myovirus   community structure were similar between the two lakes. In general, our   results (1) suggest that the observed algal virus patterns were   associated with significant shifts in phytoplankton biomass and/or   structure, which in turn were shaped by the abiotic environment, and (2)   support the Bank model proposed by Breitbart and Rohwer (Trends   Microbiol 13:278-284, 2005).

Given their putative role in   mediating life-history trade-offs, telomeres are also a likely candidate   for maintaining honesty in sexually selected signals; few studies to   date, however, have demonstrated a correlation between sexual signals   and telomere dynamics. Here, we show that plumage coloration in male   common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) is correlated with both   relative telomere length and with the rate of telomere loss between   years. Elevated antioxidant capacity is also associated with reduced   telomere loss, but only among older males. Previous work in this   population has demonstrated that males with brighter plumage are in   better condition, have higher reproductive success, and are more likely   to survive over winter. Thus, the signal attribute associated with mate   choice in this system also conveys reliable information about telomere   dynamics. At present, it is unclear whether telomere maintenance plays a   causal role in maintaining signal honesty or whether the correlation   arises due to underlying variation in individual resources or genotypes.   We suggest that subsequent work should consider the possibility that   fundamental trade-offs between signal investment and cell-level   processes that influence aging and reproductive senescence may provide a   foundation for understanding the maintenance of sexual signal honesty.",578,NO,SH,,,

We   calibrated QuickBird remote sensing imagery with a leaf-level spectral   library of local vegetation. We used this spectral library to determine   diagnostic vegetation indices for differentiating stages of beetle   infestation within the 37 km(2) TCEF watershed. These indices formed the   basis of a three-component mixing model to establish the extent and   magnitude of beetle infestation across the TCEF watershed. We compared   disturbance patterns with spatially distributed topography and   vegetation variables derived from a light detection and ranging-based   digital elevation model of TCEF.

This phenomenal diversity of BGCs coupled with their high   rates of horizontal transfer raise questions about whether they are   really active and beneficial, whether they are neutral and confer no   advantage, or whether they are carried in genomes because they are   parasitic or addictive. We previously reported that Salinispora bacteria   broadly use the desferrioxamine family of siderophores for iron   acquisition. Herein we describe a new and unrelated group of peptidic   siderophores called salinichelins from a restricted number of   Salinispora strains in which the desferrioxamine biosynthesis genes have   been lost. We have reconstructed the evolutionary history of these two   different siderophore families and show that the acquisition and   retention of the new salinichelin siderophores co- occurs with the loss   of the more ancient desferrioxamine pathway. This identical event   occurred at least three times independently during the evolution of the   genus.

This convergence has arisen from a diverse set of   investigations addressing rangeland ecosystem dynamics, disease   transmission, and fluctuations in the populations of insect pests.   Effective application of the threshold concept to ecosystem management   will require development of more robust linkages between non-equilibrium   theory and protocols to identify triggers that initiate threshold   conditions, feedback loops that establish system resilience, and   developmental trajectories and attributes of potential alternative   stable states. Successful implementation of these theory/application   linkages has the potential to underpin an operational framework of   resilience-based ecosystem management that is founded upon the   identification of structural indicators that are correlated with   vulnerability or proximity to thresholds, rather than threshold   identification per se. Several investigations indicate that thresholds   are strongly influenced by scale; multiple cross-scale interactions   demonstrate the need for greater knowledge and analyses to address   scale-dependent processes, i.e., critical scales and scaling laws. This   feature emphasizes the relevance of thresholds and non-equilibrium   dynamics in multiple natural resource management applications and in so   doing demonstrates the need for a more comprehensive and integrated   ecological framework capable of quantitatively assessing dynamics at   multiple scales to inform management and policy recommendations for   optimal management and risk assessment.",581,NO,SH,,,

Several recent studies indicate regional, long-term pollinator   declines, and economic consequences have been derived from declining   pollination efficiencies. However, use of pollinator services as   economic incentives for conservation must consider environmental factors   such as drought, pests, and diseases, which can also limit yields.   Moreover, ``flower excess'' is a well-known reproductive strategy of   plants as insurance against unpredictable, external factors that limit   reproduction. With three case studies on the importance of pollination   levels for amounts of harvested fruits of three tropical crops (passion   fruit in Brazil, coffee in Ecuador, and cacao in Indonesia) we   illustrate how reproductive strategies and environmental stress can   obscure initial benefits from improved pollination. By interpreting   these results with findings from evolutionary sciences, agronomy, and   studies on wild-plant populations, we argue that studies on economic   benefits from pollinators should include the total of ecosystem   processes that (1) lead to successful pollination and (2) mobilize   nutrients and improve plant quality to the extent that crop yields   indeed benefit from enhanced pollinator services.

Theoretical models based on these properties predict a much higher t   frequency than observed, leading to the t paradox. Here, we use   empirical field data and theoretical approaches to investigate whether   polyandry is a female counterstrategy against the negative fitness   consequences of such distorters. We found a significant decrease of the   t frequency over a period of 5.5 years that cannot be explained by the   effect of transmission ratio distortion and recessive lethals, despite   significantly higher life expectancy of +/t females compared to +/+   females. We quantified life-history data and homozygous and heterozygous   fitness effects. Population subdivision and inbreeding were excluded as   evolutionary forces influencing the t system. The possible influence of   polyandry on the t system was then investigated by applying a stochastic   model to this situation.

Fifteen study sites were located in streams within the   Shenandoah River catchment (Virginia, U.S.A.), where widespread nutrient   enrichment has occurred.

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential shifts in spatial   distribution of three tree-line conifer species in the Greater   Yellowstone Ecosystem under three future climate-change scenarios and to   assess their potential sensitivity to changes in both temperature and   precipitation.   Location This study was performed using data from 275 sites within the   boundaries of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, primarily   located in Wyoming, USA.   Methods We used data on tree-line conifer presence from the US Forest   Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. Climatic and edaphic   variables were derived from spatially interpolated maps and approximated   for each of the sites. We used the random-forest prediction method to   build a model of predicted current and future distributions of each of   the species under various climate-change scenarios.   Results We had good success in predicting the distribution of tree-line   conifer species currently and under future climate scenarios.   Temperature and temperature-related variables appeared to be most   influential in the distribution of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis),   whereas precipitation and soil variables dominated the models for   subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea   engelmannii). The model for whitebark pine substantially overpredicted   absences (as compared with the other models), which is probably a result   of the importance of biological factors in the distribution of this   species.   Main conclusions These models demonstrate the complex response of   conifer distributions to changing climate scenarios. Whitebark pine is   considered a `keystone' species in the subalpine forests of western   North America; however, it is believed to be nearly extinct throughout a   substantial portion of its range owing to the combined effects of an   introduced pathogen, outbreaks of the native mountain pine beetle   (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and changing fire regimes. Given predicted   changes in climate, it is reasonable to predict an overall decrease in   pine-dominated subalpine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.   In order to manage these forests effectively with respect to future   climate, it may be important to focus attention on monitoring dry mid-   and high-elevation forests as harbingers of long-term change.",586,NO,SH,,,

Allelopathy has been a controversially debated phenomenon for years,   which revived in plant invasion biology as one possible reason for the   success of invasive plants. Noxious plant exudates may harm other plants   and provide an advantage to the allelopathic plant. However, root   exudates are not always toxic, but may stimulate the microbial community   and change nutrient availability in the rhizosphere. In a greenhouse   experiment, we investigated the interacting effects of activated carbon,   arbuscular mycorrhiza and plant competition between the invasive Senecio   inaequidens and the native Artemisia vulgaris. Furthermore, we tested   whether activated carbon showed any undesired effects by directly   affecting mycorrhiza or soil chemistry. Contrary to the expectation, S.   inaequidens was a weak competitor and we could not support the idea that   allelopathy was involved in the competition. Activated carbon led to a   considerable increase in the aboveground biomass production and reduced   the infection with arbuscular mycorrhiza of both plant species. We   expected that arbuscular mycorrhiza promotes plant growth by increasing   nutrient availability, but we found the contrary when activated carbon   was added. Chemical analyses of the substrate showed, that adding   activated carbon resulted in a strong increase in plant available   phosphate and in a decrease of the C(organic)/N(total) ration both of   which suggest stimulated microbial activity. Thus, activated carbon not   only reduced potential allelopathic effects, but substantially changed   the chemistry of the substrate. These results show that activated carbon   should be handled with great care in ecological experiments on   allelopathy because of possible confounding effects on the soil   community.

Using phytoplankton ecological   niches to predict their responses to multiple environmental stressors is   a promising new approach. Functional traits of phytoplankton, such as   resource utilization traits and tolerance curves for various   environmental factors like temperature, can be used to define niches   along major axes. Characterization of pairwise and higher dimension   trade-offs among traits should help predict possible niche changes along   multiple dimensions simultaneously. The potential for evolutionary   responses to global change can be assessed using evolution experiments   with individual strains, as well as in communities, because the   responses may depend on the presence of competitors, grazers, and   parasites. The evolutionary pressures induced by multiple stressors may   have interactive effects and, thus, should be investigated   simultaneously.

In North America,   southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) range has expanded northward   as a result of climate change, and northern flying squirrel (G.   sabrinus) range has shifted north, likely in response to competition. We   tracked both species abundances as well as climate, food availability,   and forest structure over 31 yr, and found complete species turnover   from G. sabrinus to G. volans in 18 yr. We tested multiple generalized   least squares models of each species' abundance over time. The top model   for G. sabrinus indicated that abundance was likely shaped by the   arrival of G. volans, a competitor and known vector of a pathological   nematode, food, and modest anthropogenic changes to forest structure;   the top model for G. volans suggested that warm winters coinciding with   high mast years likely facilitated the initial establishment of G.   volans, whereas positive density dependence likely shaped subsequent   population dynamics. The only significant change to local climate was an   increase in minimum summer temperature, which would enhance the survival   of Strongyloides robustus, the nematode carried by G. volans and   detrimental to G. sabrinus.

The goal of this project was to begin to address this knowledge gap in   regards to a GM potato line, cisgenically engineered for resistance to   Phytophthora infestans (responsible organism of the Irish potato famine   causing late blight disease). For this, a 3 year (2013, 2014, 2015)   field experimental study was completed, containing two conventional   genotypes (cvs. Desiree and Sarpo Mira) and a cisgenic genotype (cv.

Results: Nematode structure and diversity were measured through   established indices, accounts and taxonomy with factors recording a   significant effect limited to the climatic conditions across the three   seasons of the study and chemical applications associated with the   selected disease management strategy. Based on the metrics studied, the   cultivation of the cisgenic potato genotype exerted no significant   effect (P > 0.05) on nematode community diversity or structure.

Synthesis and applications.   Schedonorus arundinaceus cultivars vary in their competitive ability and   effects on communities, and this variation may be explained by the   application for which the cultivars were developed, their endophyte   status and genetic differences among cultivars within application   categories. We recommend preferentially selecting cultivars developed   for turf applications and cultivars with low seed endophyte presence to   minimize negative effects of seeding a non-native grass on communities.

The underlying causes of pathogen   dilution are complex, because they involve non-additive (driven by host   interactions and differential habitat use) and additive (controlled by   host species composition) mechanisms. Here, we used measures of   complementarity and selection traditionally employed in the field of   biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) to quantify the net effect of host   diversity on disease dynamics of the amphibian- killing fungus   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Complementarity occurs when average   infection load in diverse host assemblages departs from that of each   component species in uniform populations. Selection measures the   disproportionate impact of a particular species in diverse assemblages   compared with its performance in uniform populations, and therefore has   strong additive and non-additive properties. We experimentally infected   tropical amphibian species of varying life histories, in single-and   multi-host treatments, and measured individual Bd infection loads. Host   diversity reduced Bd infection in amphibians through a mechanism   analogous to complementarity (sensu BEF), potentially by reducing shared   habitat use and transmission among hosts. Additionally, the selection   component indicated that one particular terrestrial species showed   reduced infection loads in diverse assemblages at the expense of   neighbouring aquatic hosts becoming heavily infected. By partitioning   components of diversity, our findings underscore the importance of   additive and non-additive mechanisms underlying the DE.",593,NO,SH,,,

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of   Serratula tinctoria L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological   characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the   standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles:   distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral   and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.   2. Serratula tinctoria is a gynodioecious perennial forb of open or   semi-shaded habitats including grassland, heath, mire, open woodland and   scrub and their ecotones. It is found throughout most of England and   Wales but it is very rare in Scotland and absent from Ireland. Serratula   tinctoria is found in Europe as far north as southern Sweden and Norway.   It is absent from much of the Boreal biogeographical zone, including   most of Fennoscandia and northern Poland, Russia and the Baltic States,   and from the lowland Mediterranean zone.   3. Serratula tinctoria occurs on soils overlying a wide variety of   superficial deposits and sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks,   including ultramafic rocks. The pH range of these soils is wide, ranging   from acidic to moderately alkaline but with nutrient status classed as   oligotrophic, or more rarely mesotrophic. In mire or fen habitats, it   occurs in topogenous or soligenous situations with a similar soil water   pH range. It is able to tolerate a wide spectrum of soil water-table   conditions, ranging from very dry to flooded.   4. Serratula tinctoria is pollinated by various insects of the orders   Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees,   hoverflies and butterflies. It produces phytoecdysteroids, which mimic a   hormone that regulates insect development.   5. The seed has a feathery pappus for wind dispersal and establishment   is primarily from seed. However, it has strong dispersal limitation with   slow migration rates into restored grasslands of 1 m year(-1). The   species has a short-term persistent seed bank. Seedling recruitment is   enhanced by disturbance that creates bare ground, increasing light flux   and lower cover of bryophytes and litter, and reduced by higher nutrient   availability and lack of management.   6. Formerly the source of a yellow dye, S. tinctoria has declined in   Britain since at least the late 19th Century primarily due to a   combination of drainage, ploughing and agricultural improvement and,   conversely, lack of management by cutting and grazing in its grassland,   heath and mire habitats. There is evidence that the decline slowed or   stabilised between the late-1980s and the mid-2000s, in part due to the   positive impact of conservation via statutory protection on designated   sites and wider measures delivered through agri-environment schemes.",594,NO,SH,,,

To add to the growing body of research on the dynamics and   diversity of these cyanophages, we measured cyanophage abundance,   diversity, and community composition monthly for 15 mo at 3 coastal   locations in Southern California, USA. We characterized over 900   individual cyanophages, isolated on Synechococcus sp. WH7803, by   amplifying and sequencing 2 different genes from each isolate: g20 (the   portal protein gene) and psbA (a host-derived gene involved in   photosynthesis). The taxonomic composition and diversity of isolated   cyanophages were highly variable over time, with little variation across   the 3 locations. Particular taxa dominated the community at distinct   times of year, with more rapid turnover of dominant types and higher   overall abundance and diversity during spring and summer. These temporal   patterns as well as taxonomic designations were highly congruent for   both genes, based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined at 99\%   nucleotide similarity, despite a greater level of amino acid   conservation within psbA as compared to g20. Overall, this suggests that   either gene can serve as a useful marker for cyanophage diversity.   However, we detected 1 myovirus taxon (representing about 2.5\% of the   isolates) of uncertain phylogenetic affiliation that was negative for   psbA amplification. Further sampling is necessary to assess whether   these temporal dynamics in cyanophage composition, diversity, and   abundance are seasonally recurring.",595,NO,SH,,,

SCG contains large   amounts of organic compounds (i.e., polyphenols, lignin, cellulose,   hemicellulose, and other polysaccharides) that can be exploited as a   source of value-added products. Effective valorization of SCG depends on   the extraction methods. Therefore, the aim of this study was to   investigate the influence of pretreatments such as microwave and   ultrasonic and modifiers such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide on   subcritical water (SCW) liquefaction of SCG at different temperatures   (180-240 degrees C) and pressures (20-60 bar). The hydrolysate was   studied for their total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids content   (TFC), reducing sugars (RSs), protein content antioxidants, and   antimicrobial activities. The extracts showed that the TPC value ranged   from 33.1 +/- 1.89 to 51.2 +/- 1.87 and the TFC value ranged from 15.13   +/- 1.73 to 25.51 +/- 1.55 mg/g of GA and CE respectively. The RSs and   protein content ranged from 8.88 +/- 1.19 to 37.9 +/- 4.21 g/100 and   20.05 +/- 2.33 to 47.38 +/- 4.41 respectively. DPPH and ABTS radical   scavenging antioxidant activities ranged from 036 +/- 0.03 to 0.51 +/-   0.08 and from 0.39 +/- 0.04 to 0.76 +/- 0.01 mmol TE/g, respectively.   The extracts also showed very good antimicrobial activity against common   foodborne pathogens with Staphylococcus aureus being the most sensitive   bacteria having an MIC value of 5 mg/ml lyophilized extracts. This study   showed that pretreatment and the use of modifiers could increase the   liquefaction of SCG and composition of the extracts by reducing the   severity index. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess   the importance of the different mechanisms governing the success of   Conyza canadensis, a globally successful invader, we simultaneously   tested several recent hypotheses potentially explaining the factors   leading to biological invasion.   Methods   We tested (i) whether plants from the non-native range showed a higher   fitness than plants from the native North American range, (ii) whether   they differed in resistance against an invasive generalist herbivore,   the slug Arion lusitanicus and against a recently established specialist   aphid herbivore, Uroleucon erigeronense and (iii) experimentally   assessed whether C canadensis releases allelopathic chemicals that have   harmful effects on competing species in the non-native range. We   compared populations along a similar latitudinal gradient both in the   native North American and invasive European range and analysed patterns   of adaptive clinal variation in biomass production.   Important Findings   The invasion success of C canadensis in Europe cannot be attributed to a   single trait, but to a combination of factors. Invasive plants benefited   from increased growth and above all, increased reproduction (a key trait   in an annual plant) and were less attacked by a co-migrated specialist   enemy. The observed loss of defence against generalist slugs did not   translate into a decreased fitness as invasive C. canadensis plants   showed a high re-growth potential. In contrast to earlier in vitro   studies, we detected no allelopathic effects on the competing flora in   the non-native range. The latitudinal cline in vegetative biomass   production in the non-native range observed in our common garden study   indicates a high adaptive potential. However, only further genetic   studies will provide conclusive evidence whether the differentiation in   the non-native range is caused by pre-adaptation and sorting-out   processes of Putatively repeatedly introduced populations of this   composite, long-distance disperser with highly volatile seeds or evolved   de novo, as a rapid response to new selection pressures in the   non-native range.",597,NO,SH,,,

Although this practice offers potential for pest and   disease control, very little is known about the influence of introduced   microbes on the indigenous microbial communities and vice versa. This   study examines fungal and bacterial community structures of diverse   horticultural growing media and evaluates their interactions with a   plant Euonymus fortunei and/or the insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium   anisopliae. Complementary physiological (Biolog(TM)) and molecular   (automated ribosomal intergenic space analysis - ARISA) techniques were   applied to analyse community structure and diversity over 1 yr. These   studies clearly showed distinct microbial communities in different plant   growing media. Irrespective of media or any treatment, initial microbial   diversity was very low but increased significantly over 1 yr. A   succession of new fungal and bacterial species was observed, with   species originally present being displaced. This succession led to the   establishment of distinct microbial community structures for each medium   over 6-12 months. ARISA studies showed that bacterial and fungal   community profiles were influenced by the presence of plant and M.   anisopliae, but in complex ways depending on the medium. Certain   microbes were specifically associated or inhibited by the presence of M.   anisopliae and/or E. fortunei. Physiological studies, however, showed   that neither M. anisopliae nor plant had any significant effect on the   communities' ability to decomposition a batch of carbon sources.   Although diverse microbial communities were observed in different media,   none of these communities influenced the efficacy of M. anisopliae.

Soil fungal populations   make an important physical and chemical contribution to soil. For   example, mycorrhizal species are important in plant nutrition but are   often overlooked when considering management practices for efficient   soil function. We undertook DNA metabarcoding (Ion Torrent) using novel   PCR primers and high-throughput sequencing of the D1 region of the large   ribosomal subunit of the rRNA locus, to assess the effect of different   forages and cereal tillage methods on the soil fungal community. The   study comprised five forage treatments, perennial ryegrass (Lolium   perenne) with either low or high N, chicory (Cichorium intybus), red   clover (Trifolium pratense) or white clover (Trifolium repens) grown   over 3 harvest years (2010-2012). Cultivation of chicory, red clover or   white clover led to significantly divergent soil fungal communities,   with a notably lower diversity of fungal populations under clover,   suggesting a link to soil N dynamics. Consistent with this, was a   negative correlation of soil nitrate-N levels with populations of   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and other root-associated fungal   groupings (dark septate endophytes, `CHEG', Sebacinales and   Ceratobasidiaceae). In contrast, abundance of Fungi belonging to the   genera Mortierella and Cryptococcus were positively correlated with soil   nitrate-N, with Mortierella also being negatively correlated with soil   P. Spring wheat was sown on the same plots (April 2013) followed by   winter barley (October 2013). Half of each plot was sown either after   ploughing or by direct drilling. A legacy effect of the preceding forage   crop on the fungal community was detected after both cereal crops, with   plots previously cultivated with ryegrass being most divergent. No   overall effect of establishment method on fungal communities was   detected but AMF and CHEG fungi were more abundant on direct-drilled   plots and pathogenic fungi were more abundant on ploughed plots after   the sowing of winter barley.

In Australia, some ecologists extend this to most or all   ecosystems across the landscape. They regard contemporary human burning   or prescribed burning as an unnatural disturbance that threatens   biodiversity. Their particular concern is the potential extinction of   slow maturing obligate seeders by frequent fire. However, a completely   different picture emerges from study of Australia's ecological history   and prehistory. There is ample evidence that Australian vegetation was   shaped by thousands of years of frequent mild burning by Aborigines.   Infrequent, high intensity lightning fires affected only small areas of   wet forests in refuges that were physically protected from mild fires.   We present a case study of ecosystems on the Sydney sandstones to   demonstrate that a regime of infrequent high intensity wildfires since   European settlement has caused structural changes and reduced spatial   diversity. This has put many fire dependent plants at a competitive   disadvantage and increased their susceptibility to disease. We argue   that biodiversity, ecosystem health, and fire safety are threatened by   lack of frequent mild fire. Ecological theory should build on ecological   history. Australia is fortunate in having comprehensive historical   records of Aboriginal burning against which paleoecological data can be   calibrated.

While natural areas in   urban environments may provide habitat for declining groups of birds,   little is known about effects of urbanization on the reproductive   success of birds, such as grassland birds, that are typically thought to   be associated with more rural landscapes. While typical conservation   efforts have focused on conserving large patches of grassland in   landscapes containing minimal amounts of woody vegetation and   development, the assumption that habitat located in developed landscapes   is of poor quality has not been tested and may wrongly devalue   grasslands located in an urban matrix. To examine the influence of   development on habitat quality for grassland birds, we studied grassland   bird nest predation and brood parasitism in patches of varying size   along an urbanization gradient in northeastern Illinois. Because nest   predation is the primary cause of reproductive failure and a potentially   limiting factor for grassland bird populations, we used miniature video   cameras to identify predators at a subset of nests. From 2012 to 2013,   we monitored 432 nests of 16 grassland bird species. Nest predation   rates decreased with urbanization in the landscape as did probability of   brood parasitism. We filmed 44 nests and documented 19 predation events.   We found that coyotes Canis latrans, white-tailed deer Odocoileus   virginianus and thirteen-lined ground squirrels Ictidomys   tridecemlineatus were important nest predators in our study system.   Contrary to prior assumptions, our results suggest that grasslands   located in urban landscapes may provide habitat of equal or greater   quality than many rural grasslands.",601,NO,SH,,,

This is an   important gap because feedbacks to the atmosphere may change as future   O-3 levels increase or decrease, depending on air quality and climate   policies. Global simulation of O-3 using the Community Earth System   Model (CESM) revealed that in 2000, about 40\% of the Global 200   terrestrial ecoregions (ER) were exposed to O-3 above thresholds for   ecological risks, with highest exposures in North America and Southern   Europe, where there is field evidence of adverse effects of O-3, and in   central Asia. Experimental studies show that O-3 can adversely affect   the growth and flowering of plants and alter species composition and   richness, although some communities can be resilient. Additional effects   include changes in water flux regulation, pollination efficiency, and   plant pathogen development. Recent research is unraveling a range of   effects below-ground, including changes in soil invertebrates, plant   litter quantity and quality, decomposition, and nutrient cycling and   carbon pools. Changes are likely slow and may take decades to become   detectable. CESM simulations for 2050 show that O-3 exposure under   emission scenario RCP8.5 increases in all major biomes and that policies   represented in scenario RCP4.5 do not lead to a general reduction in O-3   risks; rather, 50\% of ERs still show an increase in exposure. Although   a conceptual model is lacking to extrapolate documented effects to ERs   with limited or no local information, and there is uncertainty about   interactions with nitrogen input and climate change, the analysis   suggests that in many ERs, O-3 risks will persist for biodiversity at   different trophic levels, and for a range of ecosystem processes and   feedbacks, which deserves more attention when assessing ecological   implications of future atmospheric pollution and climate change.",602,NO,SH,,,

Family A DNA polymerases, critical to DNA replication and   repair in prokaryotes, are found in many tailed bacteriophages. The   essential role of DNA polymerase in viral replication makes it a useful   target for connecting viral diversity with an important biological   feature of viruses. Capturing the full diversity of this polymorphic   gene by targeted approaches has been difficult; thus, full-length DNA   polymerase genes were assembled out of virioplankton shotgun metagenomic   sequence libraries (viromes). Within the viromes novel DNA polymerases   were common and found in both double-stranded (ds) DNA and   single-stranded (ss) DNA libraries. Finding DNA polymerase genes in   ssDNA viral libraries was unexpected, as no such genes have been   previously reported from ssDNA phage. Surprisingly, the most common   virioplankton DNA polymerases were related to a siphovirus infecting an   alpha-proteobacterial symbiont of a marine sponge and not the podoviral   T7-like polymerases seen in many other studies. Amino acids predictive   of catalytic efficiency and fidelity linked perfectly to the   environmental clades, indicating that most DNA polymerase-carrying   virioplankton utilize a lower efficiency, higher fidelity enzyme.   Comparisons with previously reported, PCR-amplified DNA polymerase   sequences indicated that the most common virioplankton metagenomic DNA   polymerases formed a new group that included siphoviruses.

Primary national data   sources included observed insect- and pathogen-induced mortality, key   critical loads for soil and the atmosphere, long term seasonal   departures in temperature and precipitation, road densities,   uncharacteristic wildfires, historical fire regime departure, wildfire   potential, insect and pathogen risk, and vegetation departure from   natural range of variability.

Results from the analysis showed that about 74   percent of NFS lands had moderate or better overall ecological   integrity.

Gross primary production remained low and similar among   years, while NH4+ uptake length in both 2012 and 2014 was longer than   pre-decline. Nitrogen flux to epilithon increased after the decline and   continued to do so through 2014, but N fluxes to fine particulate   organic matter and SPOM decreased and remained low.

Bomb calorimetry was used to measure   energy (kj . m(-2) . y(-1)) allocated to host growth, reproduction, and   respiration in infected and uninfected isopods and to parasite tissue in   infected isopods. Infected isopod individuals allocated similar to 21\%   of their net production energy to parasite growth, and they were larger   (length), consumed more leaf detritus, and lost significantly more   energy to respiration than uninfected controls (P <= 0.05). They also   allocated proportionally less energy to tissue growth, allocated zero   energy to reproduction, and were less efficient at converting energy   into isopod biomass when compared to uninfected controls (P <= 0.05). In   the field, isopod populations were surveyed monthly for a year. The   parasite had a mean infection prevalence in the stream of 30.19\% +/-   8.31 SE with a mean intensity of 1.12 +/- 0.39 SE parasites/host in the   population, and based on this infection rate, it is estimated that   similar to 6.7\% of total production energy of the isopod population   (infected and uninfected) is diverted towards the parasite.",608,YES,SH,yes,,

Certain root-colonizing bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas also benefit   plants by promoting growth, suppressing pathogens or inducing systemic   resistance (ISR), and some strains also have insecticidal activity.

In this study, we evaluated how colonization by the   growth-promoting and insecticidal bacteria Pseudomonas protegens CHA0   and Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL1391 affects the production of E beta C   upon feeding by larvae of the banded cucumber beetle, Diabrotica   balteata Le Conte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Using chemical analysis   and gene expression measurements, we found that E beta C production and   the expression of the E beta C synthase gene (tps23) were enhanced in   Pseudomonas protegens CHA0-colonized roots after 72 h of D. balteata   feeding. Undamaged roots colonized by Pseudomonas spp. showed no   measurable increase in E beta C production, but a slight increase in   tps23 expression.

Methods   Above and below ground plant biomass of all species was harvested   following 3-4 yr of 1-2 degrees C of experimental warming. Biomass   allocation and arbuscular mycorrhizal infection were also examined in   the two dominant species, Salix rotundifolia and Carex aquatilis.   Results   Above-ground biomass of graminoids increased in response to warming but   there was no difference in total plant biomass or the ratio of   above-ground to below-ground biomass for the community as a whole.

The disease is likely to occur across the range of the devil   within 5 years. This urgent time frame requires management options that   can be implemented immediately: the establishment of insurance   populations, in captivity, wild-living on islands, and aiming for   eradication in areas that can be isolated. The long-term options of the   spontaneous or assisted evolution of resistance or development of a   field-deliverable vaccine are unlikely to be available in time. The   disease's characteristic allograft transmission through intimate contact   simplifies isolation of insurance populations and breaking transmission   in suppression trials. Better knowledge of contact matrices in wild   devils will help focus timing and demographic targets of removals. A   metapopulation approach is needed that integrates captive and   wild-living island and peninsula (disease suppression) populations to   minimize the loss of genetic diversity over 50 years until either   extinction and reintroduction can occur, resistance evolves or a   field-deliverable vaccine is developed. Given the importance of the   insurance populations and the low genetic diversity of devils, a   conservative target for retention of 95\% genetic diversity is   recommended. Encouraging preliminary results of the first   disease-suppression trial on a large peninsula show fewer late stage   tumors and no apparent population decline.

Numerous studies have detected Cryptomycota as   DNA sequences in aquatic, terrestrial, and animal associated habitats,   though no study to date has specifically targeted the group by PCR. In   this study, we developed Cryptomycota-specific and preferential primers   for the 185 rRNA gene in order to facilitate studies on the biodiversity   and ecology of the group. The diversity of sequences and habitat   association of Cryptomycota was surveyed across three environments:   freshwater sediment, marine sediment, and soil. The new primers were   able to recover a large proportion of Cryptomycota sequences: of 56   sequences cloned or directly sequenced, 44 were unique OTUs and (39/44)   88.6 \% were phylogenetically affiliated with Cryptomycota. This study   expands the boundary of current Cryptomycota sequence diversity; unique   Cryptomycota OTUs were spread across six of 12 supported Cryptomycota   sub dades.

We conducted an in-depth review of the   traits of successful invasive forest insects and the ecological   processes involved in insect invasions across the universal invasion   phases (transport and arrival, establishment, spread and impacts). Most   forest insect invasions are accidental consequences of international   trade. The dominant invasion `pathways' are live plant imports, shipment   of solid wood packaging material, ``hitchhiking'' on inanimate   objects, and intentional introductions of biological control agents.   Invading insects exhibit a variety of life histories and include   herbivores, detritivores, predators and parasitoids. Herbivores are   considered the most damaging and include wood-borers, sap-feeders,   foliage-feeders and seed eaters. Most non-native herbivorous forest   insects apparently cause little noticeable damage but some species have   profoundly altered the composition and ecological functioning of   forests. In some cases, non-native herbivorous insects have virtually   eliminated their hosts, resulting in major changes in forest composition   and ecosystem processes. Invasive predators (e.g., wasps and ants) can   have major effects on forest communities. Some parasitoids have caused   the decline of native hosts. Key ecological factors during the   successive invasion phases are illustrated. Escape from natural enemies   explains some of the extreme impacts of forest herbivores but in other   cases, severe impacts result from a lack of host defenses due to a lack   of evolutionary exposure. Many aspects of forest insect invasions remain   poorly understood including indirect impacts via apparent competition   and facilitation of other invaders, which are often cryptic and not well   studied.",615,NO,SH,,,

Seventeen of 21 species assessed from the   families Ericaceae, Fabaceae, Myrtaceae and Proteaceae were   significantly less abundant in non-treated diseased vegetation.

Between 76-275 ITS1 and 51-260 ITS2 fungal OTUs were observed for each   sample, respectively. The core fungal community consisted of wide spread   yeast or yeast-like fungi (e.g. Cryptococcus) and genera containing   species commonly known to be associated with plants (e.g. Alternaria,   Epicoccum) including important pathogens such as Fusarium spp. and   Pleospora spp. Geographic location of the field stations was identified   as the determining factor best explaining the observed differences in   the fungal communities on harvested barley in western Canada.

These studies have   found that increasing enemy diversity can strengthen, weaken, and not   affect prey suppression, demonstrating that multi-enemy effects on prey   are context-dependent. Here we ask how one factor, plant species   identity, influences multi-enemy effects on prey. We focused on two   plant species of agricultural importance, potato (Solanum tuberosum),   and collards (Brassica oleracea L.). These species share a common   herbivorous pest, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), but vary in   structural and chemical traits that affect aphid reproductive rates and   which may also influence inter-enemy interactions. In a large-scale   field experiment, overall prey exploitation varied dramatically among   the plant species, with enemies reducing aphid populations by similar to   94\% on potatoes and similar to 62\% on collards. Increasing enemy   diversity similarly strengthened aphid suppression on both plants,   however, and there was no evidence that plant species identity   significantly altered the relationship between enemy diversity and prey   suppression. Microcosm experiments suggested that, on both collards and   potatoes, intraspecific competition among natural enemies exceeded   interspecific competition. Enemy species showed consistent and   significant differences in where they foraged on the plants, and enemies   in the low-diversity treatment tended to spend less time foraging than   enemies in the high-diversity treatment. These data suggest that   increasing enemy diversity may strengthen aphid suppression because   interspecific differences in where enemies forage on the plant allow for   greater resource partitioning. Further, these functional benefits of   diversity appear to be robust to changes in plant species identity.",622,NO,SH,,,

However, the question of how   local is local is still highly debated in conservation biology because   studies on genetic patterns of variation within and among populations at   the local scale are limited and scattered. In this study, we compare the   level of genetic differentiation among populations of six different   perennial plant species based on their variation in spring flushing. We   assess the level of additive genetic variation present within the local   population. For all six species, we find significant differentiation   among populations from sites with mean annual temperature ranging   between 7.4 degrees C and 8.4 degrees C. The observed variation can only   be partly explained by the climate at the site of origin. Most clear   relationship between early flushing and higher average spring   temperature is observed for the three wind-pollinated species in the   study, while the relations are much less clear for the three   insect-pollinated species. This supports that pollination system can   influence the balance between genetic drift and natural selection and   thereby influence the level of local adaptation in long-lived species.

Due to   reduced inputs of agrochemicals, the success of organic farming is   heavily dependent on the ecosystem services provided by the soil   microbial community, and in particular by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi   (AMF). Numerous studies have already shown that also grapevines (Vitis   vinifera) depend on AMF for normal growth and development. To what   extent organic agriculture benefits the AMF communities on vines.at   regional scales, however, is still poorly understood. Here, we first   quantified the relative importance of organic management, soil chemical   characteristics, and geography on vineyard AMF diversity and community   composition. Second, we tested whether soil nutrients fundamentally   change the host-AMF community dynamics through changing universality of   dissimilarity overlap curves. To identify AMF communities, we used high   throughput pyrosequencing on 170 root samples from grapevines   originating from 18 conventionally and 16 organically managed Belgian   and Dutch vineyards. We found no differences in AMF diversity between   conventionally and organically managed vineyards. Soil phosphorus   content and soil acidity, however, was strongly negatively associated   with AMF diversity. Together with management type (organic vs.   conventional), these two soil variables did also explain most of the   variation in AMF community composition. The observed accumulation of   soil copper, used to control fungal diseases, especially in   organieallymanaged vineyards, did not affect AMF communities. We   observed, however, that copper concentration in the soil increased with   vineyard age, indicating copper accumulation in the soil over time. AMF   communities showed a regularity in interactions among taxa and their   host. Under high soil P availability, however, interactions became more   irregular. The potential benefits of organic vineyard management in   terms of a high diversity of AMF are highly compromised by elevated soil   phosphorus levels which may jeopardize the role of these symbionts in   improving plant health and soil fertility. Decreasing nutrient inputs,   even organic, is a key step in developing diverse AMF communities in   vineyards.",625,NO,SH,,,

Phytophthora ramorum, the causal agent of the emergent forest disease   sudden oak death (SOD), has a wide host range, but mortality is   concentrated in a few dominant tree species of coastal forests in   California and Oregon. We examined interactions between P. ramorum and   its hosts in redwood and mixed evergreen forest types over an 80,000 ha   area in the Big Sur ecoregion of central California, an area that   constitutes the southernmost range of the pathogen and includes forest   stands on the advancing front of pathogen invasion. We established a   network of 280 long-term forest monitoring plots to understand how host   composition and forest structure facilitated pathogen invasion, and   whether selective mortality from SOD has led to shifts in community   composition. Infested and uninfested sites differed significantly in   host composition due to both historical trends and disease impacts. A   reconstruction of pre-disease forest composition showed that stands that   eventually became infested with the pathogen tended to be more mature   with larger stems than stands that remained pathogen-free, supporting   the hypothesis of aerial dispersal by the pathogen across the landscape   followed by local understory spread. The change in species composition   in uninfested areas was minimal over the study period, while infested   stands had large changes in composition, correlated with the loss of   tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus), signaling the potential for SOD   to dramatically change coastal forests through selective removal of a   dominant host. Forest diversity plays an important role in pathogen   establishment and spread, and is in turn changed by pathogen impacts.   Asymmetric competency among host species means that impacts of P.   ramorum on forest diversity are shaped by the combination and dominance   of hosts present in a stand.",627,YES,SH,yes,,

The growth index of the trees is closely related to the   dryness index in June (r (2) = 0.55). Along with water stress, declining   trees were also exposed to stem pests and plant pathogens. The primary   cause of Siberian pine decline is water stress due to the increasing   climate aridity. The weakened waterstressed trees were sensitized to   pathogens. The synergism of climatic and biotic effects led to the   decline of Siberian pine stands.

This may be due to the short-term   nature of previous field experiments, differences in soil properties   between studies, or plant-soil feedbacks that influence AMF communities   in roots and soil over time. In this field experiment, we used split   plots to evaluate the effect of Bt or non-Bt maize cultivation history   on AMF spore abundance, diversity, root colonization, and growth of   seven different genotypes of Bt maize and five corresponding non-Bt   parental (P) isolines. We found that Bt plants had higher leaf   chlorophyll content when they were grown in plots that had been   cultivated with Bt maize the previous year, and similarly, non-Bt plants   had higher chlorophyll content when they were grown in plots with a   non-Bt cultivation history, indicative of a positive feedback effect.   There was a lower density of AMF spores in plots with a Bt maize   cultivation history than in plots where P maize had been grown in the   previous year, but no difference in spore diversity. Despite the   differences in spore density, we found no significant differences in AMF   colonization or root or shoot biomass between plots with a cultivation   history of Bt and P maize. This study presents the first evidence of an   effect of Bt maize cultivation on the soil ecosystem, but also provides   further evidence that this effect is not necessarily large or easily   detectable within the range of normal environmental variation.

Functional landscape   connectivity for such species influences the spatial distribution of   associated ecological services and disservices.   We studied how spatio-temporal variation in the risk-resource trade-off,   generated by fluctuations in human activities and environmental   conditions, influences the routine movements of roe deer across a   heterogeneous landscape, generating shifts in functional connectivity at   daily and seasonal time scales.   We used GPS locations of 172 adult roe deer and step selection functions   to infer landscape connectivity. In particular, we assessed the   influence of six habitat features on fine scale movements across four   biological seasons and three daily periods, based on variations in the   risk-resource trade-off.   The influence of habitat features on roe deer movements was strongly   dependent on proximity to refuge habitat, i.e. woodlands. Roe deer   confined their movements to safe habitats during daytime and during the   hunting season, when human activity is high. However, they exploited   exposed open habitats more freely during night-time. Consequently, we   observed marked temporal shifts in landscape connectivity, which was   highest at night in summer and lowest during daytime in autumn. In   particular, the onset of the autumn hunting season induced an abrupt   decrease in landscape connectivity.   Human disturbance had a strong impact on roe deer movements, generating   pronounced spatio-temporal variation in landscape connectivity. However,   high connectivity at night across all seasons implies that Europe's most   abundant and widespread large herbivore potentially plays a key role in   transporting ticks, seeds and nutrients among habitats.",630,NO,SH,,,

In the investigated lakes, the mechanism for   regulating prokaryotic production varied with sampled depth from grazing   control in the euphotic to control due to viral lysis in the aphotic.

However, inconsistent performance in disease   abatement, after their employment, has been a problem. This has been   attributed, in part, to the inability of the biocontrol bacterium to   maintain a critical threshold population necessary for sustained   biocontrol activity. Our results indicate that a nitrogen stabilizer   (N-Serve(R), Dow Agrosciences) selectively and significantly enhanced,   by two to three orders of magnitude, the resident population of   fluorescent pseudomonads in the amended (i.e., 25 mu g ml(-1)   nitrapyrin, the active ingredient) and recycled nutrient solution used   in the cultivation of hydroponically grown gerbera and pepper plants.   Pseudomonas putida was confirmed as the predominant bacterium   selectively enhanced. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism   (T-RFLP) analysis of 16S rDNA suggested that N-Serve(R) selectively   increased P. putida and reduced bacterial diversity 72 h after   application. In vitro tests revealed that the observed population   increases of fluorescent pseudomonads were preceded by an early growth   suppression of indigenous aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (AHB)   population. Interestingly, the fluorescent pseudomonad population did   not undergo this decrease, as shown in competition assays. Xylene and   1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (i.e., the inert ingredients in N-Serve(R)) were   responsible for a significant percentage of the fluorescent pseudomonad   population increase. Furthermore, those increases were significantly   higher when the active ingredient (i.e., nitrapyrin) and the inert   ingredients were combined, which suggests a synergistic response. P.   putida strains were screened for the ability to produce antifungal   compounds and for the antifungal activity against Pythium aphanidermatum   and Phytophthora capsici. The results of this study suggest the presence   of diverse mechanisms with disease-suppressing potential. This study   demonstrates the possibility of using a specific substrate to   selectively enhance and maintain desired populations of a   natural-occurring bacterium such as P. putida, a trait considered to   have great potential in biocontrol applications for plant protection.",633,NO,SH,,,

If the process of habitat filtering plays a role in   generating the LES, the LES could weaken in communities that have yet to   be filtered by the current environment, for example after abiotic   environmental change. LES traits are commonly used to predict community   and ecosystem processes, and if the LES weakens in unfiltered   communities, LES-based models may no longer apply.

In the model host-parasitoid system Drosophila   melanogaster-Asobara tabida, toxic filamentous fungi have been shown to   be serious competitors that critically affect the density-dependent   survival of host Drosophila larvae. This study investigates the extent   to which the competing mould Aspergillus niger affects key properties of   the well-studied Drosophila-parasitoid system and how the   host-parasitoid interaction influences the microbial competitor. In   contrast to slightly positive density-dependent host mortality under   mould-free conditions, competing A. niger mediated a strong Allee effect   for parasitised larvae, i.e. mortality decreased with increasing larval   density. It was found that the common toxic fungal metabolite kojic acid   is not responsible for higher death rates in parasitised larvae. Single   parasitised Drosophila larvae were less harmful to fungal reproduction   than unparasitised larvae, but this effect vanished with an increase in   larval density. As predicted from the negative effect of fungi on host   survival and thus on parasitoid fitness at low larval densities, A.   tabida females spent less time foraging in fungus-infested patches.   Interestingly, even though high host larval densities increased host   survival, parasitoids still reduced their search efforts in   fungus-infested patches, indicating a benefit for host larvae from   feeding in the presence of noxious mould.

In the Caribbean, low rates of coral recruitment contribute   to the slow or undetectable rates of recovery in reef ecosystems.   Although algae have long been suspected to interfere with coral   recruitment, the mechanisms of that interaction remain unclear. We   experimentally tested the effects of turf algal abundance on 3   sequential factors important to recruitment of corals: the biophysical   delivery of planktonic coral larvae, their propensity to settle, and the   availability of microhabitats where they survive. We deployed coral   settlement plates inside and outside damselfish Stegastes spp. gardens   and cages. Damselfish aggression reduced herbivory from fishes, and   cages became fouled with turf algae, both locally increasing algal   biomass surrounding the plates. This reduced flushing rates in nursery   microhabitats on the plate underside, limiting larvae available for   settlement. Coral spat settled preferentially on an early successional   crustose coralline alga Titanoderma prototypum but also on or near other   coralline algae, biofilms, and calcareous polychaete worm tubes.

We found no statistically significant differences in   introduced or native species cover between treated and control stands.   Healthy TOH stands often harbor substantial populations of native and   introduced invasive species, and on average, successful control of   overstory TOH by V. albo-atrum did not alter vegetation cover in these   communities.

In this study, we introduce metaproperty analysis of terrestrial   laser scanner (TLS) data, and demonstrate its application through   several ecological classification problems. Metaproperty analysis   considers pulse level and spatial metrics derived from the hundreds of   thousands to millions of lidar pulses present in a single scan from a   typical contemporary instrument. In such large aggregations, properties   of the populations of lidar data reflect attributes of the underlying   ecological conditions of the ecosystems.   2. In this study, we provide the Metaproperty Classification Model to   employ TLS metaproperty analysis for classification problems in ecology.   We applied this to a proof-of-concept study, which classified 88 scans   from rooms and forests with 100\% accuracy, to serve as a template.   3. We then applied the Metaproperty Classification Model in earnest, to   separate scans from temperate and tropical forests with 97.09\% accuracy   (N=224), and to classify scans from inland and coastal tropical   rainforests with 84.07\% accuracy (N=270).   4. The results demonstrate the potential for metaproperty analysis to   identify subtle and important ecosystem conditions, including diseases   and anthropogenic disturbances. Metaproperty analysis serves as an   augmentation to contemporary object reconstruction applications of TLS   in ecology, and can characterize regional heterogeneity.",642,NO,SH,,,

Although plant stoichiometry can influence ecosystem-level processes,   very few studies have addressed whether and how plant C:N stoichiometry   changes with plant diversity and composition. Here, using two long-term   experimental manipulations of plant diversity (Jena and Cedar Creek), we   test whether plant richness (species and functional groups) or   composition (functional group proportions) affects temporal trends and   variability of community-wide C:N stoichiometry. Site fertility   determined the initial community-scale C:N ratio. Communities growing on   N-poor soil (Cedar Creek) began with higher C:N ratios than communities   growing on N-rich soil (Jena). However, site-level plant C:N ratios   converged through time, most rapidly in high diversity plots. In Jena,   plant community C:N ratios increased. This temporal trend was stronger   with increasing richness. However, temporal variability of C:N decreased   as plant richness increased. In contrast, C:N decreased over time at   Cedar Creek, most strongly at high species and functional richness,   whereas the temporal variability of C:N increased with both measures of   diversity at this site. Thus, temporal trends in the mean and   variability of C:N were underlain by concordant changes among sites in   functional group proportions. In particular, the convergence of   community-scale C:N over time at these very different sites was mainly   due to increasing proportions of forbs at both sites, replacing high   mean C:N (C4 grasses, Cedar Creek) or low C:N (legumes, Jena) species.   Diversity amplified this convergence; although temporal trends differed   in sign between the sites, these trends increased in magnitude with   increasing species richness. Our results suggest a predictive   mechanistic link between trends in plant diversity and functional group   composition and trends in the many ecosystem rates that depend on   aboveground community C:N.   Synthesis We compared the effect of plant diversity on the temporal   dynamics of community stoichiometry in two long-term grassland diversity   experiments: the Cedar Creek and Jena Experiments. Changes in community   C:N ratios were accelerated by increasing diversity at both sites, but   in opposite directions depending on soil fertility. Stoichiometry   changes were driven by shifts of functional group composition differing   in their elemental compositions, the identity of the functional groups   depending on the site. Thus, we highlighted that community turnover   constrained the effect of diversity on plant stoichiometry at both sites",643,NO,SH,,,

The results showed that the inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal   fungi communities increased the mycorrhizal infection rate of the plants   and promoted the growth of plants. The Mnp treatment was most effective.   The shoot biomass, root biomass, potassium and nitrogen uptake of the   white clover in Mnp treatment group were increased by 61.54\%, 84.00\%,   62.50\% and 46.71\% respectively, compared with those in non-inoculation   treatment. The inoculation of AMF communities had little effect on the   number of bacteria in the soil, but significantly increased the number   of soil fungi. Mnk treatment group had the highest number of fungi in   the soil, which was 9.91 times that of the non-inoculation treatment   group. The catalase and dehydrogenase activities were both significantly   improved in Mnp treatment by 28.12\% and 205.38\% respectively, compared   with those of the control treatment (-M). The urease, invertase and   cellulase activities reached the highest levels in the Mck treatment;   they were increased by 142.79\%, 41.17\% and 77.62\% respectively,   compared with those of the control treatment. Pearson correlation   analysis showed that the soil enzyme activity was not correlated with   the mycorrhizal infection rate, but correlated with the spore number of   the AMF community.

Mass mortalities provide insight that manipulative   experiments cannot because they alter ecosystems on a larger scale, for   longer time periods, and remove both organisms and their cues from the   environment. We examined shifts in population size structure, vertical   zonation, and use of emersed refuge habitats outside tidepools by the   abundant herbivorous black turban snail Tegula fune-bralis, both before   and after the successive mortalities of two predatory sea stars. The   small cryptic predator Leptasterias spp. suffered a localized but   extreme mortality event in November 2010, followed by two mass   mortalities of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus in August 2011   and autumn 2013. After the local extinction of Leptasterias, the   population size of Tegula more than doubled. Also, since Leptasterias   primarily inhabited only mid to low intertidal tidepools at this site,   small and medium sized snails (which are preferred by Leptasterias)   shifted lower in the intertidal and into tidepools after the mortality   of Leptasterias. After the mortality of Pisaster in August 2011, large   snails did not shift lower in the intertidal zone despite being   preferred by Pisaster. Small and medium sized snails became denser in   the higher zone and outside tidepools, which was not likely due to   Pisaster mortality. Previous studies concluded that Pisaster maintained   vertical size gradients of snails, but our data implicate the overlooked   predator Leptasterias as the primary cause. This natural experiment   indicated that (1) predators exert top-down control over prey population   sizes and lower limits, (2) vertical zonation of prey are dynamic and   controlled in part by prey behavior, and (3) predators exert the   strongest effects on more vulnerable individuals, which typically   inhabit stressful habitats higher on the shore or outside tidepools to   avoid predation. Because the mass mortalities of two predators   drastically reduced both the predation pressure and the chemical cues of   predators in the environment, we were able to investigate both the   effects of predators on prey-populations and the effects on mobile prey   behavior.",645,YES,SH,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

While it is being widely accepted that   complete cessation of gene-flow between populations owing to   long-lasting geographical barriers results in a steady, irreversible   increase of divergence and eventually speciation, the extent to which   various degrees of habitat heterogeneity influences speciation rates is   less well understood. Here, we investigate how small, randomly   distributed physical obstacles influence the distribution of populations   and species, the level of population connectivity (e.g. gene flow), as   well as the mode and tempo of speciation in a virtual ecosystem composed   of prey and predator species. We adapted an existing individual-based   platform, EcoSim, to allow fine tuning of the gene flow's level between   populations by adding various numbers of obstacles in the world. The   platform implements a simple food chain consisting of primary producers,   herbivores (prey) and predators. It allows complex intra-and   inter-specific interactions, based on individual evolving behavioural   models, as well as complex predator-prey dynamics and coevolution in   spatially homogenous and heterogeneous worlds. We observed a direct and   continuous increase in the speed of evolution (e.g. the rate of   speciation) with the increasing number of obstacles in the world. The   spatial distribution of species was also more compact in the world with   obstacles than in the world without obstacles. Our results suggest that   environmental heterogeneity and other factors affecting demographic   stochasticity can directly influence speciation and extinction rates.",646,NO,SH,,,

Moss pillars   have distinct redox-affected sections: oxidative exteriors and reductive   interiors. We have proposed that a ``pillar'' is a community and   habitat of functionally interdependent organisms and may represent a   mini-biosphere. Batteries of 16S rRNA genotypes, or phylotypes, of   eubacteria and cyanobacteria, but no archaea, have been identified in   moss pillars. However, detailed identification or phylogenetic analyses   of the moss and their associated eukaryotic microbiota have not been   performed. This study analyzed near-full-length 18S rRNA gene sequences   obtained from two whole moss pillars. In total, 28 PCR clone libraries   from two whole moss pillars were constructed, and 96 clones from each   library (total 2,688 clones) were randomly selected and sequenced.   Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the phylotype belonging to   Bryophyta, considered to be derived from moss, was closely related (99.9   \%) to the 18S rRNA gene sequence from Leptobryum pyriforme.   Unexpectedly, phylotypes belonging to a novel clade of fungi dominated   (approximately 27-75 \%) the moss pillar libraries. This suggests that   fungi may contribute to carbon cycling in the moss pillar as parasites   or decomposers. In addition, phylotypes related to ciliates and   tardigrades were subdominant in the exterior, while the phylotype of the   ameba-like, single-celled eukaryote, Cercomonas (Cercozoa), was detected   only in the interior. These features were shared by both moss pillars.   The 18S rRNA gene-based profiles demonstrated that redox-related factors   may control distribution of some eukaryotic microbes in a whole moss   pillar.",647,NO,SH,,,

Furthermore,   biologists increasingly appreciate that evolutionary change in a single   species can substantively affect broader ecological processes, such as   community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Models integrating   insights from classical population and quantitative genetics, on the one   hand, and community ecology theory, on the other, are therefore critical   to elucidating the interplay between ecological and evolutionary   processes. However, few modelling approaches integrate ecological and   genetic details into a comprehensive framework. Such models are needed   to account for the reciprocal feedback between evolutionary change and   ecological dynamics, and develop effective responses to anthropogenic   disturbances on natural communities, improve agricultural practices and   manage global health risks such as emerging pathogens. Here we introduce   an open-source, multi-species forward-time population genetics simulator   and framework for rapidly simulating eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our   approach permits building models that can account for alternative   genetic architectures, non-standard population dynamics and demographic   structures, including those driven by interspecific interactions with   other evolving species and the spatial dynamics of metacommunities. By   integrating these processes into a common framework, we aim to   facilitate the development of models that can further elucidate   eco-evolutionary dynamics. While multi-species, forward-time population   genetic models can be computationally expensive, we show how our   framework leverages relatively economical graphics cards installed in   modern desktops. We illustrate the versatility and general applicability   of our approach for two very different case studies: antagonistic   coevolution in space, and the evolution of life-history traits in   response to resource dynamics in physiologically structured populations.   We find that our analyses can run up to c. 200 times faster on a single   commodity graphics card than on a single CPU core, comparable to the   performance gains on small-to-medium sized computer clusters. Our   approach therefore substantively reduces implementation difficulties to   integrating ecological and evolutionary theory.",648,NO,SH,,,

Unfortunately, many urban areas cannot effectively manage their   waste, which causes creation of illegal waste sites. We investigated   communities of small mammals from 14 illegal waste sites in   Mediterranean Slovenia and Croatia. Five species of the family Muridae   were recorded: black rat (Rattus rattus), domestic mouse (Mus musculus),   wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), striped field mouse (Apodemus   agrarius), and yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis). Black rats   and house mice, the two commensal species, were exclusively found or   prevalent in larger waste sites, while the other three Apodemus species   were most frequent in natural or seminatural habitats (> 90\%   specimens). At large waste sites and in the human settlements, commensal   species evidently outnumber the three native Apodemus species (< 25\% of   specimens). Our results show that improper waste management drives the   native rodents to local extinction and replacing them with invasive   commensal species, thereby reducing biodiversity and ecosystem health.

Here we show that different Sinorhizobium strains can form   either nitrogen-fixing nodules or uninfected pseudonodules on certain   cultivated soybeans, while being all effective microsymbionts of some   wild soybeans. However, a few well-infected nodules can be found on a   commercial soybean using inocula containing a mixed pool of Tn5   insertion mutants derived from an incompatible strain. Reverse genetics   and genome sequencing of compatible mutants demonstrated that   inactivation of T3SS (type three secretion system) accounted for this   phenotypic change. These mutations in the T3SS gene cluster were   dominated by parallel transpositions of insertion sequences (ISs) other   than the introduced Tn5. This genetic and phenotypic change can also be   achieved in an experimental evolution scenario on a laboratory time   scale using incompatible wild-type strains as inocula. The ISs acting in   the adaptive evolution of Sinorhizobium strains exhibit broader phyletic   and replicon distributions than other ISs, and prefer target sequences   of low GC\% content, a characteristic feature of symbiosis plasmid where   T3SS genes are located.

Here, we track tap   water microbiome assembly in situ, showing that bacterial community   composition changes rapidly from the city supply following similar to   6-day stagnation, along with an increase in cell count from 10(3)   cells/mL to upwards of 7.8 x 10(5) cells/mL. Remarkably, bacterial   community assembly was highly reproducible in this built environment   system (median Spearman correlation between temporal replicates = 0.78).   Using an island biogeography model, we show that neutral processes   arising from the microbial communities in the city water supply (i.e.,   migration and demographic stochasticity) explained the island community   composition in proximal pipes (Goodness-of-fit = 0.48), yet declined as   water approached the faucet (Goodness-of-fit = 0.21). We developed a   size-effect model to simulate this process, which indicated that pipe   diameter drove these changes by mediating the kinetics of hypochlorite   decay and cell detachment, affecting selection, migration, and   demographic stochasticity.

The focal community module comprises a parasitic   butterfly of conservation concern and its two obligatory host species, a   plant and an ant. We show that both historical dispersal and ongoing   habitat fragmentation shape population genetic diversity of the   butterfly Phengaris alcon and its most limited host species (the plant   Gentiana pneumonanthe). Genetic structure of each species was strongly   driven by geographical structure, altitude and landscape connectivity.   Strikingly, however, was the strong degree of genetic costructure among   the three species that could not be explained by the spatial variables   under study. This finding suggests that factors other than spatial   configuration, including co-evolutionary dynamics and shared dispersal   pathways, cause parallel genetic structure among interacting species.   While the exact contribution of co-evolution and shared dispersal routes   on the genetic variation within and among communities deserves further   attention, our findings demonstrate a considerable degree of genetic   parallelism in natural meta-communities.

From agricultural systems we know that   land-use intensification can negatively impact biological control as an   important ecosystem service. The aim of our study was to investigate the   importance of management regime for natural enemy pressure and   biological control possibilities in forests dominated by European beech.   We hypothesize that the volatile blend released from herbivore-infested   beech trees functions as a signal, attracting parasitoids and herbivore   enemies. Furthermore, we hypothesize that forest management regime   influences the composition of species attracted by these   herbivore-induced beech volatiles. We installed flight-interception   traps next to Lymantria dispar caterpillar-infested young beech trees   releasing herbivore-induced volatiles and next to non-infested control   trees. Significantly more parasitoids were captured next to   caterpillar-infested trees compared to non-infested controls,   irrespective of forest type. However, the composition of the trophic   guilds in the traps did vary in response to forest management regime.   While the proportion of chewing insects was highest in non-managed   forests, the proportion of sucking insects peaked in forests with low   management and of parasitoids in young, highly managed, forest stands.   Neither the number of naturally occurring beech saplings nor herbivory   levels in the proximity of our experiment affected the abundance and   diversity of parasitoids caught. Our data show that herbivore-induced   beech volatiles attract herbivore enemies under field conditions.

Until now, relatively few studies have   investigated which factors may control the abundance of belowground   herbivores. In Dutch coastal foredunes, the root-feeding nematode   Tylenchorhynchus ventralis is capable of reducing the performance of the   dominant grass Ammophila arenaria (Marram grass). However, field surveys   show that populations of this nematode usually are controlled to   nondamaging densities, but the control mechanism is unknown. In the   present study, we first established that T. ventralis populations are   top-down controlled by soil biota. Then, selective removal of soil fauna   suggested that soil microorganisms play an important role in controlling   T. ventralis. This result was confirmed by an experiment where selective   inoculation of microarthropods, nematodes and microbes together with T.   ventralis into sterilized dune soil resulted in nematode control when   microbes were present. Adding nematodes had some effect, whereas   microarthropods did not have a significant effect on T. ventralis. Our   results have important implications for the appreciation of herbivore   controls in natural soils. Soil food web models assume that herbivorous   nematodes are controlled by predaceous invertebrates, whereas many   biological control studies focus on managing nematode abundance by soil   microorganisms. We propose that soil microorganisms play a more   important role than do carnivorous soil invertebrates in the top-down   control of herbivorous ectoparasitic nematodes in natural ecosystems.   This is opposite to many studies on factors controlling root-feeding   insects, which are supposed to be controlled by carnivorous   invertebrates, parasitoids, or entomopathogenic nematodes. Our   conclusion is that the ectoparasitic nematode T. ventralis is   potentially able to limit productivity of the dune grass A. arenaria but   that soil organisms, mostly microorganisms, usually prevent the   development of growth-reducing population densities.",657,MAYBE,SH,yes,,

There is the need for continuous research on forest ecosystems to bridge   knowledge gaps in our understanding of SOM transformations and microbial   processes in a repeatedly burned forest ecosystems. The objectives of   this study were to assess and document the impact of prescribed burning   and thinning on soil labile organic matter fractions, microbial biomass   carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), potential carbon   mineralized (PCM), enzymatic activity, and energy (ATP) potentials.   Labile organic carbon was isolated using the density method, whereas   enzyme activities were determined as described in Bottomley et al.   (Methods of soil analysis: part 2-Microbiological and biochemical   properties, Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Soil Science Society of America,   1994). Microbial biomass C and N (MBC and MBN) were determined using the   fumigation-incubation method. Treatment applications had some effects on   MBC and MBN although these effects were not statistically significant (P   <= 0.05). Light fraction carbon (LFC) and light fraction nitrogen (LFN)   were significantly (P <= 0.05) affected by treatments. Irrespective of   treatment, xylanase activity was the highest (3244 +/- 327-5223 +/- 567   mu mol/g 24 h(-1)), whereas amylase activity was the lowest (12.57 +/-   8.9-116 +/- 42.8 mu mol/g 24 h(-1)). Correlation analysis revealed that   amylase, beta-glucosidase, and NAGase correlated with particulate   organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and LFC,   whereas cellulase, xylanase, and invertase had no correlation with the   labile organic matter fractions. Compared to the referenced treatment   plot, burned and thinned plots had reduced MBC, MBN, and increased PCM   although this was not statistically significant. Although enzyme   activities within plots were significant, no significant enzyme   activities between plots were observed except with amylase. The lack of   statistical significance on microbial activities, MBC, and MBN support   our hypothesis that prescribed burning and thinning temporarily affected   microbial indices, and these parameters are expected to return to   pretreatment levels after a period of time.",658,NO,SH,,,

We measured gas exchange   parameters and foliar carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) of different   infection phases of Masson pine in order to investigate the effect of   Bursaphelenchus xylophilus infection on photosynthetic responses and   resource-use efficiency. The results showed that net photosynthetic rate   (P-n), transpiration rate (T), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and internal   CO2 concentrations (C-i) decreased in the infested trees at   photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) levels from 0 to 2,000 mu mol   m(-2) s(-1) compared with controls. The maximum net photosynthetic rate   (P-max) was significantly declined in the infected trees than in   controls (p <.05). There also exist significant differences in dark   respiration rate (R-d) among different infection phases (p <.05), but   the value is highest in the middle infection phase, followed by the   control and then the terminal infection phase. This indicates that Pinus   massoniana plants need to consume more photosynthetic products during   the middle infection phase in order to defend against pine sawyer beetle   feeding and PWD infection. Isotopic analysis revealed a significant   decrease of the foliar delta C-13 (p <.05), as much as 2.5\% lower in   the infected trees. The mean leaf N content was about 12.94\% less in   the middle infection phase and 27.06\% less in the terminal infection   phase, causing a significant increase of the foliar C:N ratio in   infested trees. Both of the net photosynthetic rates and foliar delta   C-13 were linearly correlated with the foliar N content. We also found a   significant decrease (p <.05) of resource-use efficiency in PWD-induced   P. massoniana plants, which can be attributed to the closure of stomatal   pores and the inactivation or loss of both Rubisco and other key Calvin   cycle enzymes.

Thus according to the MRH, the existence of   larger predators may provide prey with refuge from predation.

However, our   understanding of the factors mediating volatile organic compound (VOC)   signal interpretation by receiver plants and the degree to which   multiple herbivores affect VOC signals is still limited. Here we   investigated whether plant responses to damage-induced VOC signals were   population specific. As a secondary goal, we tested for interference in   signal production or reception when plants were subjected to multiple   types of herbivore damage. We factorially crossed the population sources   of paired Phaseolus lunatus plants (same versus different population   sources) with a mechanical damage treatment to one member of the pair   (i.e. the VOC emitter, damaged versus control), and we measured   herbivore damage to the other plant (the VOC receiver) in the field.   Prior to the experiment, both emitter and receiver plants were naturally   colonized by aphids, enabling us to test the hypothesis that damage from   sap-feeding herbivores interferes with VOC communication by including   emitter and receiver aphid abundances as covariates in our analyses. One   week after mechanical leaf damage, we removed all the emitter plants   from the field and conducted fortnightly surveys of leaf herbivory. We   found evidence that receiver plants responded using population-specific   `dialects' where only receivers from the same source population as the   damaged emitters suffered less leaf damage upon exposure to the volatile   signals. We also found that the abundance of aphids on both emitter and   receiver plants did not alter this volatile signalling during both   production and reception despite well-documented defence crosstalk   within individual plants that are simultaneously attacked by multiple   herbivores. Overall, these results show that plant communication is   highly sensitive to genetic relatedness between emitter and receiver   plants and that communication is resilient to herbivore co-infestation.",665,NO,SH,,,

Due to the ongoing climate changes and reappearance   of some zoonoses that were considered eradicated, there is a growing   concern about potential disease outbreaks. Therefore, the prediction of   increased adult population abundances becomes an essential tool for the   appropriate implementation of mosquito control strategies. In order to   describe the population dynamics of A. vexans and C pipiens mosquitoes   in temperate climate regions, a 3-year period (2008-2010)   climate-dependent model was constructed. The models represent a   combination of mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and   include temperature, rainfall, photoperiods, and the flooding dynamics   of A. vexans breeding sites. Both models are structured according to the   developmental stages, and by individuals' ``age'' (i.e., time spent in   each developmental stage), as we wanted to enable a time delay between   the appearances of different developmental stages of mosquitoes. The   time delay length is temperature dependent, with temperature being the   most important factor influencing morphogenesis rates in immatures and   gonotrophic cycle durations in adult mosquitoes. To determine which   developmental stages are the most sensitive and are those at which   control measures should be aimed, transient elasticities were   calculated. The analysis showed that both mosquito species reacted to   perturbation of the same matrix elements; however, in the C pipiens   model, the stage with greatest proportional sensitivity (i.e.,   elasticity) during most of the three-year reproduction season contained   adults, while in the A. vexans model it contained larvae. The models   were validated by comparing 7-day model outputs with data on human bait   collection (HBC) obtained from the Public Health Institute of   Osijek-Baranja, with both model outputs showing valid compatibility with   field data over the three-year period.

Most of the D. villosus populations from the   invaded range have been found infected with the co-introduced   microsporidian parasite Cucumispora dikerogammari, known to decrease the   predation rate of its host. Infection might thus mitigate the ecological   impact of D. villosus and we wanted to test this assumption using the   comparative functional response approach. We compared the relationship   between resource use and resource availability (i.e. the functional   response, FR) of D. villosus, either with infected individuals or not,   to that of two non-invasive gammarids: Gammarus pulex and Echinogammarus   berilloni. With infected individuals included, D. villosus displayed a   higher FR than the two non-invasive gammarids. Although this effect was   not significant, C. dikerogammari infection tended to alter the FR of D.   villosus with a slight decrease in attack rate and handling time,   resulting in a less steep initial slope and a higher asymptote,   respectively. Removing infected D. villosus from the dataset did not   affect the FR comparison with G. pulex but suppressed the difference in   FR with E. berilloni. Although we cannot exclude the role of sample size   reduction in this effect, this suggests that C. dikerogammari infection   might increase the predation pressure on local prey populations in case   of species replacement between D. villosus and E. berilloni.

Benthic   marine community, marine fish, and land-based surface and groundwater   quality monitoring protocols used a split-panel sampling design to   collect data on ecosystem ``vital signs'' and processes. Vital signs   included coral species richness, percent coverage of benthic community   types, fish abundance and biomass, rugosity, and a suite of surface and   groundwater quality parameters. Data on key processes included top-down   (e.g., fish trophic structure, bleaching, and disease) and bottom-up   (e.g., coral larval settlement, turbidity, pH, temperature, nitrogen,   phosphorus, salinity, groundwater levels) controls. The importance of   these monitoring data is highlighted in four case studies that described   how the information was used to manage a diverse array of issues at the   parks. First, coral reef areas vulnerable to Acanthaster planci   (crown-of-thorns sea star) outbreaks at NPSA and WAPA were identified to   determine whether, and where, to focus culling efforts. Second, data   were used at KALA to delineate zones with high fish biomass that were   sensitive to fishing activities and warranted increased management.   Third, coral settlement data at KALA identified sensitive regions within   the park. Fourth, land-based surface water quality and groundwater   dynamics monitoring data at KAHO were used to support management actions   that mitigate land-based threats to park coral reefs. Advantages of the   monitoring program included the split-panel sampling design, which   provided a more complete picture of the resources with statistically   robust data, and the efficacy of colocating and co-visiting sites for   multiple protocols. The case studies demonstrated the usefulness of   these data in the short term.

We hypothesized that   seedlings close to adults might profit, rather than suffer, from   below-ground fungi, notably from mycorrhiza or decomposers, in   particular near large adult trees and under a closely related canopy. We   planted oak seedlings in a temperate forest at different distances from   adults and followed seedling mortality, budburst (early budburst   permitting photosynthesis during the best light conditions) and leaf   herbivory. We applied fungicide on half of the seedlings for 2years to   identify the net effect of below-ground fungi on seedlings. We   quantified seedling mycorrhization and fungal-driven decomposition of a   neighbourhood-specific and an unspecific substrate, local oak leaves and   cellulose respectively. Finally, we related mycorrhization and   decomposition to seedling performance. We found that, in seedlings   planted close to conspecific adults, below-ground fungi had a negative   net effect on seedlings: elimination of fungi, surprisingly, decreased   herbivory. This effect could be due to oak leaf decomposition, which was   related to increased seedling herbivory and was higher near a   conspecific adult. Under a closely related canopy, however, the net   effect of below-ground fungi on nearby seedlings became positive:   elimination of fungi delayed budburst. This effect could be due to   colonization by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Cortinarius sp., which   related to accelerated budburst and was higher near a conspecific under   a closely related canopy. Effects of below-ground fungi on nearby   seedlings were not dependent on the size of the conspecific and were   species but not lineage specific. Overall, our results suggest that a   Janzen-Connell-like pattern, that is, increased mortality of seedlings   near conspecific adult, can be (1) induced by specialist decomposers   increasing the nutritional quality of conspecific seedlings to   herbivores, and (2) offset by ectomycorrhizal fungal mutualists under a   closely related canopy.

Chlorella sorokiniana and Scenedesmus   obliquus have been identified to tolerate higher amounts of organic   loading and physiological stresses. Nutrient removal, pathogen removal,   and lipid accumulation with secondary or tertiary effluents have been   demonstrated independently for these organisms. However, their   potentials for accomplishing these objectives simultaneously with raw   sewage have not been investigated. This study presents comprehensive   investigations of applicability of C. sorokiniana and S. obliquus to   wastewater treatment without the requirement for any additional   treatment. S. obliquus showed greater potential for removing organic   carbon (76.13 +/- 1.59\% COD removal), nutrients (98.54 +/- 330\%   N-removal, 97.99 +/- 3.59\% P-removal) and comparable pathogens removal   (99.93 +/- 0.12\% total coliforms removal, 100\% faecal coliform   removal) in comparison to C sorokiniana (69.38 +/- 1.81\% COD removal,   86.93 +/- 3.49\% N-removal, 68.24 +/- 11.69\% P-removal, 99.78 +/-   0.12\% total coliforms removal, 100\% faecal coliform removal) with 15   days of cultivation with filtered raw sewage, but also encountered   increased levels of stress (F-v/F-m of 0.48 +/- 0.03) which accounted   for increased lipid accumulation in the cells (23.26 +/- 3.95\% w/w) but   might also affect their biomass productivity and treatment potential in   longer applications. In comparison, C sorokiniana demonstrated better   adaptability to physiological stresses (F-v/F-m of 0.53 +/- 0.01) and   may be suitable for achieving comprehensive treatment and sufficient   lipid accumulation (22.74 +/- 3.11\% w/w) without compromising these   potentials during prolonged applications.

Consideration of climate change threat is no exception, and recently   numerous approaches to assessing the threat of climate change to species   have been developed. We explored IUCN Red List assessments of amphibians   and birds to determine whether species listed as threatened by climate   change display distinct patterns in terms of habitat occupied and   additional nonclimatic threats faced. We compared IUCN Red List data   with a published data set of species' biological and ecological traits   believed to infer high vulnerability to climate change and determined   whether distributions of climate change-threatened species on the IUCN   Red List concur with those of climate change-threatened species   identified with the trait-based approach and whether species possessing   these traits are more likely to have climate change listed as a threat   on the IUCN Red List. Species in some ecosystems (e.g., grassland,   shrubland) and subject to particular threats (e.g., invasive species)   were more likely to have climate change as a listed threat. Geographical   patterns of climate change-threatened amphibians and birds on the IUCN   Red List were incongruent with patterns of global species richness and   patterns identified using trait-based approaches. Certain traits were   linked to increases or decreases in the likelihood of a species being   threatened by climate change. Broad temperature tolerance of a species   was consistently related to an increased likelihood of climate change   threat, indicating counterintuitive relationships in IUCN assessments.   To improve the robustness of species assessments of the vulnerability or   extinction risk associated with climate change, we suggest IUCN adopt a   more cohesive approach whereby specific traits highlighted by our   results are considered in Red List assessments. To achieve this and to   strengthen the climate change-vulnerability assessments approach, it is   necessary to identify and implement logical avenues for further research   into traits that make species vulnerable to climate change ( including   population-level threats).",673,NO,SH,,,

Here, we show that spatial heterogeneity   in moisture maintains a polymorphism for pungency (heat) among natural   populations of wild chilies (Capsicum chacoense) because traits   influencing water-use efficiency are functionally integrated with traits   controlling pungency (the production of capsaicinoids). Pungent and   non-pungent chilies occur along a cline in moisture that spans their   native range in Bolivia, and the proportion of pungent plants in   populations increases with greater moisture availability. In high   moisture environments, pungency is beneficial because capsaicinoids   protect the fruit from pathogenic fungi, and is not costly because   pungent and non-pungent chilies grown in well-watered conditions produce   equal numbers of seeds. In low moisture environments, pungency is less   beneficial as the risk of fungal infection is lower, and carries a   significant cost because, under drought stress, seed production in   pungent chilies is reduced by 50 per cent relative to non-pungent plants   grown in identical conditions. This large difference in seed production   under water-stressed (WS) conditions explains the existence of   populations dominated by non-pungent plants, and appears to result from   a genetic correlation between pungency and stomatal density: non-pungent   plants, segregating from intra-population crosses, exhibit significantly   lower stomatal density (p = 0.003), thereby reducing gas exchange under   WS conditions. These results demonstrate the importance of trait   integration in constraining adaptive divergence among populations.",674,NO,SH,,,

We evaluated how   freezing stress (temperature at -6 degrees C for 6 h) experienced by   seeds of two conifer species (Pinus resinosa and Pinus strobus) affects   seedling herbivory by a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera exigua). For   both Pinus species, herbivores consumed twofold more seedling biomass   from freeze-thaw-treated plants than seedlings from the constant   temperature treatment. Herbivores grew similar to 66\% faster when   feeding on freeze-thaw P. resinosa seedlings relative to controls, but   herbivore growth rate did not differ between treatments for P. strobus.

Extensive research in the eastern and central United States and in   Scandinavia suggests that fragmentation of formerly continuous forests   and grasslands adversely affects reproductive success of birds, yet   little is known of the potential effects on avian communities in Western   shrublands. I used multi-model inference to evaluate the potential   effects of local and landscape variables on nest predation and brood   parasitism, and behavioral observations of color-banded birds to   evaluate the potential effects of habitat fragmentation on seasonal   reproductive success of passerines in the shrubsteppe of eastern   Washington State, USA. Reproductive success of shrubsteppe-obligate   passerines was lower in landscapes fragmented by agriculture than in   continuous shrubsteppe landscapes. Daily survival rates for nests of   Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri; n = 496) and Sage Thrashers   (Oreoscoptes montanus; n 128) were lower in fragmented landscapes, and   seasonal reproductive success ( percentage of pairs. edging young) of   Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli; n 146) and Brewer's Sparrows ( n 59)   was lower in fragmented landscapes. Rates of parasitism by Brown-headed   Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) overall were low (4\%) but were significantly   greater in fragmented landscapes for Brewer's Sparrows, and parasitism   resulted in fewer young. edged from successful nests. Simple models of   population growth using landscape-specific fecundity and estimates of   adult survival derived from return rates of banded male Sage Sparrows   and Brewer's Sparrows suggest that fragmented shrubsteppe in Washington   may be acting as a population sink for some species.

A new closed loop heating system was developed to enhance   the temperature of compost piles, and accelerate the inactivation of   pathogens during the process. The system involved a heated bath   circulator, an air injector, and a system of copper piping used as heat   exchangers in bins. The system was tested under aerated, static, and   plowed composting conditions. To test the pathogen inactivation in the   composting, the concentrations of Salmonella and Escherichia coli in   compost were measured. In addition, the changes in C:N ratio, pH, and   moisture content were observed to understand the quality of the compost   in terms of nutrient concentrations. Results showed that the Salmonella   levels reached to non-detectable limit in 34, 5, and 34 days of   composting in aerated, static, and plowed composting system,   respectively. The E. coli levels were detectable till day 70 indicating   longer survival of E. coli cells compared to Salmonella under composting   environment. In the current system, feedstock C:N ratio was reduced by   71, 70, and 62\% in static, plowed, and aerated composting,   respectively.

We used both   mathematical and agent-based models to reveal how variations in   extrinsic mortality affect prokaryotic genome evolution. Our results   suggest that the genome size of bacteria increases with increased   mortality. A high extrinsic mortality increases the pool of free   resources and shortens life expectancy, which selects for faster   reproduction, a phenotype we called ` scramblers'. This phenotype is   realised by the expansion of gene families involved in nutrient   acquisition and metabolism. In contrast, a low mortality rate increases   an individual's life expectancy, which results in natural selection   favouring tolerance to starvation when conditions are unfavourable. This   leads to the evolution of small, streamlined genomes ('stayers'). Our   models predict that large genomes, gene family expansion and horizontal   gene transfer should be observed in prokaryotes occupying ecosystems   exposed to high abiotic stress, as well as those under strong   predator-and/or pathogenmediated selection.

Clear signals of lineage-specific adaptive   evolution of protein-coding sequences are identified, notably targeting   elements of biotic defence, including both physical and chemical   adaptations in the context of divergent pools of pathogens and   herbivores. In turn, a substantial regulatory divergence between the two   species appears linked to adaptation/acclimation to abiotic conditions.   Several of the pathways affected by differential expression are also   targeted by deviating post-transcriptional regulation via sRNAs.   Finally, D. incarnata appears to suffer from insufficient sRNA control   over the activity of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, resulting in   increased activity of class I transposable elements and, over time, in   larger genome size than that of D. fuchsii. The extensive molecular   divergence between the two species suggests significant genomic and   transcriptomic shock in their hybrids and offers insights into the   difficulty of coexistence at the homoploid level.

In agri-environmental schemes, introducing the hemiparasite   Rhinanthus has therefore been suggested as a low-cost method to increase   grassland plant diversity, which is still subject to debate.   The majority of previous studies simply compared sites with and without   hemiparasites. However, as hemiparasite effects are most likely   density-dependent, we present a novel approach assessing the effect of   Rhinanthus alectorolophus density on grassland plant diversity, yield   and community biomass quality. Moreover, we investigated whether   functional plant composition and community mean traits are affected by   Rhinanthus density, which has been largely neglected in previous   studies.   The relationship between species richness and relative Rhinanthus   biomass followed an optimum curve with highest values at 31\% relative   Rhinanthus biomass. At this Rhinanthus-biomass level, species richness   was increased by 12\% and yield decreased by 26\% compared with plots   without Rhinanthus. M relative Rhinanthus biomass > 60\%, species   richness was even lower than in plots without Rhinanthus. Overall, the   biomass of grasses and the cumulative cover of legumes decreased   linearly with increasing relative Rhinanthus biomass. Community mean   trait analysis revealed that an increasing Rhinanthus density shifts the   community composition towards smaller plant species.

Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are major pests in the semiarid   grasslands of eastern South Island. As the benefits of a viral   biological control agent (rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus) introduced   in 1997 begin to wane, landowners are again faced with the costs of   controlling rabbits.   Aim. The study aimed to measure the extent of vegetation growth as   rabbit and sheep densities changed to enable land managers to better   justify decisions on pest and stock management.   Methods. We investigated the relationship between seasonal growth of   vegetation at two replicate sites within each of three rabbit-prone   areas in Otago. At these sites, the ambient densities of lagomorphs   varied naturally and in response to pest-control operations, whereas the   density of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) varied according to the farmers'   husbandry needs. The vegetation was highly degraded at one of the areas   studied. Rabbits were present at all three sites and hares (Lepus   europaeus) at two sites. At each site, we established exclosures that   excluded either all herbivores or just sheep. The observed rates of   vegetation growth were modelled as a function of prevailing herbivore   densities, season and site. The fitted model was used to infer expected   rates of change in vegetation biomass at the sites, under varying sheep   and lagomorph density indices, and seasons.   Key results. In the absence of herbivores, vegetation was predicted to   grow in all seasons apart from winter at the degraded sites. In the   absence of sheep but in the presence of up to similar to 10 lagomorphs   seen per kilometre of spotlight transect, accumulation of vegetation   biomass follows the same seasonal pattern as in the absence of   herbivores. As lagomorph counts reach 50 per kilometre, vegetation   biomass accumulates only in spring and summer and only at the least   degraded sites. The maximum stocking rates for sheep for which positive   biomass accumulation could be maintained under varying lagomorph   densities was predicted from the model.   Conclusions. At the least degraded sites some sheep could be grazed   while maintaining positive pasture growth, even at high rabbit   densities, except in winter if rabbit-density indices exceeded similar   to 30 per kilometre. At the most degraded sites, a very low density of   sheep could be maintained, but only in spring and only if lagomorph   density indices were below similar to 10 per kilometre.",682,NO,SH,,,

Prior to reaching   Australia, severe damage from P. psidii was mainly restricted to exotic   eucalypt plantations in South America, guava plantations in Brazil,   allspice plantations in Jamaica, and exotic Myrtaceous tree species in   the USA; the only previous record of widespread damage in native   environments is of endangered Eugenia koolauensis in Hawai'i. Using two   rainforest tree species as indicators of the impact of P. psidii, we   report for the first time severe damage to endemic Myrtaceae in native   forests in Australia, after only 4 years' exposure to P. psidii. A   3-year disease exclusion trial in a natural stand of Rhodamnia rubescens   unequivocally showed that repeated, severe infection leads to gradual   crown loss and ultimately tree mortality; trees were killed in less than   4 years.

Specifically in the Alps in Switzerland, the temperature   has increased twice as fast than in the rest of the Northern hemisphere.   Water temperature closely follows the annual air temperature cycle,   severely impacting streams and freshwater ecosystems.   In the last 20 years, brown trout (Salmo trutta L) catch has declined by   approximately 40-50\% in many rivers in Switzerland. Increasing water   temperature has been suggested as one of the most likely cause of this   decline. Temperature has a direct effect on trout population dynamics   through developmental and disease control but can also indirectly impact   dynamics via food-web interactions such as resource availability.   We developed a spatially explicit modelling framework that allows   spatial and temporal projections of trout biomass using the Aare river   catchment as a model system, in order to assess the spatial and seasonal   patterns of trout biomass variation. Given that biomass has a seasonal   variation depending on trout life history stage, we developed seasonal   biomass variation models for three periods of the year (Autumn-Winter,   Spring and Summer). Because stream water temperature is a critical   parameter for brown trout development, we first calibrated a model to   predict water temperature as a function of air temperature to be able to   further apply climate change scenarios. We then built a model of trout   biomass variation by linking water temperature to trout biomass   measurements collected by electro-fishing in 21 stations from 2009 to   2011.   The different modelling components of our framework had overall a good   predictive ability and we could show a seasonal effect of water   temperature affecting trout biomass variation. Our statistical framework   uses a minimum set of input variables that make it easily transferable   to other study areas or fish species but could be improved by including   effects of the biotic environment and the evolution of demographical   parameters over time. However, our framework still remains informative   to spatially highlight where potential changes of water temperature   could affect trout biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Biocides have a longer use in clinical practice than   antibiotics, and a qac (quaternary ammonium compound) resistance gene,   or remnant thereof, is a normal feature of class 1 integrons recovered   from clinical isolates. Consequently, it is possible that the initial   selective advantage was conferred by resistance to biocides, mediated by   qac. Here, we show that diverse qac gene cassettes are a dominant   feature of cassette arrays from environmental class 1 integrons, and   that they occur in the absence of any antibiotic resistance gene   cassettes. They are present in arrays that are dynamic, acquiring and   rearranging gene cassettes within the arrays. The abundance of qac gene   cassettes makes them a likely candidate for participation in the   original insertion into Tn402, and as a source of a readily selectable   phenotype.

Thus, runoff and flooding   from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more   significantly.

From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2\%) and   Arcobacter (4.5\%) were detected, which could potentially compromise   wetlands functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern   and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife   management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of   concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline   safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water.

However, some hosts have   evolved the ability to silence TE activity, whereas others have not. We   are investigating the population dynamics of TE host-silencing pathways,   particularly copia long terminal repeat retrotransposon in Drosophila   melanogaster. Here, we identify large effect genes involved in copia   suppression by using a semi-quantitative analysis to assay levels of   copia plasmids (believed to be an intermediate of transposition) in 98   recombinant inbred lines constructed from a line exhibiting high copia   transpositions and a line exhibiting no transpositions. The results   revealed that the influence of copia copy number and transcription level   on copia plasmid concentrations are weak and that genomic factors,   presumably encoded by the host, have stronger effects on transposition   rates. We mapped a QTL affecting copia plasmid concentration within the   33A-43E cytological region of the second chromosome and applied a   quantitative deficiency complementation analysis on this chromosomal   region. One out of the two large effect deficiencies on copia plasmid   concentrations corresponded to the vasa gene, an important component of   the nuage-piwi RNA TE-silencing machinery. We hypothesize that copia   suppression occurs by the joint action of several post-transcriptional   mechanisms with at least one of the blocks taking place in the nuage.

In a system undergoing intense plant invasion   for 25 years, we investigated patterns of community change at a regional   scale. Specifically, we sought to quantify how tussock grassland plant   community structure had changed and whether changes were related to   increases in plant invasion. Frequency data for all vascular plants were   recorded on 124, permanent transects in tussock grasslands across the   lower eastern South Island of New Zealand measured three times over a   period of 25 years. Multivariate analyses of species richness were used   to describe spatial and temporal patterns in the vegetation. Linear   mixed-effects models were used to relate temporal changes in community   structure to the level and rate of invasion of three dominant invasive   species in the genus Hieracium while accounting for relationships with   other biotic and abiotic variables. There was a strong compositional   gradient from exotic- to native-dominated plant communities that   correlated with increasing elevation. Over the 25 years, small-scale   species richness significantly decreased and then increased again;   however, these changes differed in different plant communities. Exotic   species frequency consistently increased on some transects and   consistently declined on others. Species richness changes were   correlated with the level of Hieracium invasion and abiotic factors,   although the relationship with Hieracium changed from negative to   positive over time. Compositional changes were not related to measured   predictors. Our results suggest that observed broad-scale fluctuations   in species richness and community composition dynamics were not driven   by Hieracium invasion. Given the relatively minor changes in community   composition over time, we conclude that there is no evidence for   widespread degradation of these grasslands over the last 25 years.   However, because of continuing weed invasion, particularly at lower   elevations, impacts may emerge in the longer term.",688,NO,SH,,,

Their decline is often characterized by sudden ecosystem collapse   from a vegetated to a bare state. In the 1930s, such a dramatic event   happened in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Before the shift, large seagrass beds   (Zostera marina) were present in this area. After the construction of a   large dam and an incidence of the ``wasting disease'' in the early   1930s, these meadows became virtually extinct and never recovered   despite restoration attempts. We investigated whether this shift could   be explained as a critical transition between alternative stable states,   and whether the lack of recovery could be due to the high resilience of   the new turbid state. We analyzed the depth distribution of the   historical meadows, a long-term dataset of key factors determining   turbidity and a minimal model based on these data. Results demonstrate   that recovery was impossible because turbidity related to suspended   sediment was too high, probably because turbidity was no longer reduced   by seagrass itself. Model simulations on the positive feedback suggest   indeed the robust occurrence of alternative stable states and a high   resilience of the current turbid state. As positive feedbacks are common   in seagrasses, our findings may explain both the worldwide observed   collapses and the low success rate of restoration attempts of seagrass   habitats. Therefore, appreciation of ecosystem resilience may be crucial   in seagrass ecosystem management.",690,NO,SH,,,

In the northeastern   Caribbean, French grunts are known to be infected by Anilocra haemuli,   one of the largest and most conspicuous ectoparasitic isopods. Studies   on Anilocra infection have demonstrated that infection reduces host   swimming performance and condition and may alter host behavior. We   tested predictions of the hypothesis that A. haemuli infection   influences the movement patterns of host French grunt, specifically   whether short-distance daytime movements and/or reef-seagrass migration   at dusk was associated with infection. We conducted focal observations   on infected and uninfected fish during both daytime resting and dusk   migration periods. We also conducted daytime and nocturnal surveys in   reef habitat, documenting changes in the proportion of infected   individuals. We found that infected fish move significantly less than   uninfected conspecifics during the day and observed 100 \% of uninfected   focal fish and 37.5 \% of infected focal fish departing the reef during   dusk. In reef habitat, the proportion of fish infected with Anilocra was   also significantly greater at night compared to daytime.

This makes the understanding of the underlying mechanisms to symbiotic   individuals frequency in local populations much more interesting. Most   studies have been focused on the differential fitness between symbiotic   and non-symbiotic counterparts (relative fitness), barely considering   other mechanisms. We performed a microcosms experiment to evaluate   whether grazing alters the dynamics of the endophyte Neotyphodium   occultans in the annual grass Lolium multiflorum by simultaneously   modifying the relative fitness and the endophyte efficiency to be   transmitted from host plants to seeds. Grazing was simulated by means of   clipping and trampling on symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants growing   separately, in soils obtained from paddocks, differing in their   agronomic management history (natural grassland vs. ryegrass promotion).   Seed production showed a complex pattern as it depended on the symbiotic   status of the plants, the level of grazing and the agro-ecological   context. Grazed plants produced three times fewer seeds than ungrazed   plants only in microcosms with endophyte-symbiotic plants in soils from   ryegrass promotion. Endophyte benefits on seed production were   exclusively observed in ungrazed plants in the same soil. Symbiotic   plants produced symbiotic and non-symbiotic seeds in all the treatments.   While the production of non-symbiotic seeds by these plants was not   affected by grazing and the soil, grazing reduced the production of   symbiotic seeds in both contexts. Grazing negative effect on the density   of fully infected spikes determined a significant increment in the   transmission failures which were not modified by agro-ecological   contexts. Therefore, grazing can modulate symbiosis dynamics through   reducing seed production and endophyte transmission efficiency.   Transmission has been disregarded, but it is a context-dependent process   that could lead to a gradual reduction in the symbiotic plants frequency   in a population if the mutualism effectiveness does not outweigh   transmission failures.",692,NO,SH,,,

These effects can   persist following removal of the invasive plant and, combined with   effects of removal per se, influence subsequent plant communities and   ecosystem functioning. We used field observations and a soil bioassay   with multiple plant species to determine the belowground effects and   post-removal legacy caused by invasion of the non-native tree Pinus   contorta into a native plant community. Pinus facilitated   ectomycorrhizal infection of the co-occurring invasive tree, Pseudotsuga   menziesii, but not conspecific Pinus (which always had ectomycorrhizas)   nor the native pioneer Kunzea ericoides (which never had   ectomycorrhizas). Pinus also caused a major shift in soil nutrient   cycling as indicated by increased bacterial dominance, NO3-N (17-fold   increase) and available phosphorus (3.2-fold increase) in soils, which   in turn promoted increased growth of graminoids. These results parallel   field observations, where Pinus removal is associated with invasion by   non-native grasses and herbs, and suggest that legacies of Pinus on soil   nutrient cycling thus indirectly promote invasion of other non-native   plant species.

Here we examine   whether a trematode parasite (Microphallus spp.) can contribute to   previously documented alternate states in the abundance of invasive   rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) in north temperate lakes in   Wisconsin, USA. Microphallus infect O. rusticus after emerging from   their first intermediate host, a hydrobiid snail. As previously   documented, O. rusticus reduce densities of hydrobiid snails through   direct predation and destruction of macrophyte habitat. Therefore, if   Microphallus substantially reduce O. rusticus fitness, these parasites   may reinforce a state of low crayfish abundance, and, at the other   extreme, abundant crayfish may repress these parasites, reinforcing a   state of high crayfish abundance. From samples collected from 109 sites   in 16 lakes, we discovered (1) a positive relationship between crayfish   infection intensity and hydrobiid snail abundance, (2) a negative   relationship between parasite prevalence and crayfish abundance, and (3)   a negative relationship between parasite prevalence and crayfish   population growth. With experiments, we found that infection with   Microphallus reduced foraging behavior and growth in O. rusticus, which   may be the mechanisms responsible for the population reductions we   observed.

Viruses and bacteria were rapidly adsorbed   to BC. No difference between the effect of irradiated and non-irradiated   BC on free viral parameters was observed. Bacterial leucine   incorporation was higher in the BC treatments than in the BC-free   controls. The stimulated bacterial production in the dark BC treatments   might be caused by the reduction of viral infection due to adsorption of   organic material or by direct use of BC material. Viral production was   significantly lower in BC-amended treatments than in BC-free controls,   and the estimated fraction of infected cells decreased with increasing   BC concentration. Moreover, bacterial activity in the   solar-radiation-exposed BC treatments was higher than in the dark BC   treatments, indicating that radiation made BC more accessible to   bacteria. Our data reveal that BC has the potential to stimulate   bacterial activity in the water column, particularly after exposure to   solar radiation.

We investigated the effects of aspergillosis, an   infectious disease caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus sydowii, on   the demography of a gorgonian coral, Gorgonia ventalina. Caribbean sea   fans were affected by a seven-year epizootic, marked by an initial   period in 1994 of high infection prevalence, high mortality rates, and   almost complete reproductive failure of infected fans. Post epizootic,   in 2005, host populations were relatively healthy, with low disease   prevalence.   Using longitudinal data from populations on coral reefs in the Florida   Keys (USA) and the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico), we documented changes in   the epidemiology of sea fan aspergillosis over the course of the   epizootic. We developed an ``integral projection model'' that scales   disease impacts from individual to population levels using direct   estimates of vital rates. Within-colony lesion growth rate and host   mortality were higher during the peak of the epizootic. Effects on   individuals and populations changed substantially post-epizootic;   recruitment increased, mortality of infected adults decreased, and the   size dependence of infection was reduced. Elasticity analysis indicated   that population growth is more sensitive to changes in the growth and   survival of established colonies than to recruitment, due to slow colony   growth and the longevity and fecundity of large adults.   Disease prevalence in our monitored populations decreased from similar   to 50\% in 1997 to <10\% by 2003 and <1\% in 2007 and was accompanied by   very high mortality during the early stages of the epizootic. The   population model suggested that host evolution (due to selection for   higher disease resistance through differential mortality) could proceed   quickly enough to explain the observed changes in prevalence and in the   size independence of infection risk. Our model indicates that the time   required for population recovery following an outbreak is largely   determined by the percentage of healthy tissue lost from the population.

An examination of the literature on   C. dromedarius diseases, such as camel pox virus, contagious ecthyma and   papillomatosis, indicates that the infections generally result in high   morbidity but not necessarily mortality and this alone may not justify   their consideration for use in Australia. The possibility exists that   other undiscovered or unstudied biological control agents from other   camilid species may offer greater potential for population control. As a   long-lived species the camel is also not ideally suited to fertility   control. Notwithstanding, anti-fertility agents may have their place in   preventing the re-establishment of camel populations once they have been   reduced through mechanical, biological or chemical means.

Gardens contained agricultural crops, food   production infrastructure, ornamental plants, and recreational areas in   varying proportions, indicating that gardens serve multiple and distinct   purposes depending on community needs and interests. On average,   gardeners devoted the greatest proportion of garden area (44 \%) to food   production, and supplied a large share of their households' produce   needs from their community gardens. Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, and   Cucurbitaceae crops dominated food crop areas, hindering effective crop   rotation to prevent disease and pest problems. Most gardeners grew crops   in raised beds constructed with clean fill and compost. These soils   generally had sandy textures, low water-holding capacity, high organic   matter levels (with a large proportion from recent inputs) and excessive   nutrient levels. Soil water content at field capacity increased   exponentially with total soil carbon, suggesting that organic matter   enhances water-holding capacity. Insect pest densities greatly exceeded   action thresholds in nearly all gardens for aphids and whiteflies on   Brassica crops, aphids on Cucurbit crops, and two-spotted spider mites   on tomatoes. Predator and parasitoid densities were generally low (less   than one per plant on average), perhaps partially due to low floral and   woody perennial cover in most gardens (12 \% and 9 \% on average,   respectively). Dominant groups of natural enemies were minute pirate   bugs, spiders, and parasitoid wasps. A wide variety of people of   differing experience levels, incomes, and ethnicities participate in   community gardening in NYC, and most gardens host multiple languages.   Promising directions for urban gardening research, education, and   practice include: 1) Cover cropping to improve soil quality and nutrient   management, and diversify crop rotations; 2) Improving access to soil   testing and guidance on appropriate use of soil amendments, 3) Enhancing   habitat for arthropod natural enemies that provide biological control of   insect pests with floral and woody perennial plantings; and 4)   Incorporating ecological knowledge and inquiry-based approaches into   gardening workshops, educational materials, and technical support, and   offering these resources in multiple languages.",703,NO,SH,,,

In one   village of Senegal (near Thies) it was reported that farmers planted   mango (Mangifera indica) seedlings within the canopies of a native shrub   (Piliostigma reticulatum). Anecdotal information and qualitative   observations suggested that the presence of P. reticulatum promoted soil   quality and a competitive advantage for establishing mango plantations.   We hypothesized that soil chemical and microbial properties of mango   rhizosphere soil growing in the presence of P. reticulatum would be   significantly improved over soils associated with mango growing outside   the influence of P. reticulatum. The results showed that mango-shrub   interplanting significantly lowered pH, and increased arbuscular   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization of mango roots, enzyme activities,   and microbial biomass compared to mango alone. Phylogenetic analyses by   PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that community   structures of fungi, bacteria, and bacterial genes responsible for   denitrification (nirK) of the soil from the rooting zone of the   mango-shrub intercropping system were distinct from all other soil   outside the influence of P. reticulatum. It is concluded that P.   reticulatum enhances soil biological functioning and that there is a   synergistic effect of intercropping mango with the native shrub, P.   reticulatum, in soil quality with a more diverse community, greater AMF   infection rates, and greater potential to perform decomposition and   mineralize nutrients.

"L. A. Levin, J. A. Crooks",2011,Functional Consequences of Invasive Species in Coastal and Estuarine   Systems,NA,17-51,17-51,NA,"Rapid change is a major feature of modern estuaries and coasts. In   numerous systems, invasive species are a primary force altering the   structure and function of communities. Nonindigenous species take on   nearly all possible ecological roles, serving as agents of disease,   parasites, primary and secondary producers, predators, competitors,   facilitators, and disturbers. Here, major functional impacts are   assessed by considering invasive species as nutrient and biogeochemical   modifiers, trophic transformers, and structural engineers. Both plant   and animal invasions have the ability to dramatically alter habitat   properties and energy flows, shifting ecosystems from one type or state   to another, with different functional attributes. Invaders can also   impact longer-term, evolutionary dynamics through alteration of   selection regimes and hybridization. The ecosystem-level consequences   involve changes to emergent structural and functional properties and to   ecosystem services. Biodiversity, spatial heterogeneity, connectivity,   succession, stability, and resilience all may be modified by invasion.   Ecological impacts are often heavily intertwined with ecosystem   services, in terms of both positive and negative consequences for   humans. Invaders play key roles in fisheries, aquaculture, shoreline   stabilization, remediation and restoration, and carbon sequestration.   Several decades of invasion research allow us to identify the settings   most likely to experience highly modified functions when invaded, and to   synthesize the nature and magnitude of invasion effects on ecosystem   function.",705,NO,SH,,,

The drivers behind plant competition and diversity have long been   debated, and there is acceptance that soil micro-organisms may act as   key drivers in plant interactions and community structure. The evidence   for a microbial role in shaping plant interactions and communities will   be considered here with emphasis on symbionts and pathogens.   2. Microbial populations are themselves strongly influenced by the plant   community via the `rhizosphere' effect. The rhizosphere community   includes microbes both beneficial and detrimental to the plant. Both the   ability of plants to cultivate different rhizosphere microbial   populations and the resulting impact upon other plant species have   largely been studied via `plant-soil' feedback studies, a proxy   necessitated by the fact the majority of soil microorganisms are   unculturable, but which nevertheless has rarely been used in conjunction   with modern techniques to identify and quantify the micro-organisms   involved.   3. Both microbial symbionts and pathogens can affect plant diversity and   productivity, but the direct evidence for impacts on competitive   interactions is surprisingly scarce. Evidence comes from biological   invasions, the unintentional introduction of microbial pathogens to   native plant communities and manipulative experiments under both field   and controlled conditions. Pathogens generally have direct effects on   plants, reducing their growth and so rendering them less competitive,   whereas other symbionts may act by altering the availability of   resources, with more subtle effects on competitive interactions.   4. Some of the best evidence for indirect effects comes from studies on   arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. New developments in our understanding   of nutrient exchange in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis emphasize   the need to view the fungal partners not as mere extensions of the   plant. The suggestion that AM fungi may act to share resources among   connected plants however remains to be proved.   5. Although plant competitive interactions can be driven by key   microbial groups including symbionts and pathogens, knowledge gaps in   the basic biology of these micro-organisms has hindered a full   mechanistic understanding of these processes. If ecologists now embrace   new technologies, significant advances in this area should be   forthcoming.",706,YES,SH,no,review,

The response   by the bacterial community may be to become more predation resistant in   highly productive environments. To test this hypothesis, samples were   taken from 20 aquatic systems along a productivity gradient (dissolved   organic carbon from 7 to 71 mg/L), during late summer. The results   showed that the biomass of bacteria, phytoplankton, and ciliates   increased along the gradient (r(2)=0.532, 0.426, and 0.758, P < 0.01,   respectively). However, the organisms did not increase equally, and the   ratio of protozoan to bacterial biomass showed a 100-fold increase along   the gradient. Ciliates dominated the protozoan biomass in the more   nutrient-rich waters. The edibility of colony-forming bacteria was   tested using a ciliate predator, Tetrahymena pyriformis. Bacterial   edibility was found to decrease with increases in nutrient richness and   ciliate biomass in the aquatic systems (r(2)=0.358, P < 0.01;   r(2)=0.242, P < 0.05, respectively). Quantile regression analysis   indicated that the selection pressures on edible bacteria were   increasing along the productivity gradient. Thus, inedible forms of   bacteria were selected for in the transition from oligotrophic to   eutrophic conditions. Isolated bacteria were distributed among the   alpha-, beta-, and gamma- Proteobacteria and the Actinobacteria and   Firmicutes taxa. We conclude that bacterial predation resistance   increases in nutrient-rich waters with high protozoan predation.",707,NO,SH,,,

Amphibians are in decline, and the disease chytridiomycosis, caused   by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been   repeatedly implicated throughout the world. This chytrid reproduces via   an infectious, motile zoospore stage that remains viable for weeks in   the water column.   2. Daphnia is a keystone zooplankton grazer in intact freshwater   ecosystems, whose importance to amphibians may be overlooked. As an   efficient grazer, Daphnia can suppress chytrid epidemics by consuming   zoospores and may therefore play a role in Bd infection dynamics.   Daphnia may also have important effects on tadpoles by mediating the   properties of pond food webs. We tested the role of Daphnia in outdoor   mesocosms containing the tadpoles of red-legged frogs (Rana aurora)   infected with Bd. We also tested the ability of Daphnia to filter Bd   from the water column in laboratory microcosms.   3. In the water of microcosms, Daphnia dramatically decreased the number   of Bd genomic equivalents detectable using quantitative PCR. Bd genomic   equivalents fell below the limit of detection at very high (>1 Daphnia   mL(-1)) Daphnia densities.   4. In mesocosms, Daphnia was critical to the development of tadpoles: in   the presence of Daphnia, tadpoles were twofold heavier at metamorphosis   than in their absence. Daphnia and Bd interacted to affect the tadpole   survival: survival was highest in the presence of Daphnia and in the   absence of Bd. We were unable to detect an effect of Daphnia on the   transmission of Bd in mesocosms. However, Bd transmission among the   tadpoles in mesocosms was unexpectedly low, limiting our power to detect   an effect of Daphnia on transmission.   5. Tadpole dissection showed that tadpoles also consumed large numbers   of Daphnia. Current models of mesocosm food webs that assume no   predation by tadpoles on zooplankton therefore probably overlook   important features of both natural and experimental systems.",708,MAYBE,SH,yes,,

We   conducted a microcosm experiment using a size fractionation approach to   manipulate grazers, with a purpose to examine the effects of inorganic   and organic nutrients on viral and prokaryotic standing stocks and   activities, and on prokaryotic community composition as assessed by   fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method. Experiments were   performed during periods of severe phosphate (P)-limiting conditions in   the oligotrophic Sep Reservoir (Massif Central, France). In the absence   of nutrient addition, the presence of grazers in microcosms stimulated   prokaryotic growth and viral proliferation, likely through nutrient and   substrate enrichment. Addition of nutrients had a stronger effect on   viral infection of prokaryotes than grazing. Addition of P led to the   most pronounced increase in prokaryotic abundance, production and growth   efficiency, thus providing direct evidence of P limitation of   prokaryotes. Enhanced prokaryotic activity in P treatments also   stimulated viral abundance and viral-induced lyses of prokaryotes.   Changes in prokaryotic community composition due to nutrient additions   were evident in the grazer-free samples. Prokaryotic populations   hybridizing for the probes bacteria, beta-Proteobacteria and   alpha-Proteobacteria responded to nutrient enrichment with significant   increases in their relative abundances, whereas cells hybridizing for   Archaea and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium (now known as Bacteroidetes) probes   failed to show any functional response. Cells hybridizing for the latter   cluster increased towards the end of incubation period in the control   samples (that is, without nutrient additions) with grazers present,   suggesting the development of grazing resistant forms.

Aims of this study were to: identify the larvae of C.   osculatum (s. l.) recovered in fish hosts during the XXVII Italian   Expedition to Antarctica (2011-2012); perform a comparative analysis of   the contemporary parasitic load and genetic variability estimates of C.   osculatum sp.

Statistically significant differences were found between the occurrence   of C. osculatum sp. D and C. osculatum sp. E in different fish species.   C. osculatum sp. E was more prevalent in T. bernacchii; while, a higher   percentage of C. osculatum sp. D occurred in Ch. hamatus and T. hansoni.   The two species also showed differences in the host infection site: C.   osculatum sp. D showed higher percentage of infection in the fish liver.   High genetic variability values at both nuclear and mitochondrial level   were found in the two species in both sampling periods. The parasitic   infection levels by C. osculatum sp. D and sp.

Our results indicated that average interspecific   root - root distances for the majority of species were within a distance   (3mm) that roots have been shown to compete for resources. Most species   placed their roots at random, although low root numbers for many species   probably led to overestimating the occurrence of random patterns.

Disease intensity caused by both rust fungi decreased   significantly with growing species richness of species mixtures. The   response to the diversity gradient was related to the decreased density   and size of the host individuals with increasing species richness. The   occurrence of other grass species known to be possible hosts of the   pathogens in the experimental mixtures did not promote disease intensity   in L. perenne, indicating that there was a high host specificity of   pathogen strains. Differences in pathogen susceptibility among perennial   ryegrass cultivars persisted independent of diversity treatment, host   density and host individual size, but resulted in a cultivar- specific   pattern of changes in pathogen infestation across the species-richness   gradient. Our study provided evidence that within-species variation in   pathogen susceptibility and competitive interactions of the host species   with the environment, as caused by species diversity treatments, are key   determinants of the occurrence and severity of fungal diseases.",719,NO,SH,,,

Here, we utilized single-cell   sequencing to obtain genomic blueprints of viruses inside or attached to   individual bacterial and archaeal cells captured in their native   environment, circumventing the need for host and virus cultivation. A   combination of comparative genomics, metagenomic fragment recruitment,   sequence anomalies and irregularities in sequence coverage depth and   genome recovery were utilized to detect viruses and to decipher modes of   virus-host interactions. Members of all three tailed phage families were   identified in 20 out of 58 phylogenetically and geographically diverse   single amplified genomes (SAGs) of marine bacteria and archaea. At least   four phage-host interactions had the characteristics of late lytic   infections, all of which were found in metabolically active cells. One   virus had genetic potential for lysogeny. Our findings include first   known viruses of Thaumarchaeota, Marinimicrobia, Verrucomicrobia and   Gammaproteobacteria clusters SAR86 and SAR92. Viruses were also found in   SAGs of Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. A high fragment   recruitment of viral metagenomic reads confirmed that most of the   SAG-associated viruses are abundant in the ocean.

Small-scale investigations provide compelling evidence of specific   effects of global change on local systems, but are of limited use in   modeling complex ecological processes at continental-to-global scales.   Long-term observations distributed across a diversity of habitat types   are needed to improve the ability to forecast ecological change at large   spatial and temporal scales. This special issue introduces the   Terrestrial Observation System (TOS) of the National Ecological   Observatory Network (NEON), a long-term, continental-scale ecological   research platform designed to deliver these large-scale datasets. The   TOS measures biodiversity of key biota (soil microbes, insects, plants,   small mammals), ecosystem productivity and biogeochemistry, infectious   disease dynamics, phenology, and population dynamics. The articles in   this special issue describe the scientific rationale for the sampling   designs of the TOS, including an overview of protocols, locations, and   frequencies of measurements. The science designs are a culmination of   design requirements scoped by NEON and the National Science Foundation,   best available practices put forth by the scientific community, input   from technical working groups, and consideration of logistical and   financial constraints by NEON staff. Within each site, measurements have   been collocated to the extent possible to optimize linkages among   different sampling elements. Integrated analyses of terrestrial   observations with sensor-based, imagery, and remote-sensing data   collected by other NEON subsystems can facilitate scaling of measured   parameters to larger spatial and temporal scales. NEON is designed to   collect data for 30 years, and make these data freely available on a   public data portal (data.neonscience.org). Samples and specimens will be   archived and available to the scientific community upon request. The   open access approach to the Observatory will provide users with the   resources necessary to map, understand, and predict the effects of   global change drivers on ecological processes at a continental scale.",721,NO,SH,,,

However, despite the ubiquity of parasites in most food webs,   comparisons of the nutritional quality of prey as a function of   infection status are largely absent. We measured the nutritional   consequences of chytridiomycete infections in Daphnia, which achieve   high prevalence in lake ecosystems (> 80\%), and tested the hypothesis   that Daphnia pulicaria infected with Polycaryum laeve are diminished in   food quality relative to uninfected hosts. Compared with uninfected   adults, infected individuals were smaller, contained less nitrogen and   phosphorus, and were lower in several important fatty acids. Infected   zooplankton had significantly shorter carapace lengths (8\%) and lower   mass (8-20\%) than uninfected individuals. Parasitized animals contained   significantly less phosphorus (16-18\% less by dry mass) and nitrogen   (4-6\% less) than did healthy individuals. Infected individuals also   contained 26-34\% less saturated fatty acid and 31-42\% less   docosahexaenoic acid, an essential fatty acid that is typically low in   cladocera, but critical to fish growth. Our results suggest that   naturally occurring levels of chytrid infections in D. pulicaria   populations reduce the quality of food available to secondary consumers,   including planktivorous fishes, with potentially important effects for   lake food webs.",722,YES,SH,yes,,

Both experiments and   quantitative modeling are fundamental to the design of sustainable   agroecosystems and the optimization of crop production. We modeled   communities of perennial crop mixtures by using a generalized   Lotka-Volterra model, i.e., a model such that the interspecific   interactions are more general than purely competitive. We estimated   model parameters -carrying capacities and interaction coefficients-   from, respectively, the observed biomass of monocultures and bicultures   measured in a large diversity experiment of seven perennial forage   species in Iowa, United States. The sign and absolute value of the   interaction coefficients showed that the biological interactions between   species pairs included amensalism, competition, and parasitism   (asymmetric positive-negative interaction), with various degrees of   intensity. We tested the model fit by simulating the combinations of   more than two species and comparing them with the polycultures   experimental data. Overall, theoretical predictions are in good   agreement with the experiments. Using this model, we also simulated   species combinations that were not sown.

On one   hand, various strategies allow kelps prevent frond surface fouling which   would retard growth by reducing photosynthesis and increasing   pathogenesis. On the other hand, production and release of organic   exudates of high energy value, sometimes in association with more or   less selective control of settlement of epiphytic strains, allow   bacteria to establish surface consortia not leading to macrofouling.   Here, we present the analysis of adhesion and biofilm formation of   bacterial isolates from the kelp Laminaria digitata and of characterized   and referenced marine isolates. When they were grown in flow cell under   standard nutrient regimes, all used bacteria, except one, were able to   adhere on glass and then develop as biofilms, with different   architecture. Then, we evaluated the effect of extracts from undisturbed   young Laminaria thalli and from young thalli subjected to oxidative   stress elicitation; this latter condition induced the production of   defense molecules. We observed increasing or decreasing adhesion   depending on the referenced strains, but no effects were observed   against strains isolated from L. digitata. Such effects were less   observed on biofilms. Our results suggested that L. digitata is able to   modulate its bacterial colonization. Finally, mannitol, a regular   surface active component of Laminaria exudates was tested individually,   and it showed a pronounced increased on one biofilm strain. Results of   these experiments are original and can be usefully linked to what we   already know on the oxidative halogen metabolism peculiar to Laminaria.

Predator population growth may be   positive when conspecific density is low but predators also need areas   with prey availability, associated with competition, which increases the   risk of suffering losses but stabilises populations. We studied   relationships between European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus (prey) and   adult eagle owls Bubo bubo (predators) in south-western Europe. We   assessed models explaining the predator population growth and stability.   We estimated the abundance of rabbits and adult eagle owls during three   years in eight localities of central-southern Spain. We explored models   including rabbit and adult eagle owl abundance, accounting for yearly   variations and including the locality as a random variable. We found   that population growth of adult eagle owls was positive in situations   with low conspecific abundance and tended to be negative but approaching   equilibrium in situations of higher conspecific abundance. Population   growth was also positively related to previous summer rabbit density   when taking into account eagle owl conspecific abundance, possibly   indicating that rabbits may support recruitment. Furthermore, abundance   stability of adult eagle owls was positively related to previous   winter-spring rabbit density, which could suggest predator population   stabilisation through quick territory occupation in high-quality areas.   These results exemplify the trade-off between prey availability and   abundance of adult predators related to population growth and abundance   stability in the eagle owl-rabbit system in south-western Europe.   Despite rabbits have greatly declined during the last decades and eagle   owls locally specialise on them, eagle owls currently have a favourable   conservation status. As eagle owls are the only nocturnal raptor with   such dependence on rabbits, this could point out that predators may   overcome prey decreases in areas with favourable climate and prey in the   absence of superior competitors with similar foraging mode.

The main topics are presented within the   standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles:   distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral   and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation.   2 Melampyrum sylvaticum is a hemiparasitic annual of upland, often   birch-dominated woodlands. It is found across boreal and montane areas   of Europe but within the UK it is predominantly found in the Scottish   Highlands. These populations are consequently very isolated and   vulnerable to a range of threats. Suitable habitat is characterized by   open-canopied deciduous woodland close to water bodies, such as   fast-flowing burns or lochs. Sites are typically north-facing, in cool   and wet areas of Britain, on moderately acidic soils that are moist but   freely draining.   3 Hemiparasitism allows M. sylvaticum to acquire nutrients from a range   of hosts but very little is known about which species it is able to   parasitize in the field. Melampyrum sylvaticum is associated with   herb-rich patches of the understorey.   4 Melampyrum sylvaticum is insect-pollinated. Ants have been reported to   be the main dispersal agents and the seed bears an elaiosome which   offers them a lipid-rich reward. However, neither insect pollination nor   ant dispersal has been observed directly in British populations.   5 Melampyrum sylvaticum has relatively large seeds and been described as   an `annual K-strategist'; it has been suggested that this unusual   combination makes it vulnerable to environmental change. Because of its   endangered status, M. sylvaticum has been classed as a UK Biodiversity   Action Plan species and a recovery project is underway to protect   existing populations and to introduce it to suitable habitats in the   Central Highlands of Scotland.",727,NO,SH,,,

The role of mires in the global carbon cycle, and the   delivery of different ecosystem services can be considerably altered by   changes in the vegetation, which has a strong impact on peat-formation   and hydrology. Mire ecosystems are commonly open with limited canopy   cover but both nitrogen deposition and increased temperatures may   increase the woody vegetation component. It has been predicted that such   an increase in tree cover and the associated effects on light and water   regimes would cause a positive feed-back loop with respect to the ground   vegetation. None of these effects, however, have so far been confirmed   in large-scale spatiotemporal studies. Here we analyzed data pertaining   to mire vegetation from the Swedish National Forest Inventory collected   from permanent sample plots over a period of 20 yr along a latitudinal   gradient covering 14 degrees. We hypothesized that the changes would be   larger in the southern parts as a result of higher nitrogen deposition   and warmer climate. Our results showed an increase in woody vegetation   with increases in most ericaceous dwarf-shrubs and in the basal area of   trees. These changes were, in contrast to our expectations, evenly   distributed over most of the latitudinal gradient. While nitrogen   deposition is elevated in the south, the increase in temperatures during   recent decades has been larger in the north. Hence, we suggest that   different processes in the north and south have produced similar   vegetation changes along the latitudinal gradient. There was, however, a   sharp increase in compositional change at high deposition, indicating a   threshold effect in the response. Instead of a positive feed-back loop   caused by the tree layer, an increase in canopy cover reduced the   changes in composition of the ground vegetation, whereas a decrease in   canopy cover lead to larger changes. Increased natural disturbances of   the tree layer due to, for example, pathogens or climate is a predicted   outcome of climate change. Hence, these results may have important   implications for predictions of long-term effects of increased   temperature on peatland vegetation.",733,NO,SH,,,

In this work, we performed bioinformatics, biochemical, and plant growth   analyses to identify nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) proteins of   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are involved in CDP synthesis. A reverse   genetics strategy allowed the identification of the genes encoding   putative multi-modular-NRPS (MM-NRPS).

The results showed that two types of   natural enemies of the dominant dwarf-shrub Vaccinium myrtillus   (pathogenic fungus of the species Valdensia heterodoxa and herbivorous   larvae of the genus Operophtera) influenced the vegetation dynamics. The   pathogenic fungus, causing premature leaf-shed of V. myrtillus, showed a   strong positive N response during the initial 5-year period. For the   larvae, a relatively modest N response was overshadowed by an almost   40-fold population increase during an outbreak event that followed the   initial 5-year period. This outbreak occurred irrespective of N   addition, resulting in V. myrtillus decline and depriving the pathogenic   fungus of its substrate. Hence our study demonstrates that vegetation   dynamics in this relatively species poor and seemingly simple ecosystem   are driven by complex biotic interactions. Further, we show that an   important component of these interactions is the temporal alternation of   the two natural enemies and, resultant regulation of the dominant   plant's abundance. Finally, we emphasize that long-term data are   essential to capture the complexity of this type of biotic interactions.

The influence of prokaryote physiology and   environmental factors on viral replication cycles (lytic and lysogeny)   was investigated from April to September 2011 at three different strata   (epi, meta, and hypolimnion) in the mixolimnion of deep volcanic   temperate freshwater Lake Pavin (France). Overall, the euphotic region   (epi and metalimnion) was more dynamic and showed significant variation   in microbial standing stocks, prokaryotic physiological state, and viral   life strategies compared to the aphotic hypolimnion which was stable   within sampled months. The prokaryotic host physiology as inferred from   the nucleic acid content of prokaryotic cells (high or low nucleic acid)   was strongly regulated by the chlorophyll concentration. The   predominance of the high nucleic acid (HNA) prokaryotes (cells) over low   nucleic acid (LNA) prokaryotes (cells) in the spring (HNA/LNA = 1.2) and   vice versa in the summer period (HNA/LNA = 0.4) suggest that the natural   prokaryotic communities underwent major shifts in their physiological   states during investigated time period. The increase in the percentage   of inducible lysogenic prokaryotes in the summer period was associated   with the switch in the dominance of LNA over HNA cells, which coincided   with the periods of strong resource (nutrient) limitation. This supports   the idea that lysogeny represents a maintenance strategy for viruses in   unproductive or harsh nutrient/host conditions. A negative correlation   of percentage of lysogenic prokaryotes with HNA cell abundance and   chlorophyll suggest that lysogenic cycle is closely related to   prokaryotic cells which are stressed or starved due to unavailability of   resources for its growth and activity. Our results provide support to   previous findings that changes in prokaryote physiology are critical for   the promotion and establishment of lysogeny in aquatic ecosystems, which   are prone to constant environmental fluctuations.",736,MAYBE,SH,yes,,

The waste of olive used to produce compost could be of safe disposal   technique. Disposal of such waste is expensive and it causes some   environmental hazards. Rock phosphate (RP), which is available in the   same region, can be used to improve the nutrient value of the produced   compost. In this experiment olive pruning waste was composted alone and   in a mixture with different RP in two different ratios, namely 5\% and   10\%, on the dry weight basis of olive waste. Compost processing took   place on plies for 8months. Temperature and moisture were monitored   daily while periodical samples were taken from all piles for testing pH,   EC, C/N, and germination index.

Questions: (1) How does a mosquito allocate her time and energy to blood   and sugar feeding? (2) How does the availability of sugar and/or blood   influence her decisions?   Methods and key assumptions: We use a dynamic state variable model to   address this question. The model is parameterized from primary   literature using Anopheles gambiae for reference where possible. The   model assumes that female mosquitoes have evolved to make decisions that   maximize their lifetime reproductive success.   Conclusions: Blood and sugar have important roles in the life history of   blood-feeding female mosquitoes. In the presence of blood hosts, the   decision to search for a blood meal is almost always chosen over the   search for sugar. However, away from the blood host microhabitat, sugar   is readily used. Survivorship and fecundity are increased with an   increase in sugar availability. Frequency of blood feeding, mosquito   fecundity, and survivorship are only marginally decreased with decreases   in blood availability.",738,NO,SH,,,

Because both mussel and salmonid populations are often threatened, this   study not only adds knowledge to the understanding of host-parasite   systems, but it is also of conservation value. Individual trout,   mussel-encysted (25.1 +/- 5.7 larvae center dot g(-1) body weight, n =   5) or non-encysted (n = 5), were fed with chironomid larvae in a   flow-through stream aquarium. Feeding trials were filmed and analyzed by   counting the numbers of chironomid larvae each individual ate, and by   estimating the prey-capture distance. Non-encysted trout had a   significantly higher drift-foraging rate than did encysted trout, and   they captured significantly more prey further away from their focal   point. The reduced foraging success of encysted trout was mainly due to   their failure to catch prey relatively further from their focal point.   This suggests that reduced foraging success of encysted trout may be due   to poorer energetic status, but the physical effects of mussel larvae on   prey handling time cannot be ruled out. Encysted trout caught   approximately 20 \% fewer prey, which would result in a reduction in   growth potential during the period of mussel encystment.

Herbivore overbrowsing can have profound effects on ecosystem processes   through overconsumption or by altering organic inputs of leaves and   roots as well as changing soil physical and chemical properties. We   evaluated the fate of transplanted seedlings of four tropical tree   species and nutrient availability in open control plots and enclosed   plots that permitted free access by insects and excluded vertebrates and   collected soil samples in old-fields, early secondary forests and   old-growth forests. Seedling damage predominantly occurred in the dry   season and produced an overall seedling mortality of 72\%, with values   of 43\% and 86\% in the plots that prohibited and permitted vertebrate   access, respectively. Except for Myrsine coriacea in the old-fields and   Syagrus romanzoffiana in the early secondary forest, seedlings suffered   greater rates of damage and mortality in the open plots, showing that   the aboveground large herbivores, such as capybaras (Hydrochoerus   hydrochaeris), might prevent or at least delay plant recruitment in   tropical areas supporting elevated densities. However, delayed deaths   from disease by soil fertility-related factors were observed in late   summer in the old-field seedlings, suggesting that previous activities   in these areas had led to profound changes in the soil properties.   Herbivores may have important consequences for tropical forest   regeneration, as overconsumption may slow down nutrient cycling, promote   cascading bottom-up effects on consumers, and ultimately lead to   ecological meltdown.

While   the effects of ecotype origin on the performance of translocated plants   are increasingly acknowledged among researchers and practitioners,   ecotype effects on associated communities and ecosystems have hardly   been studied. This is critical because plants also constitute the   habitat for a large number of interacting organisms, and many of them   might he influenced by plant ecotype characteristics. Here, we studied   different ecotypes of Centaurea jacea L, a plant species commonly used   in grassland restoration, and their effects on seed herbivores and their   parasiloids. We grew eight C. jacea ecotypes originating from different   regions in Germany in a common garden and found that the ecotypes   differed up to three-fold in the frequencies of seed herbivores. These   differences appeared to be mainly driven by ecotype differences in   flowering phenology. We also found that there were up to four-fold   differences in the frequencies of parasitoids, and even up to nine-fold   differences in the abundances of parasitoids among ecotypes. In summary,   plants from different origins substantially differed in their effects on   interacting organisms, potentially reflecting coevolutionary   relationships across trophic levels.

Quantitative food webs from 10 replicate pairs of organic and   conventional farms showed that organic farms have significantly more   species at three trophic levels (plant, herbivore and parasitoid) and   significantly different network structure. Herbivores on organic farms   were attacked by more parasitoid species on organic farms than on   conventional farms. However, differences in network structure did not   translate into differences in robustness to simulated species loss and   we found no difference in percentage parasitism (natural pest control)   across a variety of host species. Furthermore, a manipulative field   experiment demonstrated that the higher species richness of parasitoids   on the organic farms did not increase mortality of a novel herbivore   used to bioassay ecosystem service.

We provide the first   documentation of a shift in abundance between arbuscular mycorrhizae and   ectomycorrhizae during floodplain succession. We used a chronosequence   spanning 0-70 yr along a river in northwestern Montana, USA, to test the   hypothesis that abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is   greatest in early stages of soil development, and abundance of   ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF) is greatest later in floodplain succession.   We also measured the AMF-mediated process of formation of soil   aggregates during site development. AMF colonization of the dominant   tree (black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa) remained low (< 5\%), while   AMF colonization of understory species was high (45-90\%), across the   chronosequence. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) and hyphal length   of AMF in soil peaked within the first 13 yr of succession and then   declined. No single variable significantly correlated with AMF   abundance, but AMF tended to decline as litter and soil organic matter   increased. Density of ectomycorrhizal root tips in soil increased   linearly throughout the chronosequence, and ectomycorrhizal colonization   of cottonwood roots increased rapidly in early stages of succession.   These patterns suggest that ECMF are not limited by dispersal, but   rather influenced by abundance of host plants. Formation of water stable   aggregates increased rapidly during the first third of the   chronosequence, which was the period of greatest AMF abundance in the   soil. The peak in AMF infectivity and hyphal length during early   succession suggests that regular flooding and establishment of new sites   promotes AMF abundance in this ecosystem. Regulation of rivers that   eliminates creation of new sites may reduce contributions of AMF to   riparian areas.",744,NO,SH,,,

In this   context, synergistic effects between predation risk and other natural   stressors on prey organisms are gaining attention. Although   non-pathogenic bacteria can be widespread in aquatic ecosystems, their   role in mediating effects of predation risk has been ignored. We here   address the hypothesis that non-pathogenic bacteria may reinforce the   negative effects of predation risk in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion   puella. We found synergistic effects for all three life history   variables studied: mortality increased, growth reductions were magnified   and bacterial load was higher when both non-lethal stressors were   combined. The combined exposure to the bacterium and predation risk   considerably impaired the two key antipredator mechanisms of the   damselfly larvae: they no longer reduced their food intake under   predation risk and showed a synergistic reduction in escape swimming   speed. The reinforcing negative effects on the fitness-related traits   could be explained by the observed synergistic effects on food intake,   swimming muscle mass, immune function and oxidative damage. These are   likely widespread consequences of energetic constraints and increased   metabolic rates associated with the fight-or-flight response. We   therefore hypothesize that the here documented synergistic interactions   with non-pathogenic bacteria may be widespread. Our results highlight   the ignored ecological role of non-pathogenic bacteria in reinforcing   the negative effects of predation risk on prey organisms.",745,NO,SH,,,

On islands off the coast of   New Zealand, seabird-dominated islands support greater densities of   soil- and litter-dwelling consumer biota. We predicted that islands with   high seabird densities would have higher levels of leaf damage as a   result of higher densities of foliar consumers (herbivores and   pathogens). Damage levels on leaves of six common tree species were   compared between 9 islands with active seabird colonies and 10 islands   with low seabird densities resulting from invasion by predatory rats.   There were no consistent differences in leaf damage by chewing, mining,   or phloem-feeding herbivores across plant species; pathogen damage was   lower on islands with high seabird densities than on those with low   densities, but this was driven by only two of the plant species.   Instead, plant species differed in which of several possible damage   types responded to seabird presence, and in which plant leaf traits   responded to seabird-related environmental changes. Across plant   species, those with more resource-acquisitive leaf traits such as high   percent nitrogen and low structural investment experienced higher levels   of chewing damage (which accounted for 66-100\% of all damage), but not   other damage types.

We found that the presence of algae reduced survivorship   and settlement success of planulae. With the addition of the   broad-spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin, these negative effects were   reversed, suggesting that algae indirectly cause planular mortality by   enhancing microbial concentrations or by weakening the coral's   resistance to microbial infections. Algae further reduced recruitment   success of corals as planulae preferentially settled on algal surfaces,   but later suffered 100\% mortality. In contrast to survival, settlement   was unsuccessful in treatments containing antibiotics, suggesting that   benthic microbes may be necessary to induce settlement.

Without understanding the response of   plague systems to anthropogenic or climate changes in their trophic web,   it is unfeasible to effectively predict years with high risks of plague   outbreak, hampering our ability for effective prevention and control of   the disease. Here, by using surveillance data, we apply structural   equation modelling to reveal the drivers of plague prevalence in two   very different rodent systems: those of the solitary Daurian ground   squirrel and the social Mongolian gerbil. We show that plague prevalence   in the Daurian ground squirrel is not detectably related to its trophic   web, and that therefore surveillance efforts should focus on detecting   plague directly in this ecosystem. On the other hand, plague in the   Mongolian gerbil is strongly embedded in a complex, yet understandable   trophic web of climate, vegetation, and rodent and flea densities,   making the ecosystem suitable for more sophisticated low-cost   surveillance practices, such as remote sensing. As for the trophic webs   of the two rodent species, we find that increased vegetation is   positively associated with higher temperatures and precipitation for   both ecosystems. We furthermore find a positive association between   vegetation and ground squirrel density, yet a negative association   between vegetation and gerbil density. Our study thus shows how past   surveillance records can be used to design and improve existing plague   prevention and control measures, by tailoring them to individual plague   foci.

Linear mixed effect models and partial Mantel tests were used to   elucidate the extent to which congruence in genus richness and   composition was driven by environmental factors. Congruence not   explained by environmental controls might indicate ecological   interactions across trophic levels of lake plankton. Genus richness and   composition of phyto- and zooplankton were significantly congruent.   Environmental factors had limited power to explain the genus richness of   phyto- and zooplankton (R-2: 6\% and 12\%, respectively). Including   richness of the reciprocal group among the predictors markedly improved   each respective model and explanatory power (R-2: 11\% and 17\%,   respectively). Similarly, a large proportion of the congruence in genus   composition was independent of environmental dissimilarity (Mantel r:   0.29 and partial Mantel r after accounting for environmental control:   0.17). The strength of the congruence varied among different groups of   phyto- and zooplankton, likely reflecting that the different zooplankton   groups differ in their grazing size spectra and thus in the strength of   their coupling with the phytoplankton assemblages. Remarkably,   congruence with phytoplankton was strongest for the smallest group of   zooplankton, rotifers, which graze on a limited size spectrum of   phytoplankton. Moreover, congruence was stronger in low-nutrient lakes,   suggesting that the strength of the interactions between the two groups   weakens with eutrophication. This is likely due to changes in trophic   dynamics, where enhanced fish predation on large-bodied zooplankton with   increasing nutrient levels results in reduced zooplankton grazing   control of phytoplankton assemblages.",750,NO,SH,,,

Studies on the robustness of ecological communities suggest that the   loss or reduction in abundance of individual species can lead to   secondary and cascading extinctions. However, most such studies have   been simulation-based analyses of the effect of primary extinction on   food web structure.   2. In a field experiment we tested the direct and indirect effects of   reducing the abundance of a common species, focusing on the diverse and   self-contained assemblage of arthropods associated with an abundant   Brazilian shrub, Baccharis dracunculifolia D.C. (Asteraceae).   3. Over a 5-month period we experimentally reduced the abundance of   Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae (Sternorrhyncha: Psyllidae), the   commonest galling species associated with B. dracunculifolia, in 15   replicate plots paired with 15 control plots. We investigated direct   effects of the manipulation on parasitoids attacking B.   dracunculifoliae, as well as indirect effects (mediated via a third   species or through the environment) on 10 other galler species and 50   associated parasitoid species.   4. The experimental manipulation significantly increased parasitism on   B. dracunculifoliae in the treatment plots, but did not significantly   alter either the species richness or abundance of other galler species.   Compared to control plots, food webs in manipulated plots had   significantly lower values of weighted connectance, interaction evenness   and robustness (measured as simulated tolerance to secondary   extinction), even when B. dracunculifoliae was excluded from   calculations.   5. Parasitoid species were almost entirely specialized to individual   galler species, so the observed effects of the manipulation on food web   structure could not have propagated via the documented trophic links.   Instead, they must have spread either through trophic links not included   in the webs (e.g. shared predators) or non-trophically (e.g. through   changes in habitat availability). Our results highlight that the   inclusion of both trophic and non-trophic direct and indirect   interactions is essential to understand the structure and dynamics of   even apparently discrete ecological communities.",752,NO,SH,,,

Although a high diversity of viral types   has been characterized from corals over the last decade, we are only   beginning to understand the distribution, dynamics, and roles of viral   consortia in reef ecosystems. This review synthesizes previous work on   the viruses associated with corals and their cnidarian relatives, and   highlights some strengths and limitations of the methods commonly used   for viral analysis. Based on these foundational studies, we present a   current working model for stony coral virology. We hypothesize that   viruses are present on and within corals and that these consortia   commonly include representatives of the Herpesviridae, Phycodnaviridae,   and phages and archaeal viruses. Our working model posits that these   different viral groups target distinct hosts, specifically the coral   itself, its endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodinium spp.), and its resident   microbiome, respectively. Corals may also harbor additional viral   diversity (e.g., members of the Iridoviridae) that is pathogenic to   reef-associated organisms. Viral infections likely underlie some coral   diseases and may be responsible for reef epizootics, but evidence for   viral-mediated coral disease is currently inconclusive. Future efforts   in coral viral ecology should focus on determining if and how viral   infection contributes to reduced coral fitness and/or benthic community   shifts in reef ecosystems.

Yet, there is a concerning global trend of   pollinator declines. Parasites and pesticides are among the suspected   principle drivers of these declines. However, especially in the case of   key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact   of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to   increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we   investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides,   thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9-week period and a prevalent   trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony   traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary   exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of   thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field   truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased   overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a   significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite   infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is   intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of   parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was   lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined   exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be   exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced   parasite virulence is expected.Synthesis and applications. Our findings   reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on   bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined   negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional   adverse consequences for long-term population dynamics under complex   field conditions. To help safeguard pollinator health, whole life-cycle   fitness assessments, particularly for non-Apis bees, stringently   incorporating chronic and sublethal side effects of pesticides, as well   as interactions with common natural stressors, such as prevalent   parasites, should be considered in the corresponding test guidelines.

As concentrated hubs of human-mediated movement, the urban   landscape is, however, often the first point of contact for exotic pests   including insects and plant pathogens. Consequently, urban trees can be   important for accidentally introduced forest pests to become established   and potentially invasive. Reductions in biodiversity and the potential   for stressful conditions arising from anthropogenic disturbances can   predispose these trees to pest attack, further increasing the likelihood   of exotic forest pests becoming established and increasing in density.   Once established in urban environments, dispersal of introduced pests   can proceed to natural forest landscapes or planted forests. In addition   to permanent long-term damage to natural ecosystems, the consequences of   these invasions include costly attempts at eradication and post   establishment management strategies. We discuss a range of ecological,   economic and social impacts arising from these incursions and the   importance of global biosecurity is highlighted as a crucially important   barrier to pest invasions. Finally, we suggest that urban trees may be   viewed as `sentinel plantings'. In particular, botanical gardens and   arboreta frequently house large collections of exotic plantings,   providing a unique opportunity to help predict and prevent the invasion   of new pests, and where introduced pests with the capacity to cause   serious impacts in forest environments could potentially be detected   during the initial stages of establishment.

Almost all research in this area has focused on host species   diversity and has neglected parasite diversity, despite evidence that   parasites are important drivers of community structure and ecosystem   processes. Here, we assessed whether presence or abundance of each of   nine helminth species parasitizing lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens)   was associated with indices of parasite diversity (i.e. species richness   and Shannon's Diversity Index). We found repeated instances of focal   parasite presence and abundance having significant positive co-variation   with diversity measures of other parasites. These results occurred both   within individual samples and for combinations of all samples. Whereas   host condition and parasite facilitation could be drivers of the   patterns we observed, other host-or parasite-level effects, such as age   or sex class of host or taxon of parasite, were discounted as   explanatory variables. Our findings of recurring and positive   associations between focal parasite abundance and diversity underscore   the importance of moving beyond pairwise species interactions and   contexts, and of including the oft-neglected parasite species diversity   in infection-diversity studies.

At Seal Rocks (northern Bass Strait), home to 25 \% of the   entire species population, we assessed diet through collections (1997 to   2006) of scat and regurgitate samples. We identified prey remains of 42   fish taxa and 7 cephalopod taxa. Only crustaceans that were fish   parasites or fish prey (amphipods and isopods) were found; no birds were   identified in the samples. Six species represented 80 \% (as frequency   of occurrence) of the fish prey, and the arrow squid Nototodarus gouldi   represented 70 \% of cephalopod prey. There was significant annual   variability in the diet. Principal component analysis indicated this was   variability due to the presence of redbait Emmelichthys nitidus in some   years, and its near absence and replacement in other years by increased   proportions of barracouta Thyrsites atun, red cod Pseudophycis bachus   and leatherjackets (Family Triglidae). Generalised Linear Models   indicated the annual variation was related to mean sea surface   temperatures in western Bass Strait where the seals foraged. Redbait   proliferated in cooler years and were less abundant in warmer years. No   corresponding annual correlation was evident between the prey   assemblages and either annual fisheries catch-per-unit-effort or the   annual mean Southern Oscillation Index.

In a comprehensive observational study of free-living and   reproductively active Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), we examined the   possible modulating effects of male social status (including ornamental   development), parasite intensities, and immunity on novel traits   indicative of ejaculate quality (e. g., Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in   sperm cells, levels of immunoglobulins attached to sperm cells, and the   degree of DNA fragmentation in sperm cells). A multiple regression model   showed no relationship between DNA fragmentation in sperm cells and   abdominal coloration of charr, suggesting that sperm of colorful males   are not better protected against oxidative stress. We found, however,   that males with traits indicative of high social status had low amounts   of ATP in sperm cells and also sperm cells with low swimming speed.   Sperm production, on the other hand, was strongly predicted by parasite   intensities only and these associations were mainly positive. Our   results suggest that the presence of parasites seems to stimulate sperm   production similar to what is observed among males entering subordinate   reproductive roles. Thus, if resistance toward parasites is influencing   parasite intensities, resistance may also indirectly be important for   the ``choice'' of reproductive role and in turn investment in primary   sex traits.",760,NO,SH,,,

The highest percentage of ramets   colonized or dead with canker was found on Tanana River plots,   suggesting the epidemic is most severe in the Fairbanks region. A   positive relationship between \% basal area loss to canker and \% canopy   loss provides a simple means for assessing stand-level mortality   associated with disease in the field.

Variations in SNF and live nodule biomass translated to differences in   N-fixation inputs, which ranged from 22 to 107 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) across   study regions.

Species identity had the   greatest effect on mass loss and N dynamics with the most rapid rates in   bay laurel, slowest in redwood, and intermediate in tanoak. Decomposing   litter from infected sources had increased N accumulation, and although   these changes were of lower magnitude relative to species identity, the   region-scale invasion of P. ramorum suggests that this effect could   occur over an extensive area. Canopy mortality was a significant and   slowing influence on litter N dynamics in all species and also dampened   non-additive effects within mixed litter bags.

Recent evidence   suggests that increases in elk seroprevalence may be associated with   increasing elk densities and/or increasing size of elk aggregations.   However, the interactions between elk population density, landscape   factors, and elk aggregation patterns are not well-understood, making   appropriate management responses challenging. Using a unique, long-term   elk aggregation dataset collected across a wide range of elk population   sizes, we investigated relationships between elk population size,   landscape factors, and elk aggregation responses (group size and group   density) with goals of clarifying how changes in elk population size may   affect elk aggregation patterns. Overall, landscape attributes and   weather had a stronger influence on elk aggregation patterns than   factors such as elk population size that are within management control.   We found little evidence that elk population size affected mean elk   group sizes, but we did find evidence that the size and density of the   largest elk aggregations increased as elk population size increased. We   also found some evidence that group densities increased following the   establishment of wolves. However, across the relatively wide range of   elk population sizes observed in this study, only modest changes in elk   group density were observed, suggesting that dramatic reductions in   population sizes would be necessary to produce measureable reductions in   elk group density to affect frequency-dependent transmission. Management   actions designed to lower disease transmission are likely to negatively   affect other objectives related to elk management and conservation. We   therefore suggest that a first step in managing disease transmission   risk is agreement among stakeholders interested in elk management of all   objectives related to elk management, including acknowledgment that   disease transmission is undesirable.

Results were in accord with previous research on fresh leaves   showing that concentrations of many elements were higher in the   mistletoe than the host. This was not the case for all elements; most   notably for N, where concentrations were significantly lower in the   mistletoe. However, the return of all elements increased with mistletoe   infection because of the combined effect of enrichment in mistletoe   tissues and high rates of mistletoe litterfall. Annual returns of N and   P in leaf litter increased by a factor of 1.65 and 3 respectively, with   the greatest increase being for K by a factor of 43 in spring. These   increased element returns were not significantly influenced by any   changes in host leaf litter quality, as mistletoe infection was not   found to affect host element concentrations. Mistletoe infection also   altered the spatial and temporal distribution of element returns because   of the patchy occurrence of mistletoes and extended period of mistletoe   litterfall compared with the host. These findings provide a mechanistic   explanation for the role of mistletoes as a keystone resource and,   together with comparable results from root-parasitic plants in boreal   tundra and cool-temperate grasslands, suggest that enhancing nutrient   return rates may be a generalized property of parasitic plants.",766,YES,SH,yes,,

We assessed the structural resistance and resilience of the   microbiome using a high-throughput pyrosequencing approach in   differently compacted soils at two forest sites and correlated these   findings with changes in soil physical properties and functions.   Alterations in soil porosity after compaction strongly limited the air   and water conductivity. Compaction significantly reduced abundance,   increased diversity, and persistently altered the structure of the   microbiota. Fungi were less resistant and resilient than bacteria;   clayey soils were less resistant and resilient than sandy soils. The   strongest effects were observed in soils with unfavorable moisture   conditions, where air and water conductivities dropped well below 10\%   of their initial value. Maximum impact was observed around 6-12 months   after compaction, and microbial communities showed resilience in lightly   but not in severely compacted soils 4 years post disturbance. Bacteria   capable of anaerobic respiration, including sulfate, sulfur, and metal   reducers of the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, were significantly   associated with compacted soils.

Fresh produce such as berry fruit and leafy vegetables are   excellent vehicles for transmission of HAV, as they are often eaten raw   or after minimal processing. Several outbreaks of hepatitis transmitted   by consumption of contaminated fruit or vegetables have been described.   HAV can contaminate foods via handling by infected persons, and fresh   produce can be contaminated during production through irrigation with   sewage-contaminated water. Efficient methods for detection of HAV on   fresh produce exist, and some studies have found HAV contamination of   fresh produce in the field or at retail, or contamination of waters used   in primary production. HAV is relatively resistant to chlorination, but   alternative disinfection procedures can be effective.

Modeling the effects of environmental   pressure on transposition activity in asexual populations*,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,145-151,145-151,10.1016/j.tpb.2013.07.004,"Transposable elements are DNA segments capable of persisting in host   genomes by self-replication in spite of deleterious mutagenic effects.   The theoretical dynamics of these elements within genomes has been   studied extensively, and population genetic models predict that they can   invade and maintain as a result of both intra-genomic and   inter-individual selection in sexual species. In asexuals, the success   of selfish DNA is more difficult to explain. However, most theoretical   work assumes constant environment. Here, we analyze the impact of   environmental change on the dynamics of transposition activity when   horizontal DNA exchange is absent, based on a stochastic computational   model of transposable element proliferation. We argue that repeated   changes in the phenotypic optimum in a multidimensional fitness   landscape may induce explosive bursts of transposition activity   associated with faster adaptation. However, long-term maintenance of   transposition activity is unlikely. This could contribute to the   significant variation in the transposable element copy number among   closely related species.

However, the transmission of pathogens   from wildlife to domestic animals has recently gained prominence,   including H5N1 avian influenza from wild ducks to poultry, bovine   tuberculosis from badgers to cattle, and brucellosis from elk and bison   to cattle. The risk of transmission of Brucella abortus (the causative   agent of brucellosis) from bison (Bison bison) to cattle around   Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is a hotly debated topic and an   important conservation issue.   Here we use a model to integrate epidemiological and ecological data to   assess the spatio-temporal relative risk of transmission of Brucella   from bison to cattle outside YNP under different scenarios.   Our risk assessment shows that relative risk is spatially and temporally   heterogeneous with local hotspots, shows a highly skewed distribution   with predominantly low risk, and is strongly dependent on climate and   the abundance of bison. We outline two strategies for managing this   risk, and highlight the consequences of the current adaptive management   plan.   Synthesis and applications. Our results provide a detailed quantitative   assessment of risk that offers several advantages over projections of   numbers of bison leaving Yellowstone National Park. They suggest that   risk could be effectively managed with lower costs, but that land use   issues and the larger question of bison population management and   movement outside the park might hinder the prospect of solutions that   will please all stakeholders.

In this study, an equilibrium monoethanolamine-based CO2 capture   plant and compression train model was developed, validated and then used   to assess the effects of KOPs on the performance of the CO2 capture and   compression process applied to a 400 MWe combined cycle gas turbine   (CCGT) power plant in hot countries using selected non -monetized key   economic and environmental performance indicators.

The results illustrate higher compression power   and dramatic increase of cooling water requirements in coolers and   washing water systems in hot countries. This work elucidates the complex   compromise between minimizing capital and operating expenditure   indicators, and environmental impacts.

Only one population was persistent throughout   all years studied; most likely this population supplied the surrounding   landscape with 11 smaller, temporary local populations. Despite stable   pollen availability, the size of the persistent population fluctuated   dramatically in a two-year cycle over the nine years, with 490-1230   nests in odd-numbered years and 21-48 nests in even-numbered years.   These fluctuations were not significantly related to climatic variables   or pollen availability. Nineteen colonization and 14 extinction events   were recorded.

There were significant positive correlations between the size of the   persistent population and patch occupancy and colonization.   Colonizations were generally more common in patches closer to the   persistent population, whereas extinctions were independent of distance   from the persistent population.

In this study, we describe prey   availability and assess the trophic coupling between eiders and their   macrobenthic prey in a shallow inlet, Nipisat Sound; a key wintering   habitat in the south-west Greenland Open Water Area. Macrobenthic   species abundance and biomass were studied, and annual production was   estimated by an empirical model, including environmental   characteristics, fauna composition and individual biomass. In spring   2008, average macrozoobenthic abundance and biomass were 6,912 ind m(-2)   and 28.4 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m(-2) (647 kJ m(-2)), respectively.

The parasitic sea lamprey contributed to the   devastating collapse of native fish communities after invading the Great   Lakes during the 1800s and early 1900s. Economic tragedy ensued with the   loss of the fishery and severe impacts to property values and tourism   resulting from sea lamprey-induced ecological changes. To control the   sea lamprey and rehabilitate the once vibrant Great Lakes ecosystem and   economy, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (Commission) was formed by   treaty between Canada and the United States in 1955. The Commission has   developed a sea lamprey control programme based on their physiological   vulnerabilities, which includes (i) the application of selective   pesticides (lampricides), which successfully kill sedentary sea lamprey   larvae in their natal streams; (ii) barriers to spawning migrations and   associated traps to prevent infestations of upstream habitats and remove   adult sea lamprey before they reproduce; and (iii) the release of   sterilized males to reduce the reproductive potential of spawning   populations in select streams. Since 1958, the application of the sea   lamprey control programme has suppressed sea lamprey populations by   similar to 90\% from peak abundance. Great Lakes fish populations have   rebounded and the economy is now thriving. In hopes of further enhancing   the efficacy and selectivity of the sea lamprey control programme, the   Commission is exploring the use of (i) sea lamprey chemosensory cues   (pheromones and alarm cues) to manipulate behaviours and physiologies,   and (ii) genetics to identify and manipulate genes associated with key   physiological functions, for control purposes.

Estimating and managing these at a convenient scale requires information   upscaling from the soil sample to the landscape level. We explore the   feasibility of predicting nematode MFs from temperature-based   bioclimatic parameters across a landscape. We assume that temperature   effects are reflected in MFs, since temperature variations determine   life processes ranging from enzyme activities to community structure. We   use microclimate data recorded for 1 year from sites differing by   orientation, altitude and vegetation cover. At the same sites we   estimate MFs for each nematode trophic group. Our models show that   bioclimatic parameters, specifically those accounting for temporal   variations in temperature and extremities, predict most of the variation   in nematode MFs. Higher fungivorous and lower bacterivorous nematode MFs   are predicted for sites with high seasonality and low isothermality   (sites of low vegetation, mostly at low altitudes), indicating   differences in the relative contribution of the corresponding food web   channels to the metabolism of carbon across the landscape. Higher   plant-parasitic MFs were predicted for sites with high seasonality. The   fitted models provide realistic predictions of unknown cases within the   range of the predictor's values, allowing for the interpolation of MFs   within the sampled region. We conclude that upscaling of the   bioindication potential of nematode communities is feasible and can   provide new perspectives not only in the field of soil ecology but other   research areas as well.",778,NO,SH,,,

Thermal   disturbances that elicit coral bleaching have been identified as a major   driver of such coral degradation. It has been suggested that either the   evolution of more tolerant symbionts, or shifts in the distribution of   existing, tolerant symbionts could ameliorate the effect of rising sea   temperatures on Caribbean reefs. Using a spatial ecosystem model we   describe the characteristics that new tolerant symbionts,   `super-symbionts', and their coral hosts, require for coral cover to be   maintained. We also quantify the time necessary for such symbionts to   become dominant before their potential beneficial effect is lost.   Running scenarios under two levels of greenhouse gas emissions, we find   that aggressive action to reduce emissions could almost triple the time   available for new super-symbionts to become dominant and potentially   mitigate the effect of thermal disturbances. The benefits of thermally   tolerant super-symbionts depend on the life-history traits of the host,   the number of coral species infected and the present coral assemblage.   Corals that are strong competitors with macroalgae are likely to become   dominant on future reefs if a super-symbiont appears in the next 25-60   years. In principle, super-symbionts could have ecosystem-level benefits   in the Caribbean providing that they become dominant in multiple coral   hosts with specific life-history traits within the next 60 years. This   potential benefit would only be realized if the appearance of the   super-symbiont is combined with drastic reductions of greenhouse gas   emissions and maintenance of ecosystem processes such as herbivory.",780,NO,SH,,,

To determine how N. coenophialum affects tall fescue, grassland   microcosms containing 16 transplants of two, four, or eight resident   species were seeded with endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-)   Kentucky-31 (KY-31) tall fescue.

We examined how sea lice   infestation affects predation risk and mortality of juvenile pink   (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon, and developed a   mathematical model to assess the implications for population dynamics   and conservation. A risk-taking experiment indicated that infected   juvenile pink salmon accept a higher predation risk in order to obtain   foraging opportunities. In a schooling experiment with juvenile chum   salmon, infected individuals had increased nearest-neighbor distances   and occupied peripheral positions in the school. Prey selection   experiments with cutthroat trout (O. clarkii) predators indicated that   infection reduces the ability of juvenile pink salmon to evade a   predatory strike. Group predation experiments with coho salmon (O.   kisutch) feeding on juvenile pink or chum salmon indicated that   predators selectively consume infected prey. The experimental results   indicate that lice may increase the rate of prey capture but not the   handling time of a predator. Based on this result, we developed a   mathematical model of sea lice and salmon population dynamics in which   parasitism affects the attack rate in a type II functional response.   Analysis of the model indicates that: (1) the estimated mortality of   wild juvenile salmon due to sea lice infestation is probably higher than   previously thought; (2) predation can cause a simultaneous decline in   sea louse abundance on wild fish and salmon productivity that could   mislead managers and regulators; and (3) compensatory mortality occurs   in the saturation region of the type II functional response where prey   are abundant because predators increase mortality of parasites but not   overall predation rates.

Diatom viruses in the water   column rapidly increased during C. debilis and C. tenuissimus blooms,   maintaining a high abundance throughout the blooming period. These data   suggest the potential importance of viruses in controlling the   population dynamics of diatoms in natural environments. The number of   viruses in sediments fluctuated considerably, even during non-blooming   periods, which suggests that virus-infected diatom cells were supplied   to the sediments from water-column populations throughout the year. This   process might be an important strategy to reduce the impact of viruses   on diatom populations. Because diatom populations are thought to have an   intimate relationship with their viruses in natural waters, further   studies of diatom dynamics should include the effects of viral   infections.",786,YES,SH,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

The consequences of climate change may be best predicted by   understanding its interaction with the cumulative effects of other   stressors, although this approach is rarely adopted. However, whether   this interaction is additive or interactive can hardly be predicted from   studies examining a single factor at a time. In particular, biotic   interactions are known to induce modifications in the functional role of   many species. Here, we explored the effect of temperature on leaf   consumption by a keystone freshwater shredder, the amphipod Gammarus   fossarum. This species is found at high densities in the wild and relies   on aggregation as an antipredator behavior. In addition, gammarids   regularly harbor acanthocephalan parasites that are known to induce   multiple effects on their hosts, including modifications on their   functional role. We thus assessed the cumulative effect of both   intraspecific interactions and parasitism. Consumption tests were   conducted on gammarids, either naturally infected with Pomphorhynchus   tereticollis or uninfected, feeding alone or in groups. Our results show   that increased temperatures induced a significant increase in   consumption, but only to a certain extent. Interestingly, consumption at   the highest temperature depended on amphipod density: Whereas a decrease   was observed for single individuals, no such effect on feeding was   observed for individuals in groups. In addition, infection by   acanthocephalan parasites per se significantly negatively impacted the   shredding role of gammarids. Overall, the combined effects of parasitism   and temperature appeared to be additive. Thus, future studies focusing   on the impact of climate change on the functional role of keystone   species may benefit from a multimodal approach under realistic   conditions to derive accurate predictions.",788,YES,SH,yes,,

The groups targeted   in this study are found in all lakes; however, both the abundance and   structure of small eukaryotes are dependent on the system's productivity   and depth. These data highlighted the presence of Chlorophyta   contributing on an average to 19.3\%, 14.7\% and 41.2\% of total small   eukaryotes in lakes Bourget, Aydat and Pavin, respectively. This study   also revealed the unexpected importance of Haptophyta, reaching 62.8\%   of eukaryotes in the euphotic zone of Lake Bourget. The high proportions   of these pigmented cells highlight the underestimation of these groups   by PCR-based methods. The presence of pigmented Chlorophyta in the   deepest zones of the lakes suggests a mixotrophic behaviour of these   taxa.

Dominant scavengers can impose a selection pressure that alters the   predator's fitness, morphology, behavior, and ecology. Interactions   between ursids, likely the most important dominant scavengers in the   Holarctic region, and solitary felids, which are characterized by long   feeding times, provide a good opportunity for studying the effects of   kleptoparasitism by dominant scavengers. We analyzed the effects of   scavenging by brown bears Ursus arctos on Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and   predator's response to kleptoparasitism in a European temperate forest   ecosystem. Bears found 32 \% of lynx prey remains and 15 \% of all   biomass of large prey killed by lynx was lost to bears. In response,   lynx increased their kill rate by 23 \% but were able to compensate for   only 59 \% of the losses. The frequency of bear scavenging was strongly   dependent on bear activity patterns and was highest during the lynx   pregnancy and lactation period, when up to half of lynx kills were   usurped by bears. We suggest that ursid scavenging, by promoting the   hunting of smaller prey, may have played an important role in the   evolution of the Lynx genus as well as other predators in the Holarctic.   Our study indicates that prey loss to dominant scavengers is a   widespread phenomenon among felids worldwide, including forest habitats.   We highlight several implications of scavenging that could considerably   improve our understanding of the ecology of vertebrate communities and   the evolution of predators as well as benefit the future management and   conservation of endangered predators.",790,NO,SH,,,

Numerous studies have compared biodiversity in   soil receiving organic fertilizer to soil under other fertilizer regimes   (inorganic fertilizers, unfertilized), yet the data were not analyzed   systematically across studies. We evaluated fertilizer effects on soil   nematode communities with a meta-analysis of more than 229 data points   from 54 studies around the world that were published between 1996 and   2015. Data were from cropland and considered five fertilizer regimes.   These regimes include unfertilized soils and those receiving inorganic   fertilizers (2 regimes), as well as organic fertilizers (2 regimes).   Species richness and total nematode abundance increased with increasing   carbon (C) inputs from fertilizers, whereas greater nitrogen (N)   application rates from fertilizers significantly reduced the species   richness, Shannon's diversity (H'), maturity index (MI) and   omnivore-predator nematode abundance. This could indicate that high   fertilizer N inputs simplifies the nematode community structure and   functions. Species richness, omnivore-predator nematode abundance and   structural index (SI) increased with the organically-fertilized regime   and declined in inorganically-fertilized regimes, suggesting that   organic fertilizers can buffer stresses and sustain soil food web   functions. Furthermore, organic fertilizers differed in their impact on   soil nematodes, as those with C-rich crop residues supported larger   free-living nematode populations and greatly promoted H', SI and   enrichment index (EI), whereas N-rich animal manure was more effective   in controlling plant-feeding nematodes. Our review suggests that the   application of C-rich crop residues is the most effective practice to   enhance soil biodiversity in intensively managed agroecosystems,   highlighting the importance of regular applications of straw and other   C-rich residues to preserve the ecological resilience of cropland.

In the layer between 200 and 2000 m, viral abundance   decreased sharply with depth, and prokaryote abundance accounted for a   large fraction (60\%) of the variability in viral abundance. In   contrast, in the deeper layer (>2000 m), the depth-dependent decrease in   viral abundance was less evident, and the relationship between viral and   prokaryote abundances was weak. Viral abundances were high in the   Antarctic bottom water and tended to decrease along the paths of the   Circumpolar Deep Water and the Pacific Deep Water. Outstanding peaks of   virus-to-prokaryote abundance ratios (mean +/- SE: 46 +/- 1.2) were   found in the bottom waters (depth > 3500 m) of the subtropical regions,   where sinking particle fluxes are known to be generally low.

Therefore, the   identity and number of host plant species providing these resources is   likely to be critical for parasite and herbivore performance.   2. We tested the effect of single and multiple host species on the   biomass of the generalist parasitic plant Rhinanthus minor and the   abundance of its aphid (Aphis gossypii) herbivores.   3. Parasite biomass was proportional to the number of haustorial   connections to host roots and was determined by host species identity   rather than host functional group. Host species identity was also an   important influence on aphid population size, and parasites attached to   Lotus corniculatus experienced a considerable reduction in aphid   herbivory.   4. The effects on the parasite attaching to multiple hosts depended on   the combination of species present. However, host mixtures generally   benefitted aphids by diluting the negative effects of particular host   species.   5.

The change in suitability was associated with induced terpenoid   synthesis in whitefly-infested plants and repressed terpenoid synthesis   in virus-infected plants. Elevation of terpenoid levels via exogenous   stem applications reduced the performance of whiteflies. In contrast,   suppression of terpenoid synthesis via gene silencing improved whitefly   fitness. By integrating genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, this   study demonstrated that virus infection depleted the terpenoid-mediated   plant defence against whiteflies, thereby favouring vectorvirus   mutualism.

Invaded and   un-invaded areas also differed in the taxonomical structure of arthropod   assemblies but not in trophic guild proportions. However, the fact that   arthropods were smaller in A. donax soils, together with the absence of   particular taxa within each trophic guild or even an entire trophic   group (parasitoids), suggests that food-web alterations in invaded areas   cannot be discarded. Habitat features also differed between invaded and   un-invaded areas with the poorest herbaceous understory and the largest   leaf litter deposition and soil carbon stock observed in A. donax plots.   The type of vegetation in riparian areas followed by the total native   plant species richness were identified as major causal factors to   changes in the abundance, diversity and composition of macro-arthropods.   However, our analyses also showed that some alterations related to A.   donax invasion were inconsistent across rivers, suggesting that A. donax   effects may be context dependent.

Further, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that   ocean-warming events could increase the frequency of CFD outbreaks on   coral reefs, but that OA-induced lowering of pH may ameliorate outbreaks   by slowing lesion expansion rates on individual hosts. Lowered pH may   still reduce overall host survivorship, however, by reducing   calcification and facilitating fungal bio-erosion.

In   this study, we describe the responses of the soil fungal community to   free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) in a semiarid chaparral shrubland in   Southern California (dominated by Adenomstoma fasciculatum) using large   subunit rRNA gene sequencing. Community composition varied greatly over   the landscape and responses to FACE were subtle, involving a few   specific groups. Increased frequency of Sordariomycetes and   Leotiomycetes, the latter including the Helotiales, a group that   includes many dark septate endophytes known to associate positively with   roots, was observed in the FACE plots. Fungal diversity, both in terms   of richness and evenness, increased consistently in the FACE treatment,   and was relatively high compared to other studies that used similar   methods. Increases in diversity were observed across multiple   phylogenetic levels, from genus to class, and were distributed broadly   across fungal lineages. Diversity was also higher in samples collected   close to (5 cm) plants compared to samples in canopy gaps (30 cm away   from plants). Fungal biomass correlated well with soil organic matter   (SOM) content, but patterns of diversity were correlated with fine root   production rather than SOM. We conclude that the fungal community in   this ecosystem is tightly linked to plant fine root production, and that   future changes in the fungal community in response to elevated CO2 and   other climatic changes will be primarily driven by changes in plant   belowground allocation.

The CCC-ECL process cools power plant flue gas to   175 K, at which point solid CO2 particles desublimate as the flue gas   further cools to 154K. Desublimating flue gas cools in a staged column   in direct contact with a cryogenic liquid and produces a CO2-lean flue   gas that warms against the incoming flue gas before venting. The   CO2/contacting liquid slurry separates through a filter to produce a CO2   stream that warms to 233 K and partially flashes to provide a CO2-rich   product. The CO2-rich product (99.2\%) liquefies under pressure to form   a product for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or sequestration. All   contacting liquid streams cool and cycle back to the staged column. An   internal CF4 refrigeration cycle transfers heat from melting CO2 to   desublimating CO2 by cooling contact liquid. An external cooling loop of   natural gas or other refrigerant provides the additional heat duty to   operate the cryogenic process.

The analysis estimates a panel data of rice   farming in Japan using a time-varying transition probability Markov   switching model, capturing (i) the alternate regimes of agro-ecosystems,   (ii) the controlling factors affecting the regime shifts of   agro-ecosystems, and (iii) the nonmonotonic response of agricultural   production under alternate regimes. Results show that the effect of crop   diversity on agro-ecosystem productivity differs depending on its   regimes. Crop diversity increases productivity during normal periods, a   normal regime, while it decreases the productivity during periods   exposed to disturbances such as extreme weather events and disease and   insect damage, an adverse regime. Further, we find that crop diversity   enhances the agro-ecosystem resilience. Thus, it increases the   likelihood of the agro-ecosystem remaining in a normal regime and   staving off an adverse regime. The crop diversity loss has gradually   increased in agro-ecosystems without sufficient understanding about the   linkage between crop diversity and agro-ecosystem resilience. Our   findings suggest the possibility that the agro-ecosystem resilience   would be a key driver of sustainable agriculture under increasing   uncertainties. This study gives useful insights on this issue by   empirically demonstrating the effects of crop diversity on the   agroecosystem resilience. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Given the breadth of environmental   benefits oysters provide, as well as their commercial and cultural   importance, sustainable oyster production has become a priority in   several regions, including the Chesapeake Bay. Current strategies   include treating restored reefs as permanent sanctuaries, which provide   long-term environmental benefits yet removes them from the fishery, or   harvesting reefs on a rotational basis, which provides economic value   yet decreases environmental benefits. The long term dynamics of these   strategies is unknown. Oysters have a complex, biphasic life cycle   (i.e., sessile adult and motile larval stages) and their viability is   intimately tied to a suite of environmental factors including, but not   limited to, flow regime, total suspended solids, temperature, salinity,   and dissolved oxygen. In order to determine how different oyster   management strategies affect oyster dynamics, we developed a multi-model   approach that integrates a 2-D hydrodynamic model, a larval transport   model, and a spatially-explicit, agent-based population dynamics model   to simulate long term oyster dynamics. We applied our model to a ten   reef system in the Great Wicomico River in the Chesapeake Bay, and   simulated six different combinations of sanctuary and/or harvest   management scenarios over an 8-year period. We evaluated the   environmental and commercial benefits of each strategy. Our results   indicated that sanctuary reefs are beneficial, and that the spatial   position of sanctuary reefs strongly affected source-sink dynamics and   must be considered before implementing a harvest regime. Simulations   that did not consider the source/sink dynamics of the reefs yielded   larger numbers of oysters for harvest in the short-term, yet resulted in   a complete fishery collapse in the long term. Selective, rotational   harvest, resulted in lower annual yield, but the fishery persisted   throughout the eight year simulation. This integrated modeling approach   helped reduce uncertainty within the study system and can help natural   resource managers understand ecosystem-level processes leading to more   informed decision making across spatial and temporal scales.

We aimed to understand the inability of   specialists to spread on abandoned fields by exploring whether   performance of generalists and specialists depended on soil abiotic   and/or biotic legacy. We performed a greenhouse experiment with 12   species, six specialists and six generalists. The plants were grown in   sterile soil from dry grassland or abandoned field inoculated with   microbial communities from one or the other site. Plant growth,   abundance of mycorrhizal structures and plant response to inoculation   were evaluated. We focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), one of   the most important parts of soil communities affecting plant   performance. The abandoned field soil negatively affected plant growth,   but positively affected plant response to inoculation. The AMF community   from both sites differed in infectivity and taxa frequencies. The lower   AMF taxa frequency in the dry grassland soil suggested a lack of   functional complementarity. Despite the fact that dry grassland AMF   produced more arbuscules, the dry grassland inoculum did not improve   phosphorus nutrition of specialists contrary to the abandoned field   inoculum. Inoculum origin did not affect phosphorus nutrition of   generalists. The lower effectiveness of the dry grassland microbial   community toward plant performance excludes its inoculation in the   abandoned field soil as a solution to allow settlement of specialists.   Still, the distinct response of specialists and generalists to   inoculation suggested that they differ in AMF responsiveness.",805,NO,SH,,,

However, Allee effects   acting on parasites have rarely been considered in the analogous process   of infectious disease establishment and spread. We studied the   colonization of uninfected wild juvenile Pacific salmon populations by   ectoparasitic salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) over a 4-year   period. In a data set of 68,376 fish, we observed 85 occurrences of   precopular pair formation among 1,259 preadult female and 613 adult male   lice. The probability of pair formation was dependent on the local   abundance of lice, but this mate limitation is likely offset somewhat by   mate-searching dispersal of males among host fish. A mathematical model   of macroparasite population dynamics that incorporates the empirical   results suggests a high likelihood of a demographic Allee effect, which   can cause the colonizing parasite populations to die out. These results   may provide the first empirical evidence for Allee effects in a   macroparasite. Furthermore, the data give a rare detailed view of Allee   effects in colonization dynamics and suggest that Allee effects may   dampen the spread of parasites in a coastal marine ecosystem.",807,NO,SH,,,

Multiple studies have linked amphibian abnormalities to   chemically contaminated areas, but inference about causal mechanisms is   lacking. Here we use a high incidence of abnormalities in Alaskan wood   frogs to strengthen inference about the mechanism for these   abnormalities. We suggest that limb abnormalities are caused by a   combination of multiple stressors. Specifically, toxicants lead to   increased predation, resulting in more injuries to developing limbs and   subsequent developmental malformations. We evaluated a variety of   putative causes of frog abnormalities at 21 wetlands on the Kenai   National Wildlife Refuge, south-central Alaska, USA, between 2004 and   2006. Variables investigated were organic and inorganic contaminants,   parasite infection, abundance of predatory invertebrates, UVB, and   temperature. Logistic regression and model comparison using the Akaike   information criterion (AIC) identified dragonflies and both organic and   inorganic contaminants as predictors of the frequency of skeletal   abnormalities. We suggest that both predators and contaminants alter   ecosystem dynamics to increase the frequency of amphibian abnormalities   in contaminated habitat. Future experiments should test the causal   mechanisms by which toxicants and predators may interact to cause   amphibian limb abnormalities.",808,NO,SH,,,

Urban transmission of arthropod-vectored disease has increased in   recent decades. Understanding and managing transmission potential in   urban landscapes requires integration of sociological and ecological   processes that regulate vector population dynamics, feeding behaviour   and vector-pathogen interactions in these unique ecosystems. Vectorial   capacity is a key metric for generating predictive understanding about   transmission potential in systems with obligate vector transmission.   This review evaluates how urban conditions, specifically habitat   suitability and local temperature regimes, and the heterogeneity of   urban landscapes can influence the biologically relevant parameters that   define vectorial capacity: vector density, survivorship, biting rate,   extrinsic incubation period and vector competence.   2. Incidence of vector-borne disease in urban host populations is   rarely, if ever, evenly distributed across an urban area. The   persistence and quality of vector habitat can vary significantly across   socio-economic boundaries to influence vector species composition and   abundance, often generating socio-economically distinct gradients of   transmission potential across neighbourhoods.   3. Urban regions often experience unique temperature regimes, broadly   termed urban heat islands (UHI). Arthropod vectors are ectothermic   organisms, and their growth, survival and behaviour are highly sensitive   to environmental temperatures. Vector response to UHI conditions is   dependent on regional temperature profiles relative to the vector's   thermal performance range. In temperate climates, UHI can facilitate   increased vector development rates while having countervailing influence   on survival and feeding behaviour. Understanding how urban heat island   (UHI) conditions alter thermal and moisture constraints across the   vector life cycle to influence transmission processes is an important   direction for both empirical and modelling research.   4. There remain persistent gaps in understanding of vital rates and   drivers in mosquito-vectored disease systems, and vast holes in   understanding for other arthropod-vectored diseases. Empirical studies   are needed to better understand the physiological constraints and   socio-ecological processes that generate heterogeneity in critical   transmission parameters, including vector survival and fitness.   Likewise, laboratory experiments and transmission models must evaluate   vector response to realistic field conditions, such as variability in   sociological and environmental conditions.",809,NO,SH,,,

(2) What is the role of spatial heterogeneity in   sustaining future ecosystem services? We determined that future changes   in each region are likely to be distinct, but spatial heterogeneity   (e.g., the amount and arrangement of surviving forest patches or legacy   trees after disturbance) will be important in both landscapes for   sustaining forest regeneration, primary production, carbon storage,   natural hazard regulation, insect and pathogen regulation, timber   production and wildlife habitat.

In C-3   grasses, foliar fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) can increase plant   resistance to drought and/or produce alkaloids that reduce herbivory -   effects that may also influence host litter composition and subsequent   litter decomposition. We studied the effect of the endophyte Epichloe   sp. on litter decomposition in the Great Lakes dunes (USA) using a   reciprocal design altering endophyte presence/absence in both American   beachgrass Ammophila breviligulata substrate (litter bags) and its   conditioning of the decomposition microenvironment. Symbiont treatments   were crossed with rain-out shelters that altered growing season   precipitation. The first year of decomposition, senesced leaf substrate   from A. breviligulata with Epichloe decomposed 21\% faster than   endophyte-free substrate. By the third year, conditioning by live   symbiotic plants reduced cumulative decomposition by 33\% compared to   plots planted with endophyte-free plants. Of the traits we examined -   litter quantity, C:N ratio, mineral composition, fungal colonization,   and carbon chemistry - increased litter quantity via greater tiller   production was the primary trait shift associated with endophyte   symbiosis. Epichloe in A. breviligulata litter also altered litter   nitrogen decomposition dynamics, as evidenced by lower nitrogen and   protein content in decomposed tissue from plants that hosted the   endophyte. Differences in initial litter quality and subsequent   colonization by saprotrophic fungi were ruled out as key drivers.   Altered precipitation had negligible effects on decomposing processes in   the dunes. Grass-Epichloe symbiosis altered nutrient cycling through   increasing the rate of litter decomposition when present in the litter   and through reducing litter decomposition by conditioning the   decomposition microenvironment. Epichloe are widespread symbionts of   grasses. Thus, their effects on decomposition could be an important, but   often overlooked, driver of nutrient cycling in grass-dominated   ecosystems.",811,NO,SH,,,

The   objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nicosulfuron   spraying and the seeding density of Urochloa brizantha on soil   microbiological attributes. The treatments were arranged in a 2 x 4   factorial design in randomized blocks. The first factor was nicosulfuron   doses (0 and 1/5 of the recommended), and the second factor was the   forage seeding densities (0, 2, 4 and 6 kg of seeds per hectare). Soil   samples were collected 60 days after the emergence of corn plants. The   respiratory rate, carbon associated with microbial biomass, metabolic   quotient, diversity and number of mycorrhizal fungi spores and   mycorrhizal colonization were determined in the soil samples. The   seeding density of U. brizantha interfered with microbial respiration,   metabolic quotient, mycorrhizal colonization and the population of AMFs.   A planting density of 8 kg ha(-1) associated with the application of   nicosulfuron resulted in a lower metabolic quotient.

However, long-term data on hosts, their   parasites, and the corresponding environmental conditions necessary to   explore these interactions are often unavailable. We examined the   dynamics of Daphnia pulicaria, a keystone zooplankter in lake   ecosystems, to explore the long-term causes and consequences of   infection by a chytridiomycete parasitoid (Polycaryum laeve). After   quantifying host-pathogen dynamics from vouchered samples collected over   15 years, we used autoregressive models to evaluate (1) hypothesized   drivers of infection, including host density, water temperature,   dissolved oxygen, host-food availability, and lake mixing; and (2) the   effects of epidemics on host populations. Infection was present in most   years but varied widely in prevalence, from,1\% to 34\%, with seasonal   peaks in early spring and late fall. Within years, lake strati. cation   strongly inhibited P. laeve transmission, such that epidemics occurred   primarily during periods of water mixing. Development of the thermocline   likely reduced transmission by spatially separating susceptible hosts   from infectious zoospores. Among years, ice duration and cumulative   snowfall correlated negatively with infection prevalence, likely because   of reductions in spring phytoplankton and D. pulicaria density in years   with extended winters. Epidemics also influenced dynamics of the host   population. Infected D. pulicaria rarely (< 1\%) contained eggs, and P.   laeve prevalence was positively correlated with sexual reproduction in   D. pulicaria. Analyses of D. pulicaria density-dependent population   dynamics predicted that, in the absence of P. laeve infection, host   abundance would be 11-50\% higher than what was observed. By   underscoring the importance of complex physical processes in controlling   host-parasite interactions and of epidemic disease in influencing host   populations, our results highlight the value of long-term data for   understanding wildlife disease dynamics.",813,YES,SH,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

Scenarios offer a less rigid approach   to thinking about biodiversity change in a policy and management   context. They shift the focus of research and management from making   singular predictions and developing single `best' strategies to   exploring uncertainties and assessing the outcomes of alternative   policies. The four Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) biodiversity   scenarios illustrate current approaches to biodiversity estimation in   global scenarios. The MA biodiversity scenarios are built around the   species-area relationship and the magnitudes of a few area-dependent   processes such as nitrogen deposition and climate change. Some of the   most obvious landscape-related omissions from the MA scenarios are   pattern-process feedbacks, scale dependencies, and the role of landscape   configuration. While the MA has set a new standard for biodiversity   scenarios, future exercises would benefit from a more multi-scale and   more mechanistic framework. I use examples from research on the   landscape ecology and biogeography of African ticks to illustrate how a   hypothesis-based approach can be used to analyse the multi-scale,   multi-level drivers of change in patterns of species occurrences.
