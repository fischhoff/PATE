However, it   is unknown whether prior infection by biotrophic pathogens can lead to   subsequent resistance to necrotrophic pathogens in conifers. We used the   infection of jack pine, Pinus banksiana, by a common biotrophic pathogen   dwarf mistletoe, Arceuthobium americanum, to investigate induced   resistance to a necrotrophic fungus, Grosmannia clavigera, associated   with the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae. Dwarf mistletoe   infection had a non-linear, systemic effect on monoterpene production,   with increasing concentrations at moderate infection levels and   decreasing concentrations at high infection levels. Inoculation with G.   clavigera resulted in 33 times higher monoterpene concentrations and   half the level of phenolics in the necrotic lesions compared to   uninoculated control trees. Monoterpene production following dwarf   mistletoe infection seemed to result in systemic induced resistance, as   trees with moderate disease severity were most resistant to G.   clavigera, as evident from shorter lesion lengths. Furthermore, trees   with moderate disease severity had the highest systemic but lowest local   induction of alpha-pinene after G. clavigera inoculation, suggesting a   possible tradeoff between systemically- and locally-induced defenses.   The opposing effects to inoculation by G. clavigera on monoterpene and   phenolic levels may indicate the potential for biosynthetic tradeoffs by   the tree between these two major defense classes. Our results   demonstrate that interactions between a biotrophic parasitic plant and a   necrotrophic fungus may impact mountain pine beetle establishment in   novel jack pine forests through systemic effects mediated by the   coordination of jack pine defense chemicals.",1900,NO,CS,,,

Significant advances in both mathematical and molecular approaches in   ecology offer unprecedented opportunities to describe and understand   ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks describe interactions between   species, the underlying structure of communities and the function and   stability of ecosystems. They provide the ability to assess the   robustness of complex ecological communities to species loss, as well as   a novel way of guiding restoration. However, empirically quantifying the   interactions between entire communities remains a significant challenge.   2. Concomitantly, advances in DNA sequencing technologies are resolving   previously intractable questions in functional and taxonomic   biodiversity and provide enormous potential to determine hitherto   difficult to observe species interactions. Combining DNA metabarcoding   approaches with ecological network analysis presents important new   opportunities for understanding large-scale ecological and evolutionary   processes, as well as providing powerful tools for building ecosystems   that are resilient to environmental change.   3. We propose a novel `nested tagging' metabarcoding approach for the   rapid construction of large, phylogenetically structured   species-interaction networks. Taking tree-insect-parasitoid ecological   networks as an illustration, we show how measures of network robustness,   constructed using DNA metabarcoding, can be used to determine the   consequences of tree species loss within forests, and forest habitat   loss within wider landscapes. By determining which species and habitats   are important to network integrity, we propose new directions for forest   management.   4. Merging metabarcoding with ecological network analysis provides a   revolutionary opportunity to construct some of the largest,   phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks to date,   providing new ways to: (i) monitor biodiversity and ecosystem   functioning; (ii) assess the robustness of interacting communities to   species loss; and (iii) build ecosystems that are more resilient to   environmental change.",1901,NO,CS,,,

Quail were exposed to malathion in drinking water   at environmentally realistic concentrations (0 ppm, 1 ppm, and 10 ppm).   In the fifth week, several arms of the immune response were tested using   the T-cell based phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test, the B-cell mediated   antibody response, and the chemiluminescence assay measuring innate   immunity. After the sixth week of malathion exposure, quail were   challenged with E. coli O2. The bursa of Fabricius and the spleen were   assessed for histopathology. No clinical signs of malathion toxicity   were observed. Morbidity or mortality subsequent to E. coli exposure   tended (P = 0.08) to be higher in the high exposure group (50.0\%)   compared to the control (22.2\%) group. There was no difference in the   innate immune response in the malathion exposed birds, however, humoral   immunity was suppressed (P = 0.03) with the higher malathion exposure.   Histopathological evaluation revealed an immunosuppressive effect of   malathion on the bursa of Fabricius; bursal atrophy, decreased B-cell   density and increased apoptosis in the medulla, and increased connective   tissue thickness of the follicular epithelium. Antibody suppression was   correlated with bursal changes and peripheral blood lymphocyte count,   the organ and cells involved in antibody production. Following the same   pattern as other immunotoxicity tests, the PHA T-cell proliferative   response also tended to be suppressed in the high exposure group. This   study provides evidence that subchronic, moderate malathion exposure is   immunotoxic to quail and that testing integrated, functional immunity   using an infectious challenge is a better predictor of immunotoxicity   than individual responses to immunotoxicity tests. The secondary   antibody response, circulating lymphocyte populations, and bursal   histopathology were the most sensitive indicators of immune status, as   these predicted decreased disease resistance with malathion exposure.",1902,NO,CS,,,

The processes regulating ungulate populations have been the   focus of numerous studies. For the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer   Sparrman) population inhabiting the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, rinderpest   was the primary regulatory factor up to the mid-1960s. Following   reduction of rinderpest and buffalo population increase, interspecific   competition for food, notably with cattle and wildebeest (Connochaetes   taurinus Burchell), was thought to be the primary regulatory factor in   the ecosystem.   Aims. We analysed buffalo population trends and the relationship between   buffalo population growth and rainfall and density dependence in the   Mara-Serengeti ecosystem and discuss the findings in the context of the   key ecosystem processes governing buffalo population dynamics in African   savannas, namely, food limitation, competition, predation, disease and   land use changes.   Methods. We analysed buffalo population dynamics in the Mara-Serengeti   ecosystem in relation to rainfall and density dependence feedback   between 1984 and 2010.   Key results. Buffalo population growth was both significantly   density-dependent and positively correlated with the dry season rainfall   after, but not before, a severe drought in 1993. Buffalo numbers crashed   by 48.6\% in 1984-85 and by 76.1\% in 1993-94 during severe droughts   when food availability was lowest and competition with the more numerous   cattle and wildebeest was highest.   Conclusions. Recovery of buffalo numbers to pre-drought levels took 8-9   years after the 1984-85 drought but was much slower, with buffaloes   numbering merely 36\% of their 1993 population (12 895 animals) 18 years   after the 1993-94 drought despite intermittent periods of high rainfall,   probably due to demographic and/or reproductive factors, heightened   competition with livestock, land use changes in the adjoining pastoral   ranches, lion predation and recurrent severe droughts.   Implications. Our findings demonstrate how food limitation caused by   droughts associated with the hemispheric El NiNo-Southern Oscillation   can cause severe declines in and threaten the persistence of large   ungulate populations. The findings also portray how density-dependent   food limitation, competition, predation, land use changes and other   factors can accentuate the effect of droughts and greatly prolong   population recovery.",1903,NO,CS,,,
"Taal Levi, Felicia Keesing, Robert D. Holt, Michael Barfield, Richard S. Ostfeld",2016,Quantifying dilution and amplification in a community of hosts for   tick-borne pathogens,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,484-498,484-498,10.1890/15-0122,"Recent controversy over whether biodiversity reduces disease risk   (dilution effect) has focused on the ecology of Lyme disease, a   tick-borne zoonosis. A criticism of the dilution effect is that   increasing host species richness might amplify disease risk, assuming   that total host abundance, and therefore feeding opportunities for   ticks, increase with species richness. In contrast, a dilution effect is   expected when poor quality hosts for ticks and pathogens (dilution   hosts) divert tick blood meals away from competent hosts. Even if host   densities are additive, the relationship between host density and tick   encounters can be nonlinear if the number of ticks that encounter a host   is a saturating function of host density, which occurs if ticks   aggregate on the remaining hosts rather than failing to find a host   before death. Both dilution and amplification are theoretical   possibilities, and assessing which is more prevalent required detailed   analyses of empirical systems. We used field data to explore the degree   of tick redistribution onto fewer individuals with variation in   intraspecific host density and novel data-driven models for tick   dynamics to determine how changes in vertebrate community composition   influence the density of nymphs infected with the Lyme bacterium. To be   conservative, we allowed total host density to increase additively with   species richness. Our long-term field studies found that larval and   nymphal ticks redistribute onto fewer individuals as host densities   decline, that a large proportion of nymphs and adults find hosts, and   that mice and chipmunks feed a large proportion of nymphs. White-footed   mice, eastern chipmunks, short-tailed shrews, and masked shrews were   important amplification hosts that greatly increased the density of   infected nymphs. Gray squirrels and Virginia opossums were important   dilution hosts. Removing these two species increased the maximum number   of larvae attached to amplification hosts by 57\%. Raccoons and birds   were minor dilution hosts under some conditions. Even under the   assumption of additive community assembly, some species are likely to   reduce the density of infected nymphs as diversity increases. If the   assumption of additivity is relaxed, then species that reduce the   density of small mammals through predation or competition might   substantially reduce disease risk.",1904,NO,CS,,,

Previously, host taxonomic communities have been used as indicators of   infectious disease emergence, and the loss of their diversity has been   implicated as a driver of increased presence. The mechanistic details in   how such pathogen-host systems function, however, may not always be   explained by taxonomic variation or loss. Here we used machine learning   and methods based on Gower's dissimilarity to quantify metrics of   invertebrate functional diversity, in addition to functional groups and   their taxonomic diversity at sites endemic and non-endemic for the model   generalist pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of   Buruli ulcer. Changes in these metrics allowed the rapid categorisation   of the ecological niche of the mycobacterium's hosts and the ability to   relate specific host traits to its presence in aquatic ecosystems. We   found that taxonomic diversity of hosts and overall functional diversity   loss and evenness had no bearing on the mycobacterium's presence, or   whether the site was in an endemic area. These findings, however,   provide strong evidence that generalist environmentally persistent   bacteria such as M. ulcerans can be associated with specific functional   traits rather than taxonomic groups of organisms, increasing our   understanding of emerging disease ecology and origin.",1905,NO,CS,,,

In addition. the natural enemies of those in   the third-trophic level may also derive improved fitness from the added   resources. Both these processes will dampen trophic cascades, leading to   less-effective biological control. In this study, the effect of-adding,   different flowering plants on the longevity, egg load, aphid parasitisms   rates are hyperparasitism of Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera:   Braconidae) by its hyperparasitoid Dendrocerus aphidum Rondani   (Hymenoptera: Megaspilidae) were investigated, using the pea aphid   Acrythosiphon pisum Harris (Homoptera: Aphididae) as the herbivore.   Parasitoids exposed to buckwheat survived, oil average, between four to   five times Lis long as those in the control (water) and those in   phacelia, alyssum and coriander treatments survived three to four times   as long. Hyperparasitoids exposed to buckwheat survived five to six   times Lis long as those in the control and three to live times longer   with the other plants compared with the control. Almost all flower   species significantly increased parasitoid and hyperparasitoid egg loads   and the number of parasitised aphids and parasitised mummies compared   with control. Understanding the factors influencing the dynamics of   multitrophic interactions involving flowering plants, herbivores,   parasitoids and hyperparasitoids is a fertile area for future research.   One of the most challenging areas in contemporary ecology concerns the   relative importance of different types of biodiversity mediating trophic   interactions and thereby influencing the structure of communities and   food webs.

Non-native plants can alter both native microbe communities and   ecosystem processes. These changes may indirectly affect native plant   communities. We tested whether an invasive plant influences other plant   species through above- and below-ground microbial associations. These   factors have received less attention than direct competition for   resources in research on plant invasions.   2. Previous work in the mid-western US revealed that the above-ground   fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) in non-native tall fescue   grass (Lolium arundinaceum) reduced establishment of native tree   species, slowing plant succession from grassland to forest relative to   communities lacking the symbiont. Here, we examined potential   soil-mediated mechanisms underlying these negative impacts on trees.   3. We challenged nine tree species with soil conditioned by tall fescue   grass either with (E+) or without (E-) the symbiotic endophyte. We   collected field soil from replicated, experimental E+ and E-field plots,   sterilized half to eliminate soil microbes, then conditioned the soil in   the greenhouse with either E+ or E-tall fescue. Individual tree seeds   received one of five soil treatments: E-live, E sterile, E+ live, E+   sterile, or no tall fescue conditioning (control). Tree survival and   biomass were assessed after approximately 80 days.   4. Soil conditioning by E+ tall fescue reduced the biomass of three tree   species (Elaeagnus umbellata, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Platanus   occidentalis) and the survival of P. occidentalis relative to   conditioning by E-tall fescue. However, decreased biomass occurred only   in live soil, suggesting indirect effects of the endophyte via altered   soil microbes. In addition, two species (F. pennsylvanica, Prunus   serotina) grew larger in both unconditioned soils and E-live soil   relative to all other soil treatments, and two species (Ailanthus   altissima, P. occidentalis) performed poorly in all soil treatments   relative to unconditioned soil. Finally, three species did not   significantly respond to any soil treatment (Acer negundo, Quercus   palustris, Cercis canadensis).   5. Synthesis. Our results show that negative impacts of a non-native   grass on native trees can depend on both above-and below-ground   microbial associations. Because tree species responded divergently to   soil conditioning, the endophyte symbiosis has the potential to alter   plant succession and the future composition of forest communities.",1908,NO,CS,,,

Studies of plant stoichiometry   and stoichiometric homeostasis have focused primarily on the role of   nutrient supply as a constraint on plant tissue chemistry, yet recent   work suggests that local plant diversity, plant species composition and   consumers may change the nutrient composition of whole plant   communities. By experimentally removing insects, foliar fungi and soil   fungi from a long-term experiment manipulating plant diversity, we found   that the foliar stoichiometry of individual plant species depends on   biotic context. Local plant diversity and the composition of the   consumer community each altered foliar tissue carbon and nutrient   chemistry of four different grassland species. The greatest impacts of   consumers on foliar chemistry occurred at low plant diversity, and these   changes induced by altering the food web were of a similar magnitude to   the effects of fertilization or drought found in previous work.   Consumers and plant diversity acted primarily on foliar carbon and   nitrogen, whereas changes in foliar phosphorus were associated with the   productivity of the local plant community. Thus, changes in   whole-community stoichiometry that have been documented in response to   alterations of the consumer food web or plant community are underlain by   stoichiometric changes in individual species as well as plant species   compositional changes.Synthesis. These results suggest a new pathway by   which loss of consumer or plant diversity may significantly impact the   wide variety of ecosystem processes that depend on foliar nutrient   content.",1909,YES,CS,no,effects of PP and non-PP not separable,

There are at least two potential factors, which are not   necessarily closely linked, that animals could measure to estimate costs   of traveling: the time the forager needs to reach the next patch and the   amount of energy it has to invest until arrival. In the parasitoid wasp   Venturia canescens, females forage for hosts from which their offspring   can develop. Two different types of this parasitoid exist. The   thelytokous type lives in anthropogenic habitats where flight is not   necessarily linked with foraging. The arrhenotokous type lives under   field conditions and shows frequent flight activity. We tested whether   the wasps would use time or energy needed to assess patch availability,   by either confining them into vials or letting them travel actively in a   flight mill between patch visits. Our results show that in thelytokous   lines, time is a sufficient cue influencing patch exploitation and an   additional effect of the energy needed was not visible.

We   observed, for the first time, ants using empty cocoons of the   economically important silk moth species, Gonometa postica, as shelter   and nesting sites. Individual trees and individual cocoons were occupied   predominantly by one dominant ant species, although in some cases by   co-occurring ant species. Ant abundance and occurrence were positively   related to cocoon size and the presence of scale insects on branches of   the trees, and negatively influenced by cocoon occupancy by other   invertebrates. Ants also preferred cocoons containing only small   parasite holes as opposed to cocoons containing large moth emergence   holes, suggesting that ants select cocoons based on cocoon   characteristics. Further, these results reveal that other arboreal   invertebrates appear to benefit from cocoon production. Empty cocoons   could be functioning as nest sites and shelters for arboreal   invertebrates, and they could create favourable habitats for other   invertebrates on Vachellia erioloba. Therefore, G. postica acts as an   autogenic ecosystem engineer and current silk harvesting practices,   which partly rely on harvesting empty G. postica cocoons, may have   potential local and large-scale implications for inter-specific   interactions in these arboreal systems.

In a context of climate change, emerging and/or more   aggressive plant diseases are thus expected. It is therefore critical to   understand, anticipate and quantify the effects of climate variability   and climate change on numerous host plant/pathogen systems. For this   purpose, an homogeneous and integrative approach to the disease dynamics   of all airborne fungal pathogens affecting crops is necessary. It   enables to identify when plant-climate-pathogen interactions lead to the   onset or development of one or more pathosystem(s) at a local or   regional scale. We therefore describe here the conceptual design of a   mechanistic model of foliar disease dynamics coupled with a   process-based crop model. This conceptual design proposes generic   response functions based on existing response functions in published   models to simulate climate-based epidemiological processes. The   dispersal and deposition, infection, latency and secondary inoculum   production processes are the modules in this generic model. Input   variables are either climate-related (rain, wind, air temperature, and   air relative humidity) or plant-related (canopy relative humidity,   canopy temperature, host surface wetness, plant phenological stage,   plant and tissue age, organ surfaces, plant nitrogen content and   varietal resistance). We evaluated the general applicability of the   conceptual design using a number of airborne fungal plant pathogens with   contrasted biological behaviours. We successfully completed   proof-of-concept tests, during which disease models for two airborne   fungal pathogens, Plasmopara viticola and Puccinia triticina, were   coupled with the grapevine and wheat versions of the generic crop model   STICS. This revealed the ability of our conceptual design to be   transposed into functional models and then coupled with a classical crop   model.

Many of Darwin's   residential areas were built in close proximity to tidally influenced   swamps, where long-term storm-water run-off from nearby residences into   these swamps has led to anthropogenic induced ecological change. When   natural wet-dry cycles were disrupted, bare mud-flats and mangroves were   transformed into perennial fresh to brackish-water reed swamps. Reed   swamps provided year-round breeding habitat for many mosquito species,   such that mosquito abundance was less predictable and seasonally   dependent, but constant and often occurring in plague proportions.   Drainage channels were constructed throughout the wetlands to reduce   pooled water during dry-season months. This study assesses the impact of   drainage interventions on vegetation and mosquito ecology in three   salt-marshes in the Darwin area. Findings revealed a universal decline   in dry-season mosquito abundance in each wetland system. However, some   mosquito species increased in abundance during wet-season months. Due to   the high expense and potentially detrimental environmental impacts of   ecosystem and non-target species disturbance, large-scale modifications   such as these are sparingly undertaken. However, our results indicate   that some large scale environmental modification can assist the process   of wetland restoration, as appears to be the case for these salt marsh   systems.

Specific relationships between   mycoplankton and other plankton groups were also identified, with   seasonal chytrid blooms matching diatom blooms in consecutive years.   Mycoplankton a-diversity was greatest during periods of reduced salinity   at Station L4, indicative of riverine input to the ecosystem.   Mycoplankton abundance also increased during periods of reduced   salinity, and when potential substrate availability was increased,   including particulate organic matter. This study has identified possible   controlling environmental drivers of mycoplankton diversity and   abundance in a coastal sea ecosystem, and therefore sheds new light on   the biology and ecology of an enigmatic marine plankton group.   Mycoplankton have several potential functional roles, including   saprotrophs and parasites, that should now be considered within the   consensus view of pelagic ecosystem functioning and services.",1915,NO,CS,,,

In this study, two types of coffee   plants, namely Arabica and Robusta, were grown under different   agroforestry management such as coffee under one specialized shade   species, multi-story coffee systems with 2 shade tree species, and   coffee with 3 or more tree species under moist deciduous and evergreen   ecological conditions. Samples were collected from 36 points to include   different coffee ecosystems. The highest number of infective propagules   of AM fungi was encountered in Arabica coffee under evergreen   conditions. Population of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes were higher   under evergreen ecosystem compared to that of deciduous conditions. The   population of nitrogen fixing bacteria was more than double in evergreen   conditions compared to deciduous ecosystem. Number of lignin decomposing   bacteria was higher in evergreen compared to deciduous conditions, but   starch hydrolyzing bacteria and pectin-utilizing bacteria were more in   deciduous ecosystem. Actinomycetes DAT2-1 isolated from deciduous   ecosystem showed antagonistic activity against the root pathogen   Fusarium chlamydosporum. It can be concluded that evergreen coffee   system supports higher population of microorganisms. Of the two species   of coffee, Arabica harboured more AM fungi, bacterial population, N   fixers, P solubilizers and cellulose decomposing organisms while Robusta   harboured higher number of fungi and actinomycetes. Of the three   typologies, coffee grown under two shade tree species supported higher   population of all microorganisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights   reserved.",1916,NO,CS,,,

Such impacts are   anticipated to influence L elliptica physiology, including the immune   system, especially under the current climate change conditions at the   Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). To understand basal immune defence   reactions in L elliptica, we investigated in vitro hemocyte responses   upon bacterial challenge or after stimulation with different substances   of microbial origin (pathogen associated molecular patterns, PAMPS). To   study the age-dependent in vivo response of hemocyte abundance,   starvation and injury experiments were undertaken with young and old   individuals. Hemocytes of L. elliptica feature common immune functions   such as phagocytosis and ROS generation, as well as agglutination of   bacterial cells. ROS generation response to different stimuli was   generally low and lower in larger/older animals compared to   smaller/younger individuals. Physiological conditions such as size/age,   starvation and injury modulated the abundance of hemocytes in L.   elliptica.

PCR and sequencing   of DNA polymerase (polB) and major capsid protein (MCP) genes from algal   viruses, and sheath protein genes from cyanophages, revealed diverse   phytoplankton viruses in the bay. Specifically, polB sequences from the   bay were most closely related to sequences from viruses that infect   prasinophyte algae, MCP sequences were related to sequences from viruses   that infect prasinophytes and from Mimivirus-like viruses that infect   prymnesiophytes and prasinophytes, whilst sheath protein sequences were   related to sequences from the phage Ma-LMM01 that infects M.aeruginosa.   The abundances of 10 distinct viral genes monitored using quantitative   PCR ranged from exceptionally high values (e.g. 256441 gene copies   mL(-1) for a putative M.aeruginosa phage) to values that were just above   detection limits (e.g. a putative Prasinovirus never exceeded 20 gene   copies mL(-1)). Patterns of abundance included genes that were   seasonally sporadic or geographically patchy, as well as some that were   stable throughout the bay over the entire year.

Biofilters, also known as   stormwater bioretention systems or raingardens, have shown promising,   yet variable, results in reducing indicator bacteria in stormwater.   Different biofilter design elements, such as filter media composition   and vegetation type, have been found to cause this variable removal   performance. Although plants play a key role in the treatment of   pollutants, relatively little work has been conducted to understand the   importance of interactions between vegetation and the biofilter   microbial community on fecal microbial removal. A laboratory-scale   biofilter experiment was conducted using Escherichia coli as the test   fecal microorganism. Biofilter columns with differing soil media and   vegetation types were dosed over a two month span, during which inflow   and outflow samples were collected to evaluate system performance. The   columns were then decommissioned to collect rhizosphere and bulk soil   samples. Root exudates were extracted and used in an E. coli survival   study to evaluate their contribution to system performance.

Here, we ask whether the input of marine subsidies in tundra systems   would cause spatial variation in the strength of rodent-plant   interactions between coastal areas, where predators have access to   marine-derived resources, and non-subsidized inland areas of northern   Fennoscandia. We present a detailed evaluation of   predator-rodent-vegetation interactions along a coast-inland gradient,   during the 2011 rodent outbreak and the two following decline years, by   using direct assessments of rodent impacts and tracing of marine-derived   nutrients in the food web. Our results revealed that the main rodent   predator during summer, the long-tailed jaeger Stercorarius longicaudus,   did not benefit from marine resources while breeding (relative dietary   proportion in chicks' diet = 0-3\%). Contrary to this pattern, parasitic   jaegers S. parasiticus, bred exclusively near the coast and preyed   effectively on both marine resources (41\% of chicks' diet) and rodents   (12\%). Mammalian predators also showed a higher activity during winter   near the coast. Despite overall higher predator numbers, no evidence was   found for lower rodent population growth rates during the three   monitoring summers and for weaker rodent grazing impacts in the coastal   area. Instead, we documented pronounced damages caused by lemmings and   voles on bryophytes and vascular plants, especially dwarf shrubs (e.g.   Vaccinum myrtillus) all along the coast-inland gradient. Taken together,   our results did not support the hypothesis that marine subsidies would   trigger a trophic cascade in coastal tundra areas of northern   Fennoscandia during a major rodent outbreak, probably due to a   relatively low diversity of marine-subsidized predators in the region.   Comparative observational and experimental studies at large spatial   scales in various arctic regions are absolutely necessary for a better   understanding of factors causing regional variations in the functioning   of arctic food webs.",1920,NO,CS,,,

As cell numbers declined in the infected cultures due to virus   lysis, a concomitant decrease in fatty acids was observed in the   particulate fraction. The composition of fatty acids within infected E.   huxleyi cells was restructured, with a shift from polyunsaturated to   monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids (respective distributions   changing from 70:10:20\% at the start of the experiment to 44:24:32\% at   the final time point). In particular, decreases were seen in the major   fatty acid 22:6(n-3) and in 18:5(n-3), whereas greatest increases were   seen in 18:1(n-9) and 22:0. The increase in the amount and restructuring   of the fatty acid pool in E. huxleyi was indicative of a combination of   specific and non-specific effects of virus infection. Specific effects   primarily included induction of metabolic pathways such as the synthesis   of components involved in virus replication, the production of virions   and signal transduction via sphingolipid biosynthesis. Non-specific   effects due to stress were likely mediated by reactive oxygen species.   Changes in the composition of virus-infected E. huxleyi are of   significance to the food web since grazing on virus-infected blooms will   decrease the amount of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids passed on   to higher trophic levels.

Negative economic impacts of feral camels mainly   include direct control and management costs, impacts on livestock   production through camels competing with stock for food and other   resources and damage to production-related infrastructure. The annual   net impact cost of feral camels was estimated to be -\$10.67 million for   those elements that could be evaluated according to market values. We   established a positive density/damage relationship for camels and   infrastructure on pastoral properties, which is likely to hold true for   environmental variables and cultural/social variables as well.

Bug A Tub reduced the attractiveness of dung, the   abundance of dung-associated insects in the soil beneath pats, emergent   insect biomass and dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) emergence.   Ivermectin dramatically altered insect assemblages, reducing emergent   fly biomass. lvermectin also reduced emergent dung beetle abundance.

This protein is believed to maintain host   photosynthetic capacity during infection and enhance phage fitness under   high-light conditions. Although the first documented cyanophage-encoded   psbA gene contained a group I intron, this feature has not been widely   reported since, despite a plethora of new sequences becoming available.   In this study, we show that in cyanophage S-PM2, this intron is spliced   during the entire infection cycle. Furthermore, we report the widespread   occurrence of psbA introns in marine metagenomic libraries, and with   psbA often adjacent to a homing endonuclease (HE). Bioinformatic   analysis of the intergenic region between psbA and the adjacent HE gene   F-CphI in S-PM2 showed the presence of an antisense RNA (asRNA)   connecting these two separate genetic elements. The asRNA is   co-regulated with psbA and F-CphI, suggesting its involvement with their   expression. Analysis of scaffolds from global ocean survey datasets   shows this asRNA to be commonly associated with the 30 end of cyanophage   psbA genes, implying that this potential mechanism of regulating marine   `viral' photosynthesis is evolutionarily conserved. Although antisense   transcription is commonly found in eukaryotic and increasingly also in   prokaryotic organisms, there has been no indication for asRNAs in lytic   phages so far.

Predators could reduce disease prevalence in prey populations by   culling infected hosts and reducing host density.

Several possible mechanisms could explain this   `unhealthy herds' effect, including a predator-induced change in   prey/host traits which enhances susceptibility or alters other   epidemiologically important traits.   2. Here, we use an invertebrate predator, zooplankton host, yeast   parasite system to demonstrate such trait-mediated indirect effects. We   exposed ten genotypes of the prey/host Daphnia dentifera to   infochemicals ('kairomones') produced by the invertebrate predator   Chaoborus and to a yeast parasite.   3. We found that kairomone exposure induced larger and more susceptible   D. dentifera. Clones that showed substantial increases in body length   also yielded more spores upon death. However, exposure to kairomones did   not alter reproduction from uninfected hosts. All of these results were   captured with a dynamic energy budget model of parasitism.   4.

Epiphytic lichens decline in   abundance and diversity in areas with high N loads, and the abundance of   lichens decreases along gradients of increased deposition. Thus,   although N is an essential nutrient for lichens, excessive loads may be   detrimental for them. However, these gradients include many correlated   pollutants and the mechanisms behind the decline are thus poorly known.   The aim of this study was to assess effects of N deposition, alone, on   the epiphytic lichen community composition in a naturally N-poor boreal   forest. For this purpose, whole spruce trees were fertilized daily with   N at five levels, equivalent to 0.6, 6, 12.5, 25, and 50 kg N ha-1 yr-1,   during four consecutive growing seasons (20062009), and changes in the   abundance of lichens were monitored each autumn from the preceding year   (2005). The studied lichen communities were highly dynamic and responded   strongly to the environmental perturbation. N deposition detectably   altered the direction of succession and reduced the species richness of   the epiphytic lichen communities, even at the lowest fertilization   application (6 kg N ha-1 yr-1). The simulated N deposition caused   significant changes in the abundance of Alectoria sarmentosa, Bryoria   spp., and Hypogymnia physodes, which all increased at low N loads and   decreased at high loads, but with species-specific optima. The rapid   decline of A. sarmentosa may have been caused by the added nitrogen   reducing the stability of the lichen thalli, possibly due to increases   in the photobiont: mycobiont ratio or parasitic fungal attacks. We   conclude that increases in nitrogen availability, per se, could be   responsible for the reductions in lichen abundance and diversity   observed along deposition gradients, and those community responses may   be due to physiological responses of the individual species rather than   changes in competitive interactions.",1928,NO,CS,,,

In order to test whether natural enemies will affect range expansion   dynamics, we transplanted seven species along a 450-km latitudinal   gradient that spanned the range edges of five of these species. The   experiment was conducted over 5years with 13000 seedlings and included   pesticide treatments to reduce invertebrate herbivory. We measured   foliar damage caused by disease and invertebrate herbivores, seedling   survival, light availability, soil moisture, soil nutrient   concentrations and several other variables in nine forests located in   four regions along the latitudinal gradient.   We found that several species (Carya glabra, Liriodendron tulipifera,   Quercus velutina and Robinia pseudoacacia) tended to have less foliar   disease beyond their range, but there were few substantial differences   in herbivory across range edges (with the exception of Liriodendron   tulipifera). After accounting for other variables, including   environmental conditions and vertebrate herbivory, we found that foliar   disease decreased survival for four species (Acer rubrum, Quercus alba,   Quercus rubra and Quercus velutina) and foliar herbivory reduced   survival for three species (Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera and   Quercus rubra).

For species at risk of extinction from   disease important questions remain unanswered, including when does   disease become a threat to species and does it co-occur, predictably,   with other threats? Using newly compiled data from the International   Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, we examined the   relative role and co-occurrence of threats associated with amphibians,   birds, and mammals at 6 levels of extinction risk (i.e., Red List status   categories: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered,   critically endangered, and extinct in the wild/extinct). We tested the   null hypothesis that the proportion of species threatened by disease is   the same in all 6 Red List status categories. Our approach revealed a   new method for determining when disease most frequently threatens   species at risk of extinction. The proportion of species threatened by   disease varied significantly between IUCN status categories and linearly   increased for amphibians, birds, and all species combined as these taxa   move from move from least concern to critically endangered. Disease was   infrequently the single contributing threat. However, when a species was   negatively affected by a major threat other than disease (e.g., invasive   species, land-use change) that species was more likely to be   simultaneously threatened by disease than species that had no other   threats. Potential drivers of these trends include ecological factors,   clustering of phylogenetically related species in Red List status   categories, discovery bias among species at greater risk of extinction,   and availability of data.

Parasites comprise a substantial proportion of global biodiversity   and exert important ecological influences on hosts, communities and   ecosystems, but our knowledge of how parasite populations respond to   human impacts is in its infancy. Here, we present the results of a   natural experiment in which we used a system of highly successful marine   protected areas and matched open-access areas in central Chile to assess   the influence of fishing-driven biodiversity loss on parasites of   exploited fish and invertebrate hosts. We measured the burden of gill   parasites for two reef fishes (Cheilodactylus variegatus and   Aplodactylus punctatus), trematode parasites for a keyhole limpet   (Fissurella latimarginata), and pinnotherid pea crab parasites for a sea   urchin (Loxechinus albus). We also measured host density for all four   hosts. We found that nearly all parasite species exhibited substantially   greater density (\# parasites m(-2)) in protected than in open-access   areas, but only one parasite species (a gill monogenean of C.variegatus)   was more abundant within hosts collected from protected relative to   open-access areas. These data indicate that fishing can drive declines   in parasite abundance at the parasite population level by reducing the   availability of habitat and resources for parasites, but less commonly   affects the abundance of parasites at the infrapopulation level (within   individual hosts). Considering the substantial ecological role that many   parasites play in marine communities, fishing and other human impacts   could exert cryptic but important effects on marine community structure   and ecosystem functioning via reductions in parasite abundance.",1937,NO,CS,,,

Yet, few empirical studies demonstrate amplification.   This contrast may occur because few studies have considered the   multivariate nature of disease risk, which includes richness and   abundance of parasites with different transmission modes. By combining a   multivariate statistical model developed for   biodiversity-ecosystem-multifunctionality with an extensive field   manipulation of host (plant) richness, composition and resource supply   to hosts, we reveal that (i) host richness alone could not explain most   changes in disease risk, and (ii) shifting host composition allowed   disease amplification, depending on parasite transmission mode.   Specifically, as predicted from theory, the effect of host diversity on   parasite abundance differed for microbes (more density-dependent   transmission) and insects (more frequency-dependent transmission). Host   diversity did not influence microbial parasite abundance, but nearly   doubled insect parasite abundance, and this amplification effect was   attributable to variation in host composition. Parasite richness was   reduced by resource addition, but only in species-rich host communities.   Overall, this study demonstrates that multiple drivers, related to both   host community and parasite characteristics, can influence disease risk.

To determine whether natural enemies could exert   selection on plant secondary chemistry, pathogen infestation and   invertebrate herbivory were measured on 10 genotypes of Senecio jacobaea   (Tansy Ragwort) at two experimental field sites during a 2-year period.   The genotypes represented two chemotypes based on the presence of the   pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) jacobine and erucifoline. At one site,   Heteren, mainly generalist herbivores were present. Here, damage was   limited and did not differ among genotypes or chemotypes. At the other   site, Meijendel, several specialists attacked the plants. Damage   increased during the year, with a peak in July when most damage was   caused by the specialist moth Tyria jacobaeae. At this peak there was no   difference in damage among chemotypes. In the months prior to T.   jacobaeae damage, chemotypes with jacobine were more severely attacked   by specialists than the chemotypes without jacobine. Total damage during   that period was positively correlated with both total PA concentration   and jacobine concentration. Probably plant vigor also played a role in   host preference since damage per individual plant was positively   correlated with plant size. Our results suggest that total PA   concentration and specifically jacobine had a positive effect on   specialist feeding, indicating ecological costs involved in the   production of PAs.

Mean air temperature was raised by 3.6 degrees C with warming   chambers. Vegetation responses were negligible for all treatments for   the first four years, and no sulfur effect was seen during the course of   the experiment.

Over the same period, total   vascular plant cover ( of the graminoid Eriophorum vaginatum and the two   dwarf-shrubs Andromeda polifolia and Vaccinium oxycoccos) increased from   24\% to an average of 70\% in the N plots. Nitrogen addition caused leaf   N concentrations to rise in the two dwarf-shrubs, while for E.   vaginatum, leaf N remained unchanged, indicating that the graminoid to a   larger extent than the dwarf-shrubs allocated supplemented N to growth.

AMF and rhizobia responses were each influenced by   the other, but not in the same direction. AMF infection increased root   nodule number and mass, but rhizobia inoculation decreased AMF hyphal   colonization of roots. The relative benefits of each combination of   symbionts depended upon phosphorus level. The effect of nitrogen was   also contingent on the biotic environment where nitrogen addition   decreased nodulation, but this decrease was reduced with coinfection by   AMF.

Here, we evaluate the landscape-level co-dependence of insecticide-based   and natural enemy-based pest management using a simulation model for   parasitoid-host interactions in landscapes consisting of conventionally   and organically managed fields. In our simulations conventional   management consists of broad-spectrum or selective insecticide   application, while organic management involves no insecticides.   Simulations indicate that insecticide use can easily result in lose-lose   scenarios whereby both organically and conventionally managed fields   suffer from increased pest loads as compared to a scenario where no   insecticides are used, but that under some conditions insecticide use   can be compatible with biocontrol. Simulations also suggest that the   pathway to achieve the insecticide reduction without triggering   additional pest pressure is not straightforward, because increasing the   proportion of organically managed fields or reducing the spray frequency   in conventional fields can potentially give rise to dramatic increases   in pest load. The disruptive effect of insecticide use, however, can be   mitigated by spatially clustering organic fields and using selective   insecticides, although the effectiveness of this mitigation depends on   the behavioral traits of the biocontrol agents. Poorly dispersing   parasitoids and parasitoids with high attack rates required a lower   amount of organically managed fields for effective pest suppression.

Both foliar and root herbivory can alter the exudation of carbon from   plant roots, which in turn can affect nitrogen availability in the soil.   However, few studies have investigated the effects of herbivory on N   fluxes from roots, which can directly increase N availability in the   soil and uptake by neighbouring plants. Moreover, the combined effects   of foliar and root herbivory on N fluxes remains unexplored.   2. We subjected the legume white clover (Trifolium repens L.) to   defoliation (through clipping) and root herbivory (by an obligate   root-feeding nematode, Heterodera trifolii Goggart) to examine how these   stresses individually, and simultaneously, affected the transfer of T.   repens-derived N to neighbouring perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)   plants using N-15 stable-isotope techniques. We also examined the   effects of defoliation and root herbivory on the size of the soil   microbial community and the growth response of L. perenne.   3. Neither defoliation nor root herbivory negatively affected T. repens   biomass. On the contrary, defoliation increased root biomass (34\%) and   total shoot production by T. repens (100\%). Furthermore, defoliation   resulted in a fivefold increase in T. repens-derived N-15 recovered in   L. perenne roots, and increased the size of the soil microbial biomass   (77\%). In contrast, root herbivory by H. trifolii slightly reduced N-15   transfer from T. repens to L. perenne when T. repens root N-15   concentration was included as a covariate, and root herbivory did not   affect microbial biomass. Growth of L. perenne was not affected by any   of the treatments.   4.

We tested how plant selection and soil legacy   influence biodiversity effects on productivity, and whether such effects   increase the resistance of the communities to invasion by weeds. We used   two plant selection treatments: parental plants growing in monoculture   or in mixture over 8 yr in a grassland biodiversity experiment in the   field, which we term monoculture types and mixture types. The two   soil-legacy treatments used in this study were neutral soil inoculated   with live or sterilized soil inocula collected from the same plots in   the biodiversity experiment. For each of the four factorial   combinations, seedlings of eight species were grown in monocultures or   four-species mixtures in pots in an experimental garden over 15 weeks.   Soil legacy (live inoculum) strongly increased biodiversity   complementarity effects for communities of mixture types, and to a   significantly weaker extent for communities of monoculture types. This   may be attributed to negative plant-soil feedbacks suffered by mixture   types in monocultures, whereas monoculture types had positive plant-soil   feedbacks, in both monocultures and mixtures. Monocultures of mixture   types were most strongly invaded by weeds, presumably due to increased   pathogen susceptibility, reduced biomass, and altered plant-soil   interactions of mixture types. These results show that biodiversity   effects in experimental grassland communities can be modified by the   evolution of positive vs. negative plant-soil feedbacks of plant   monoculture vs. mixture types.",1948,NO,CS,,,

Heuristic models have predicted both increases and decreases in   parasite abundance in response to human disturbance, with empirical   support for both. However, most studies focus on one or a few selected   parasite species. Here, we assess the abundance of parasites of seven   species of coral reef fishes collected from three fished and three   unfished islands of the Line Islands archipelago in the central   equatorial Pacific. Because we chose fish hosts that spanned different   trophic levels, taxonomic groups, and body sizes, we were able to   compare parasite responses across a broad cross section of the total   parasite community in the presence and absence of fishing, a major human   impact on marine ecosystems. We found that overall parasite species   richness was substantially depressed on fished islands, but that the   response of parasite abundance varied among parasite taxa: directly   transmitted parasites were significantly more abundant on fished than on   unfished islands, while the reverse was true for trophically transmitted   parasites. This probably arises because trophically transmitted   parasites require multiple host species, some of which are the top   predators most sensitive to fishing impacts. The increase in directly   transmitted parasites appeared to be due to fishing-driven compensatory   increases in the abundance of their hosts. Together, these results   provide support for the predictions of both heuristic models, and   indicate that the direction of fishing's impact on parasite abundance is   mediated by parasite traits, notably parasite transmission strategies.",1949,NO,CS,,,

In this paper, we   set up a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model to analyze the   transferring routes of TSPM emissions between urban ecosystem and   surrounding regions through trades. TSPM emission from particulate   source regions and sectors are identified by analyzing the embodied TSPM   flows through inter-regional trade. The track of TSPM from origin to end   via consumption activities is also revealed by tracing the product   supply chain associated with the TSPM emissions. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei   (Jing-Jin-Ji) as the most industrialized district of China is selected   for a case study. The result shows that over 70\% of TSPM emissions   associated with goods consumed in Beijing and Tianjin occurred outside   of their own administrative boundaries, implying that Beijing and   Tianjin are net TSPM exporters. Meanwhile, 63\% of the total TSPM   emissions in Hebei province are resulted from the outside demand,   indicating Hebei is a net importer. In addition, nearly half of TSPM   emissions are the by-products related to electricity and heating supply   and non-metal mineral production in Jing-Jin-Ji district. Based on the   modeling results, we provided new insights into establishing systemic   strategies and identifying mitigation priorities to stem TSPM emissions   in urban ecosystem and its surrounding areas.

But most   rangeland fire research occurs in a wildfire context, is focused on fire   effects, or simply assumes that grass-dominated fuelbeds are   homogeneous. In this study, we sampled fuel moisture from several   species in two grassland locations in South Africa to determine (1) if   grassland fuels cure differently among species or across locations, (2)   whether differences in curing meaningfully affect fire behaviour, and   (3) if fuel moisture is associated with soil moisture. Data were   characterised by high variability among sampling sites and dates, which   highlights the importance of accounting for-rather than averaging   out-variation with hierarchical analysis. Variability among locations   and species indicates that broad similarities among plant communities do   not adequately describe fuelbed dynamics. We observed patterns in the   C-3 Festuca costata that deviated from general patterns in C-4 grasses,   particularly in grasslands at the edge of environmentally determined   transitions. These differences might have landscape-level implications   under global environmental change. The temporal breadth and   species-level specificity of our study constitute novel data that   identify further research to improve the understanding of fuelbed   ecology in grasslands worldwide, beyond the context of extreme fire   weather and behaviour. Our data suggest that managers in South Africa   and abroad should consider heterogeneity within grassland fuelbeds and   recognize seasonal changes to ensure that objectives are obtainable   ahead of burns, and to explain spatial variation in response within what   might have appeared to be a homogeneous grassland fuelbed.",1951,NO,CS,,,

At two   sites where L. perenne was already present, the addition of L. perenne   seeds had no significant effect on the shoot biomass of the species,   indicating that these populations were not seed limited. Exposure to the   pathogen resulted in disease, and infected L. perenne populations showed   increased shoot biomass over the course of the 3 year experiment and at   harvest the final year, but no effect on seed production. Reproductive   allocation was not affected by disease exposure in disturbed plots, but   decreased in the presence of disease in undisturbed plots. The increased   biomass observed in the semi-natural plant communities when exposed to   the pathogen contrasts with the reduced biomass observed in garden   experiments when the two cultivars of L. perenne were exposed to   pathogen attack.

We questioned whether leaf litter   inputs that are also associated with canopy cover might also alter Bd   growth. Leaf litter inputs exhibit tremendous interspecific chemical   variation, and we hypothesized that Bd growth varies with leachate   chemistry. We also hypothesized that Bd uses leaf litter as a growth   substrate. To test these hypotheses, we conducted laboratory trials in   which we exposed cultures of Bd to leachate of 12 temperate leaf litter   species at varying dilutions. Using a subset of those 12 litter species,   we also exposed Bd to pre-leached litter substrate. We found that   exposure to litter leachate and substrate reduced Bd spore and sporangia   densities, although there was substantial variation among treatments. In   particular, Bd densities were inversely correlated with concentrations   of phenolic acids. We conducted a field survey of phenolic   concentrations in natural wetlands which verified that the leachate   concentrations in our lab study are ecologically relevant.

This type of spread is   called a `patchy spread'. in earlier models, this phenomenon was   considered to be a result of a pronounced environmental or/and   demographic stochasticity. Recently, it was found that a patchy spread   can arise in a fully deterministic predator-prey system and in models of   infectious diseases; in each case the process takes place in a   homogeneous environment. it is well recognized that the observed   patterns of patchy spread in nature are a result of interplay between   stochastic and deterministic factors. However, the models considering   deterministic mechanism of patchy spread are developed and studied much   less compared to those based on stochastic mechanisms. A further   progress in the understanding of the role of deterministic factors in   the patchy spread would be extremely helpful. Here we apply   multi-species reaction-diffusion models of two spatial dimensions in a   homogeneous environment. We demonstrate that patterns of patchy spread   are rather common for the considered approach, in particular, they arise   both in mutualism and competition models influenced by predation. We   show that this phenomenon can occur in a system without a strong Allee   effect, contrary to what was assumed to be crucial in earlier models.

We found that the intrinsic growth rate of Caenorhabditis elegans   in laboratory culture increased asymptotically with prey richness. The   mechanism of this pattern was primarily due to the best available prey   species in the mixture: the intrinsic growth rate of the consumer   feeding on a mixture of prey was approximately equal to the intrinsic   growth rate of the predator when feeding on the single best prey in   monoculture. This was analogous to the selection effect observed in   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Generation time, and   not reproductive output, was the life history trait component that was   most consistent with the pattern of intrinsic growth rate.

For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds   that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits   for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop   rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial   diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance   disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant   diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased   abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used   a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity   through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease   suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop   diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and   a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence   on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing   antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial   community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with   cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1-3   crop species diversity treatments.

Via a resurrection ecology approach, we isolated two Daphnia   subpopulations from different depths in a sediment core, which were   exposed to parasites and a nutrient ratio gradient in a common garden   experiment. Our results showed a genetic basis for sensitivity towards   food deprivation. Both fecundity and host survival was differently   affected when fed with low-quality food.

A historical   reconstruction of nutrient changes in a sediment core reflected an   increase in organic material and phosphorus concentration (more   eutrophic conditions) over time in the studied pond. These results   enable us to relate patterns of genetic differentiation in sensitivity   towards food deprivation to an increasing level of eutrophication of the   subpopulations, which ultimately impacts parasite virulence effects.   This finding was confirmed via a dynamic energy budgets (DEB), in which   energy was partitioned for the host and the parasite.

Unfortunately, herbivorous   arthropod pests are often more abundant on urban than rural trees,   reducing tree growth, survival, and ecosystem services. Previous   research where vegetation complexity was reduced has attributed elevated   urban pest abundance to decreased regulation by natural enemies.   However, reducing vegetation complexity, particularly the density of   overstory trees, also makes cities hotter than natural habitats. We ask   how urban habitat characteristics influence an abiotic factor,   temperature, and a biotic factor, natural enemy abundance, in regulating   the abundance of an urban forest pest, the gloomy scale, (Melanaspis   tenebricosa). We used a map of surface temperature to select red maple   trees (Acer rubrum) at warmer and cooler sites in Raleigh, North   Carolina, USA. We quantified habitat complexity by measuring impervious   surface cover, local vegetation structural complexity, and landscape   scale vegetation cover around each tree. Using path analysis, we   determined that impervious surface (the most important habitat variable)   increased scale insect abundance by increasing tree canopy temperature,   rather than by reducing natural enemy abundance or percent parasitism.   As a mechanism for this response, we found that increasing temperature   significantly increases scale insect fecundity and contributes to   greater population increase. Specifically, adult female M. tenebricosa   egg sets increased by approximately 14 eggs for every 1 degrees C   increase in temperature. Climate change models predict that the global   climate will increase by 2-3 degrees C in the next 50-100 years, which   we found would increase scale insect abundance by three orders of   magnitude. This result supports predictions that urban and natural   forests will face greater herbivory in the future, and suggests that a   primary cause could be direct, positive effects of wauning on herbivore   fitness rather than altered trophic interactions.",1967,MAYBE,CS,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,effects on host abundance but not biomass

However, CDV often appears to   move between populations that are ecologically isolated, possibly   through bridge hosts that interact with both species. This study   investigated how an introduced species could alter multihost   interactions and act as a bridge host in a novel carnivore assemblage of   domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), invasive American mink (Neovison   vison), and threatened river otters (Lontra provocax) in southern Chile.

No interactions were observed between   dogs and otters at either location.

However, there is   growing concern that increasing levels of burning, particularly on deep   peat, are impacting upon upland ecosystems. We used linear mixed models   to examine the influence of burning on heather Calluna vulgaris (L.)   height and structure, and on grouse density and breeding success, at 36   moors in northern England which practiced driven grouse shooting and   employed full-time gamekeepers to burn heather, but also to control   generalist predators of grouse and their parasitic nematode worms.   Variation in heather height was positively associated with burning   extent on moors and the relationship between heather height and burning   was similar on moors of deep (blanket bog) and shallow peat (heath).   Grouse pre-breeding density was not related to burning extent, but   breeding success and post-breeding density were positively associated   with extent of burning on moors. Relationships between grouse and   burning were similar on heath and blanket bog. Higher grouse breeding   success and post-breeding density were likely to be associated with a   more varied vegetation structure following burning. Rotational burning   is associated with higher grouse breeding success and post-breeding   densities beneficial for driven grouse shooting. Thus a conflict may   exist between rotational burning to benefit grouse and potential impacts   of burning on ecosystem services such as carbon storage and flood   protection. Potential benefits of burning for increasing grouse breeding   success and post-breeding density need to be considered carefully   against any likely impacts on ecosystem services, particularly in areas   of blanket peat.",1969,NO,CS,,,

Recent studies have related the higher productivity in   diverse plant communities to suppression of pathogenic soil biota. If   soil biota plays a role in diversity-productivity relationships, the   question remains about how they may influence complementarity and   selection effects. Here we examine how complementarity and selection   effects may depend on soil biota using a plant-soil feedback approach.   We used monocultures and mixtures of early successional plant species,   which are known to have mostly negative plant-soil feedback effects, and   mid-successional plant species, which generally have neutral plant-soil   feedback. We found that plant-soil feedback effects differed between   monocultures and mixed plant communities, as well as between early and   mid-successional plants. This resulted in a significant interaction   effect between diversity and successional stage. In monocultures,   plant-soil feedback tended to be negative for early and positive for   mid-successional plant species. Interestingly, the community feedback   responses of the mixed communities were opposite, being positive for   early and negative for mid-successional community. Plant-soil feedback   differentially affected complementarity and selection effects of early   and mid-successional plant communities: it enhanced complementarity   effects of early and decreased selection effects of mid-successional   species.Synthesis. Soil biota that drive plant-soil feedback effects can   influence the diversity-productivity relationship not only through   decreased biomass production in monocultures compared to mixtures, but   also through influencing complementarity and selection effects among   species in mixed plant communities. Our results reveal that   biodiversity-productivity relationships depend on plant-soil feedback   interactions, which depend on the successional position of the plant. We   propose that including successional position and trait-based analyses of   plant-soil feedback in diversity-functioning studies will enhance   understanding consequences of biodiversity loss for productivity and   other ecosystem processes.",1970,NO,CS,,,

We investigated the principal hypothesis that environmental   by-products of agricultural activity mediate parasitism in native frogs.   Bullfrogs were collected from wetlands with variable landscape   disturbance and water quality and examined for helminth parasites. We   predicted that pesticide pollution and landscape development would be   significant factors shaping the parasite communities and populations.   Parasite diversity and species richness were lower in wetlands impacted   by both pesticides and land use. Two parasite groups, direct life-cycle   nematodes and echinostomes, were common in polluted habitats,   potentially increasing frog pathology and mortality risk. In areas with   agricultural landscape and reduced forest cover, parasite diversity and   species richness were low, perhaps because of less parasite transmission   from birds and mammals. This result suggests that land development   limits terrestrial vertebrate access to wetlands. Our results indicate   that parasite abundance and community structure in wetlands are   influenced by factors operating locally within the wetland and more   broadly in the surrounding landscape. We suggest that parasite   communities in amphibians are effective indicators of ecosystem health   and animal biodiversity, and thus useful tools for conservation biology.

Changes in nutrient availability   can also modify the stoichiometry and condition of individual hosts,   which may affect their susceptibility for parasites as well as the   growth conditions for parasites within the host. Consequently, if not   balanced by increased host immuno-competence or life history responses,   changes in the magnitude of parasite effects with increasing nutrient   availability are expected. If these parasite effects are host-species   specific, this may lead to shifts in the host community structure. We   here used the Daphnia-parasite model system to study the effect of   nutrient enrichment on parasite-mediated competition in experimental   mesocosms. In the absence of parasites, D. magna was competitively   dominant to D. pulex at both low and high nutrient levels. Introduction   of parasites resulted in infections of D. magna, but not of D. pulex   and, as such, reversed the competitive hierarchy between these two   species. Nutrient addition resulted in an increased prevalence and   infection intensity of some of the parasites on D. magna.

This is due   to the complexity of soil ecosystems, presenting significant challenges   to their study in situ. Many theoretical and simulation models have been   developed to link nutrient levels to colony dynamics. Unfortunately,   there is currently no model that can take both structural and   nutritional microscale heterogeneity into account, and is parameterised   for the soil environment. In this context, the objective of this article   is to develop such a 3D spatially explicit model of fungal dynamics, and   to calibrate it for a soil system using data from the literature. A   sensitivity analysis is carried out to better understand the   uncertainties in the input parameters and their effect on colony   dynamics in terms of biomass yield and respiration rates. The results   highlight simulation outcomes that are most suited to validation by   experimentation. The results also indicate that predictions in biomass   yield are sensitive to uncertainties in model parameters relative to the   soil fungal complex that at this point are insufficiently understood   experimentally and still have to be estimated by model fitting. The   latter parameters, which influence biomass yield and respiration, are   associated with biomass recycling processes such as adsorption   (,alpha(ni)) desorption (beta(ni), beta(i)) insulation (zeta(ni)) and   biomass yield efficiency (epsilon(1)), and translocation (D-v). The   model now opens up great opportunities for hypothesis-driven research,   combining theoretical models and novel types of experimentation,   especially given the recently acquired ability to generate artificial,   replicable soil-like microcosms on which to test model predictions.

Methods: We obtained BEF relationships from vertebrate scavengers   consuming ungulate carcasses monitored through motion-triggered remote   cameras. We used the Price equation to tease out the relative roles of   species richness, composition and abundance in the scavenging efficiency   of vertebrates.   Results: We recorded 46 vertebrate scavenging species, 30 in Spain and   16 in South Africa. Two main patterns drove BEF relationships. Species   richness and composition drove carcass consumption in ecosystems where   functionally dominant scavengers were rare, whilst context dependent   effects (including species abundance) did so where functionally dominant   species were common. Contrastingly to previous studies, abundance   fluctuations in vertebrate scavengers were not exclusively related to   common species but to the specialization of obligate scavengers (i.e.,   Gyps vultures) to rapidly gather at carcasses and to the top-down   control exerted by large predators.   Main conclusions: Rare and threatened species such as vultures and top   predators become functionally key species in scavenging processes,   highlighting that the delivery of ecosystem services still stands as a   general argument for biodiversity conservation in vertebrate   communities. Human persecution of vultures and top predators worldwide   is expected to alter ecosystem functioning and services such as nutrient   recycling or disease control.",1983,NO,CS,,,

Few studies have directly addressed the role played by parasites in   the structure and function of ecosystems. Parasites influence the   behaviour, reproduction and overall fitness of their hosts, but have   been usually overlooked in community and ecosystem-level studies. We   investigated the effects of trematode parasites on snail-periphyton   interactions.   2. Physa acuta (Gastropoda: Pulmonata) snails infected with the   trematode Posthodiplostomum minimum (often > 30\% of within-shell   biomass) grazed more rapidly than uninfected snails. Trematode effects   on snail grazing indirectly affected the standing stock and community   structure of periphyton. Populations of snails with 50\% infected   individuals reduced algal biomass by 20\% more than populations with   lesser (10\% or 0\%) infection rates.   3. The alga Cladophora glomerata dominated periphyton communities grazed   by snail populations with 50\% infection rates, whereas diatoms and   blue-green algal taxa dominated when grazed by snail populations with   lower infection rates.   4. Thus, trematodes indirectly affected periphyton communities by   altering host snail behaviour, a trait-mediated indirect effect. These   results indicate that trematodes can indirectly influence benthic   community structure beyond simple population fitness, with possible   related effects on ecosystem function.",1984,YES,CS,yes,,

Despite this growing problem, the long-term   consequences of infectious disease in marine ecosystems remain poorly   understood, and the application of epidemiological models to marine   disease systems represents a research priority for managing resources in   the world's oceans.   Metapopulation models may provide a framework for modelling coral   population dynamics at the regional scale, and we use this approach to   investigate the effects of infectious disease. The model presented here   incorporates a susceptible-infected or `S-I' disease into a system of   patchily distributed, dynamic coral hosts, and highlights some basic   differences that set many marine disease systems apart from their   terrestrial counterparts.   The model predicts several possible long-term outcomes of disease   introduction, and suggests that the consequences of disease may vary   considerably among different pathogens and regions. Due to the long   time-scales for coral dynamics, epizootics are expected to be prolonged   with recovery slow at the regional scale.   Our model results show how infectious disease can substantially alter   host metapopulation dynamics, with some non-linear relationships which   are likely to affect the response of these systems to management and   environmental change. For example, higher rates of coral colonization   can have variable consequences for host population occupancy (i.e. coral   cover) when infectious disease is considered, and chronic diseases with   long-lived pathogens pose the highest risks for regional coral   extinction.   Synthesis and applications. We present a tractable epidemiological model   within a metapopulation framework and compare the model output with   empirical data for a white plague type II (WPII) outbreak among coral of   the upper Florida Keys. We conclude that this model fits well with the   spatial and temporal patterns of WPII over a decade. Despite   terrestrial-marine differences, many patterns derived from our model are   consistent with epidemiological principles. Thus, the careful   application of these principles within the context of marine management   may be a promising research frontier. Although we focus on coral   disease, the methods and results may apply to other marine   metapopulations.",1985,NO,CS,,,

The rate and extent of pathogen spread are thought to be   partially controlled by variation in host characteristics, such as when   host size and location influence susceptibility. Few host-pathogen   systems, however, have been used to test this prediction. We used Port   Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), a foundation tree species in   riparian areas of California and Oregon (USA), and the invasive oomycete   Phytophthora lateralis to assess pathogen impacts and the role of host   characteristics on invasion. Across three streams that had been infected   for 13-18 years by P. lateralis, we mapped 2241 trees and determined   whether they had been infected using dendrochronology. The infection   probability of trees was governed by host size (diameter at breast   height [DBH]) and geomorphic position (e.g., active channel, stream   bank, floodplain, etc.) similarly across streams. For instance, only   23\% of trees,20 cm DBH were infected, while 69\% of trees >= 20 cm DBH   were infected. Presumably, because spores of P. lateralis are   transported downstream in water, they are more likely to encounter   well-developed root systems of larger trees. Also because of this   water-transport of spores, differences in infection probability were   found across the geomorphic positions: 59\% of cedar in the active   channel and the stream bank (combined) were infected, while 23\% of   trees found on higher geomorphic types were infected. Overall, 32\% of   cedar had been infected across the three streams. However, 63\% of the   total cedar basal area had been killed, because the greatest number of   trees, and the largest trees, were found in the most susceptible   positions. In the active channel and stream bank, 91\% of the basal area   was infected, while 46\% was infected across higher geomorphic   positions. The invasion of Port Orford cedar populations by P. lateralis   causes profound impacts to population structure and the invasion outcome   will be governed by the heterogeneity found in host size and location.

Hemiparasitic plants, such as Rhinanthus species, have substantial   effects on community composition and biomass. For example, the presence   of parasites often increases diversity but reduces the combined biomass   of hosts and parasites by c. 25\% compared with unparasitized controls.   We present and test a simple model of the host-parasite interaction in   which parasite growth rate is a function of host growth rate that offers   a new explanation for why hemiparasitic plants reduce ecosystem   productivity.   2. The model predicts that the combined mass of the host-parasite system   is always less than the mass of the host grown alone, because the   combined biomass is dependent only on host growth rate, which is reduced   by the parasite. The model also predicts that the parasite should adopt   an intermediate virulence to maximize its own performance, but that the   optimum virulence depends on host growth characteristics.   3. The key assumption of the model is that parasite growth rate and   hence parasite biomass is tightly coupled to host growth rate. We tested   this assumption by measuring the performance of Rhinanthus   alectorolophus, a widespread hemiparasitic annual plant, on nine common   European grass species. First, we determined size-corrected growth rates   for the grasses by fitting power-law growth curves to multiple-harvest   data on host individuals grown without Rhinanthus. Second, we grew   Rhinanthus on each of the grass species and related Rhinanthus final   biomass to the grass species' growth rates.   4. Rhinanthus performance was strongly correlated with the growth rate   of the host grass species, thus validating a key assumption of our   model. However, Rhinanthus biomass on three of the nine grass species   differed significantly from the value predicted based on host growth   rate alone, suggesting that grass species differ in their resistance to   parasitism.   5. Synthesis. Parameterizing such models of the host-parasite   relationship could help to explain variation in Rhinanthus performance   on different hosts, variation in the effects of hemiparasites in   grasslands of different productivity and differences in virulence among   parasite populations.",1987,MAYBE,CS,yes,,

The   objectives of the current study were to evaluate the effects of ASD   applied using composted poultry litter (CPL) and molasses as amendments,   on soil redox potential, pH, temperature, soil nutrient content, plant   biomass and nutrient accumulation, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. A   field study was conducted on fresh-market tomato (Solanum lycopersicum   L.) at two sites, Immokalee and Citra, FL, comparing ASD applied using a   mix of CPL at the rate of 22 Mg ha(-1) and two rates of molasses [13.9   (ASD1) and 27.7 m(3) ha(-1) (ASD2)] as a carbon-source to chemical soil   fumigation (CSF). ASD treatment had a significant impact on soil redox   potential, but did not affect soil pH or temperature. Soil treatment did   not affect nitrous oxide emissions from intact polyethylene mulched beds   at either location. Emissions ranged from 0 to 0.378 mu g m(-2) h(-1)   and from 8.8 to 39.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in Immokalee and Citra,   respectively.

In an agricultural soil, the amoebae are exposed to different   stress factors such as pesticides and weather conditions. The use of   pesticides increased up from 0.49 kg per hectare in 1961 to 2 kg in   2004, and the global greenhouse gas emission has grown 70 \% between   1970 and 2004 leading to a global fluctuation of average surface   temperature. Therefore, the European Directive 2009/128/EC has led to a   new approach to agriculture, with the transition from an old concept   based on high use of pesticides and fossil fuels to an agriculture aware   of biodiversity and health issues. We studied the effects of temperature   variations and pesticides on Dictyostelium discoideum. We measured the   fission rate, the ability to differentiate and the markers of stress   such as the activity and presence of pseudocholinesterase and the   presence of heat shock protein 70. Our results highlight how the   sensitivity to zinc, aluminium, silver, copper, cadmium, mercury,   diazinon and dicofol changes for a 2 A degrees C variation from   nothing/low to critical. Our work suggests considering, in future   regulations, about the use of pesticides as their toxic effect on   non-target organisms is strongly influenced by climate temperatures. In   addition, there is a need for a new consideration of the protozoa, which   takes into account recent researches about the presence in this   microorganism of classical neurotransmitters that, similar to those in   animals, make protozoa an innocent target of neurotoxic pesticides in   the battle against the pest crops.",1989,NO,CS,,,

Yet we understand   relatively little about the ecological role of parasites compared to the   role of free-living organisms. Bottom-up theory predicts that resource   enhancement will increase the abundance and biomass of free-living   organisms. Similarly, parasite abundance and biomass should increase in   an ecosystem with resource enhancement. We tested this hypothesis in a   landscape-level experiment in which salt marshes (60,000 m(2) each)   received elevated nutrient concentrations via flooding tidal waters for   11 yr to mimic eutrophication. Nutrient enrichment elevated the   densities of the talitrid amphipod, Orchestia grillus, and the density   and biomass of its trematode parasite, Levinseniella byrdi. Strikingly,   L. byrdi prevalence increased over time, up to 13 times higher in   nutrient-enriched marshes (30\%) relative to the mean prevalence in   reference marshes (2.4\%). The biomass density of infected amphipods   was, on average, 11 times higher in nutrient-enriched marshes (1.1   kg/ha) than in reference marshes (0.1 kg/ha), when pooling across all   years. Orchestia grillus biomass comprises 67\% of the arthropod   community biomass; thus, nutrient enrichment elicits a substantial surge   in parasitized biomass in the arthropod community. If our results are   typical, they suggest that eutrophication can increase parasite   abundance and biomass with chronic resource enhancement.

First, we performed genome   scans in four field populations that were sampled from different   continents and on distinct wheat cultivars to test which genomic regions   are under recent selection. Based on extended haplotype homozygosity and   composite likelihood ratio tests, we identified 384 and 81 selective   sweeps affecting 4\% and 0.5\% of the 35 Mb core genome, respectively.   We found differences both in the number and the position of selective   sweeps across the genome between populations. Using a XtX-based outlier   detection approach, we identified 51 extremely divergent genomic regions   between the allopatric populations, suggesting that divergent selection   led to locally adapted pathogen populations. We performed an outlier   detection analysis between two sympatric populations infecting two   different wheat cultivars to identify evidence for host-driven   selection. Selective sweep regions harboured genes that are likely to   play a role in successfully establishing host infections. We also   identified secondary metabolite gene clusters and an enrichment in genes   encoding transporter and protein localization functions.

Yet, area may affect not only species   diversity, but also the trophic structure of the local ecological   assemblage. In this context, recent theory on trophic island   biogeography offers two clear-cut predictions: that the slope of the   species-area relationship should increase with trophic rank, and that   food chain length (i.e. the number of trophic levels) should increase   with area. These predictions have rarely been verified in terrestrial   systems. To offer a stringent test of key theory, we focused on local   food chains consisting of trophic specialists: plants, lepidopteran   herbivores, and their primary and secondary parasitoids. For each of   these four trophic levels, we surveyed species richness across a set of   20 off-shore continental islands spanning a hundred-fold range in size.   We then tested three specific hypotheses: that species richness is   affected by island size, that the slope of the species-area curve is   related to trophic rank, and that such differences in slope translate   into variation in food chain length with island size. Consistent with   these predictions, estimates of the species-area slope steepened from   plants through herbivores and primary parasitoids to secondary   parasitoids. As a result of the elevated sensitivity of top consumers to   island size, food chain length decreased from large to small islands.   Since island size did not detectably affect the ratio between   generalists and specialists among either herbivores (polyphages vs   oligophages) or parasitoids (idiobionts vs koinobionts), the patterns   observed seemed more reflective of changes in the overall number of   nodes and levels in local food webs than of changes in their linking   structure. Overall, our results support the trophic-level hypothesis of   island biogeography. Per extension, they suggest that landscape   modification may imperil food web integrity and vital biotic   interactions.",1992,NO,CS,,,

Parasitic plants are components of many habitats and have pronounced   effects on animal diversity; shaping distributions, influencing movement   patterns and boosting species richness. Many of these plants provide   fleshy fruit, nectar, foliar arthropods and secure nest sites, but the   relative influence of these nutritional and structural resources on   faunal species richness and community structure remains unclear.   2. To disentangle these factors and quantify the resources provided by   parasitic plants, we focused on the hemiparasitic shrub Exocarpos   strictus (Santalaceae). Twenty-eight Eucalyptus camaldulensis forest   plots were studied in the Gunbower-Koondrook forest in southeastern   Australia, comparing riparian forests with an Exocarpos-dominated   understorey with otherwise similar habitats with or without equivalent   cover of the non-parasitic Acacia dealbata. Analyses of avian richness   and incidence (overall and in six feeding guilds) were complemented by   explicit measures of resources in both shrub types; foliage density,   standing crop of fleshy fruit and foliar arthropod abundance and   biomass.   3. Avian species richness was c. 50\% greater and total incidences for   five guilds were significantly greater in forests with the parasitic   shrub, with no appreciable differences between the other two habitat   types. In addition to plentiful fleshy fruits, Exocarpos supported   abundant arthropods in their foliage - significantly higher in biomass   than for equivalent volumes of Acacia foliage. Exocarpos had a shorter   and denser structure, providing a greater range of microhabitats than   the more open growing Acacia.   4. Our results demonstrate that structural and nutritional resources   (both direct and indirect) provided by Exocarpos affect diversity and   community composition, with each set of resources affecting different   organismal groups. Rather than an exceptional system or an aberrant   result, we suggest the influence of Exocarpos on species richness   relates to their parasitic habit, supporting the hypothesis that   parasitic plants mobilize resources from their hosts and make them   available to a range of trophic levels.",1993,MAYBE,CS,yes,,

To   describe population trends of 13 large herbivore species in Lake Manyara   National Park (Tanzania) from 1959 to 2016 and to discover whether the   herbivore community structure changed, we used general additive models   and additional statistical methods to detect structural changes in the   time series. Population dynamics were non-linear and population growth   rates were not correlated with precipitation anomalies. Relatively steep   population declines of three megaherbivores occurred during the 1980s   and early 1990s, resulting in severe reductions in African elephant and   buffalo populations and the local extinction of black rhinoceros. These   declines coincided with reported peaks of illegal hunting of these   species and expansion of agriculture at the periphery of the park.   Population densities of elephant and buffalo seem to have stabilized in   recent times, yet have not recovered to previous densities. In contrast,   eight species (giraffe, zebra, waterbuck, wildebeest, warthog, impala,   bushbuck, and baboon) have apparently fared well (similar or higher   densities in most recent compared to first decade), despite having   undergone substantial fluctuations over the past 58 yr. Population   fluctuations in these species were likely caused by disease outbreaks,   heavy bush encroachment, and reduced competition with buffalo. Possibly,   declines in megaherbivore densities (mainly elephants) facilitated bush   encroachment. Albeit grazers are still dominating in the herbivore   community, the proportion of browsers is currently increasing, likely   encouraged by dense vegetation in the shrub layer in large parts of the   park. Overall, herbivore biomass density has declined by similar to 40\%   compared to the baseline estimate in the first decade of the time   series. Our analyses and ancillary information provide evidence that   this overall decline in the herbivore assemblage was triggered by   human-induced reductions in megaherbivore population densities during   the 1980s, either through excessive poaching, insularization of the   park, or both. Likely, this had cascading and interacting effects on the   vegetation structure and the herbivore assemblage.

As an anthropogenic landscape, they require   specific measures to address preservation or to guide their evolutionary   trend. In the Northern Apennines, a landscape multiscalar-multitemporal   approach was adopted to highlight factors that have acted on the   evolution of this habitat and which still might affect either its   preservation or its evolutionary dynamics. Using a diachronic   GIS-approach, we analyzed old cadastral maps (drawn up 200 years ago),   and aerial photographs. Both the present distribution pattern of the   woody species and the incidence of important chestnut diseases were also   surveyed. The factors explaining the current extent and species   composition of the local chestnut forests confirm their status as an   anthropogenic habitat. The present landscape distribution of chestnut   woods is heavily linked to past human settlements. Chestnut blight and   ink disease are more an indirect reason for past felling activities than   an actual direct cause of damage to trees, because of the hypovirulence   spread and the limited incidence of the ink disease.

However,   measuring the impact of viral infection on PSII function in E. huxleyi   populations from natural, taxonomically diverse phytoplankton   communities is difficult, and whether this phenomenon occurs in nature   is presently unknown. Here, chlorophyll fluorescence analysis was used   to assess changes in PSII efficiency throughout an E. huxleyi bloom   during a mesocosm experiment off the coast of Norway. Specifically, we   aimed to determine whether a measurable suppression of the efficiency of   PSII photochemistry could be observed due to viral infection of the   natural E. huxleyi populations. During the major infection period prior   to bloom collapse, there was a significant reduction in PSII efficiency   with an average decrease in maximum PSII photochemical efficiency   (F-v/F-m) of 17\% and a corresponding 75\% increase in maximum PSII   effective absorption cross-section (sigma(PSII)); this was concurrent   with a significant decrease in E. huxleyi growth rates and an increase   in E. huxleyi virus (EhV) production. As E. huxleyi populations   dominated the phytoplankton community and potentially contributed up to   100\% of the chlorophyll a pool, we believe that the variable   chlorophyll fluorescence signal measured during this period was derived   predominantly from E. huxleyi and, thus, reflects changes occurring   within E. huxleyi cells.

Addition of organic and inorganic nutrients led to   the proliferation of high nucleic acid content bacterial cells   accompanied by high bacterial growth efficiency (considered as proxy of   bacterial carbon metabolism) estimates, suggesting that this subgroup   represented the most active fraction of bacterial community and had a   high capacity to incorporate carbon into its biomass. However, their   rapid growth induced the pressure of viral lytic infection which led to   their lysis toward the end of the experiment. In microcosms with   flagellates plus viruses, and with viruses alone, the selective removal   of metabolically active high nucleic acid cells through viral lysis   benefitted the less active low nucleic acid content cells, perhaps via   the use of lysis products for its growth and survival. Changes in   bacterial physiological state in microcosms were reflected in their   community structure which was examined using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)   gene sequencing by Illumina's Miseq platform.

In aquatic systems, many taxa consume   free-living stages of parasites, and can thus reduce parasite   transmission to hosts. However, the importance of the functional and   numerical responses of parasite predators to disease dynamics is not   well understood. We collected host-parasite-predator cooccurrence data   from the field, and then experimentally manipulated predator abundance,   parasite abundance, and the presence of alternative prey to determine   the consequences for parasite transmission. The parasite predator of   interest was a ubiquitous symbiotic oligochaete of mollusks,   Chaetogaster limnaei limnaei, which inhabits host shells and consumes   larval trematode parasites. Predators exhibited a rapid numerical   response, where predator populations increased or decreased by as much   as 60\% in just 5days, depending on the parasite:predator ratio.   Furthermore, snail infection decreased substantially with increasing   parasite predator densities, where the highest predator densities   reduced infection by up to 89\%. Predators of parasites can play an   important role in regulating parasite transmission, even when infection   risk is high, and especially when predators can rapidly respond   numerically to resource pulses.

We tested the prediction that   loss of a host species could affect the structure of a generalist   parasite community by investigating the role of endangered Light-footed   Clapper Rails (Rallus longirostris levipes) in structuring trematode   communities in four tidal wetlands in southern California, USA   (Carpinteria Salt Marsh, Mugu Lagoon) and Mexico (Estero de Punta Banda,   Bahia Falsa-San Quintin). We used larval trematode parasites in first   intermediate host snails (Cerithidea californica) as windows into the   adult trematodes that parasitize Clapper Rails. Within and among   wetlands, we found positive associations between Clapper Rails and four   trematode species, particularly in the vegetated marsh habitat where   Clapper Rails typically occur.

In particular, trait variation among   colonizing individuals can produce intraspecific priority effects   (IPEs), where early arrivers of a single species affect the   establishment or growth of later conspecifics. While we have some   evidence for the importance of IPEs, we lack a general understanding of   factors affecting their presence or magnitude across a landscape.   Specifically, IPEs should depend strongly on success of colonizers in   the new habitat patch. This success hinges on interactions between   colonizer traits and local selective pressures, but such context   dependence remains unexplored experimentally. We addressed this gap by   looking for the dynamical signature of IPEs in environments with and   without a selective (parasite) pressure. We tested whether IPEs affected   the population dynamics of a zooplankton host species (Daphnia   dentifera) collected from two populations showing a tradeoff between   growth rate and resistance to a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia   bicuspidata). Differences in arrival order significantly altered   population growth during a period of rapid resource depletion, driving   large (up to 65\%) differences in population abundance. Furthermore, the   presence of IPEs was context dependent, as parasites reduced the impact   of early arrivers on later arrivers. Such context-dependent IPEs,   mediated by colonizer traits, colonization order, and selective   pressures, may play an unanticipated role in the ecological and   evolutionary dynamics of natural metapopulations.

Cirsium dissectum (meadow thistle) is a perennial, rhizomatous herb   found in moist, nutrient poor grasslands and heathlands in north-west   Europe. It is readily distinguishable from other Cirsium species in the   British Isles but has been considered a subspecies of C. tuberosum,   along with C. filipendulum, in some other areas of Europe.   3. It is susceptible to being out-competed by species that are able to   increase biomass more rapidly. At more productive sites, greater   nutrient availability increases the proportion of rosettes that flower,   as well as rosette turnover. Seeds germinate readily under a range of   conditions in the growth room and greenhouse but seedlings are very   rarely found in the field. An examination of its population dynamics   reveals that clonal propagation is the dominant form of reproduction,   with the low number of seedlings primarily caused by very low   establishment rates in vegetation stands.   4. Cirsium dissectum is relatively tolerant of drought and shade even   though it is found in moist grasslands. At very low pH it suffers from   ammonium and aluminium toxicity. As it has suffered habitat loss through   drainage and succession, C. dissectum has declined in the British Isles   and it is now endangered in Germany and the Netherlands.",2011,NO,CS,,,

At the base of the coral-BBD microbial   mat, conditions were hypoxic or anoxic depending on light intensity   exposure. In contrast, CP mats did not exhibit strong microchemical   stratification with mostly supersaturated oxygen conditions throughout   the mats at all light intensities and with levels of pH generally higher   than in BBD. Two of three replicate CP mats were devoid of sulphide,   while the third replicate showed only low levels of sulphide (up to 42   mu M) present in darkness and at intermediate light levels.

We observed a decrease in radial growth before death in   ca. 84\% of the mortality events. The extent and duration of these   reductions were highly variable (1-100 years in 96\% of events) due to   the complex interactions among study species and the source(s) of   mortality. Strong and long-lasting declines were found for gymnosperms,   shade-and drought-tolerant species, and trees that died from   competition. Angiosperms and trees that died due to biotic attacks   (especially bark-beetles) typically showed relatively small and   short-term growth reductions. Our analysis did not highlight any   universal trade-off between early growth and tree longevity within a   species, although this result may also reflect high variability in   sampling design among sites. The intersite and interspecific variability   in growth patterns before mortality provides valuable information on the   nature of the mortality process, which is consistent with our   understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to mortality.   Abrupt changes in growth immediately before death can be associated with   generalized hydraulic failure and/or bark-beetle attack, while long-term   decrease in growth may be associated with a gradual decline in hydraulic   performance coupled with depletion in carbon reserves.

In deep-sea fishes, the prevalence of parasitism remains   poorly understood. Knowledge of ectoparasitism, in particular, is   limited because collection methods often cause dislodgment of   ectoparasites from their hosts. High-definition video collected during   43 remotely operated vehicle surveys (2013-2014) provided the   opportunity to examine ectoparasitism on fishes across habitats (open   slope, canyon, seamount, cold seep) and depths (494-4689 m) off the   northeastern U.S., while providing high-resolution images and valuable   observations of fish behavior. Only 9\% (n = 125 individuals) of all   observed fishes (25 species) were confirmed with ectoparasites, but   higher percentages (similar to 33\%) were observed for some of the most   abundant fish species (e.g., Antimora rostrata). Ectoparasites included   two copepod families (Lernaeopodidae, Sphyriidae) that infected four   host species, two isopod families (Cymothoidae, Aegidae) that infected   three host species, and one isopod family (Gnathiidae) that infected 19   host species. Hyperparasitism was also observed. As host diversity   declined with depth, ectoparasite diversity declined; only gnathiids   were observed at depths down to 3260 m. Thus, gnathiids appear to be the   most successful group to infect a diversity of fishes across a broad   depth range in the deep sea. For three dominant fishes (A. rostrata,   Nezumia bairdii, Synaphobranchus spp.), the abundance and intensity of   ectoparasitism peaked in different depths and habitats depending on the   host species examined. Notably, gnathiid infections were most intense on   A. rostrata, particularly in submarine canyons, suggesting that these   habitats may increase ectoparasite infections. Although ectoparasitism   is often overlooked in deep-sea benthic communities, our results   demonstrate that it occurs widely across a variety of habitats, depths,   and locations and is a significant component of deep-sea biodiversity.

I added AC (1\% by mass) with or without native seed to   plots in three ex-arable fields dominated by non-native plants in the   Methow Valley, Washington, U.S.A. Six years after a single application,   AC plus native seed addition restored native plant dominance by   decreasing non-native abundance from 34 +/- 4\% to 14 +/- 2\%, and   increasing native abundance from 10 +/- 2\% to 42 +/- 8\%. Relative to   non-AC-treated soils, AC decreased the abundance of the bacterial   (16:0), fungal (18:1 omega 9c, 18:1 omega 6,9,12c), and mycorrhizal   (16:1 omega 5c) lipids that were associated with non-native-dominated   soils. This research suggests that AC effects on plant growth might be   due to a complex combination of its direct effects on heterotrophic,   symbiotic, and pathogenic soil organisms as well as its ability to   sequester allelochemicals. This research showed that soil manipulations   may be a necessary component of native plant restoration because seed   addition alone did not restore native plant dominance, but AC plus seed   treatment did restore native plant dominance.",2018,NO,CS,,,

We compared   restored, California native perennial hedgerows to unenhanced field   edges consisting of commonly occurring semi-managed, non-native weeds.   Pest and natural enemy communities were assessed in both edge types and   into adjacent processing tomato fields. Using sentinel pest eggs, pest   control was quantified, and pest pressure and crop damage was compared   between field types. Economically-important pests were fewer and   parasitoid wasps were more abundant in hedgerows than weedy crop edges.   There was no difference in predatory arthropod abundance between edge   types, but there was greater predator richness in hedgerow than weedy   edges. Predatory lady beetles were more abundant and aphids were lower   in fields with hedgerows, up to 200 m into fields, the maximum extent of   observations.

Stable isotope analysis is widely used in assessing the flow of energy   in ecological communities and thus is a potentially valuable tool in   understanding the cryptic trophic relationships mediated by parasites.   In an effort to assess the utility of stable isotope analysis in   understanding the role of parasites in complex coral-reef trophic   systems, we performed stable isotope analysis on three common Caribbean   reef fish hosts and two kinds of ectoparasitic isopods: temporarily   parasitic gnathiids (Gnathia marleyi) and permanently parasitic   cymothoids (Anilocra). To further track the transfer of fish-derived   carbon (energy) from parasites to parasite consumers, gnathiids from   host fish were also fed to captive Pederson shrimp (Ancylomenes   pedersoni) for at least 1 month. Parasitic isopods had delta C-13 and   delta N-15 values similar to their host, comparable with results from   the small number of other host-parasite studies that have employed   stable isotopes. Adult gnathiids were enriched in N-15 and depleted in   C-13 relative to juvenile gnathiids, providing insights into the   potential isotopic fractionation associated with blood-meal assimilation   and subsequent metamorphosis. Gnathiid-fed Pedersen shrimp also had   delta C-13 values consistent with their food source and enriched in N-15   as predicted due to trophic fractionation. These results further   indicate that stable isotopes can be an effective tool in deciphering   cryptic feeding relationships involving parasites and their consumers,   and the role of parasites and cleaners in carbon transfer in coral-reef   ecosystems specifically.

However, alien plant   species are not evenly distributed in the landscape. We studied which   factors determine the actual level of neophyte invasion in a landscape   with heterogeneous land-use and which habitats are the most infected.   Since neophyte species with different life-forms can respond differently   to the factors determining the invasion, species groups of annual,   herbaceous perennial and woody neophytes were also analyzed separately.   The study was conducted within the field site network of the Kiskun-LTER   program (Hungary), in 16 sites of 5 km x 5 km. Fifteen habitat, types   were distinguished belonging to five major land-use/land cover types   (agricultural land, abandoned agricultural land, tree plantation,   semi-natural grassland and semi-natural forest). Present and past   land-use, landscape composition and environmental variables were   included as factors with a potential impact on the level of invasion.   The most important factor determining invasion level was present habitat   type, followed by the past habitat type of the location and landscape   context. Tree plantations, agricultural habitats and recently abandoned   agricultural habitats had the highest level of invasion.   As expected, annual neophytes were most abundant in agricultural   habitats, while perennial herbaceous neophytes were most abundant in   old-fields and plantations, and woody neophytes in tree plantations.   Past agricultural land-use was reflected in the higher levels of   invasion of annuals and perennials, and past forestry practice resulted   in higher levels of invasion of woody neophytes. In a landscape with a   higher proportion of tree plantations, not only the tree plantations,   but primary woodland patches also showed higher levels of invasion by   woody neophyte species.   Our results indicate the importance of present and past land-use in   plant invasion and suggest that tree plantations are hot-spots of plant   invasion and threaten the remnants of semi-natural vegetation.

The introduction of oil palm puts pressure on natural   resources because it is often planted in cleared-cut land that   previously supported other crops or was forested. This has led to   environmental concerns which require attention. Hence it is important   that new plantations are managed in a sustainable way to reduce the   impact of oil palm cultivation on ecosystems whilst maximising yield and   productivity to farmers. The application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi   (AMF) technology is one option that can benefit both agronomic plant   health and ecosystems.

Under natural   conditions, Tephritid fruit fly parasitoids enjoy ample access to fallen   or damaged fruits and their saccharide-rich juices, and wasp fitness can   potentially benefit in multiple ways from access to these resources. In   this study, we compared the effect of fruit juice with other food   resources on multiple fitness parameters in parasitoids that commonly   forage on fallen, damaged fruits: the braconid Diachasmimorpha   longicaudata and figitid Aganaspis pelleranoi. Parasitoids were subject   to simple or combined diets of guava juice (Psidium guajava), honey and   pollen, and their effect on wasp longevity, ovarian dynamics and (body)   carbohydrate levels was assessed. For both species, adult longevity   proved lowest on simple diets of water, guava juice, or pollen, while   greatest longevity was attained on honey or combined diets. For D.   longicaudata, egg load did not differ between the various diets, while   A. pelleranoi egg load was higher for individuals that had access to   honey or pollen, but did not differ between newly emerged wasps and   those fed guava juice.

Partial consumption is typical of herbivores but is also common in   some marine microbenthic carnivores that feed on colonial organisms.   Associations between nudibranch molluscs and colonial hydroids have long   been assumed to be simple predator-prey relationships. Here we show that   while the aeolid nudibranch Cratena peregrina does prey directly on the   hydranths of Eudendrium racemosum, it is stimulated to feed when   hydranths have captured and are handling prey, thus ingesting recently   captured plankton along with the hydroid polyp such that plankton form   at least half of the nudibranch diet. The nudibranch is thus largely   planktivorous, facilitated by use of the hydroid for prey capture. At   the scale of the colony this combines predation with kleptoparasitism, a   type of competition that involves the theft of already-procured items to   form a feeding mode that does not fit into existing classifications,   which we term kleptopredation.

However, the residues of these compounds, particularly the   macrocyclic lactones, are excreted largely unmetabolised in faeces,   where they may have toxic effects on dung-colonising insects.   Impoverishment of the coprophagous beetle community impairs the process   of dung recycling and, as a result, may enhance the persistence of   dung-dwelling helminth parasitic stages. To test this possibility, a   large-scale field trial was conducted in south-west England. The   availability of infective parasite helminth larvae (L-3) was   investigated on the herbage around 240 artificial 1-kg dung pats that   had been constructed from the faeces of beef cattle with naturally   acquired strongyle infections. Herbage up to 15cm surrounding each pat   was sampled at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10weeks after deposition. Pats were   subject to enhanced, natural or no dung beetle colonisation and   uncontrolled or enhanced rainfall. Under uncontrolled rainfall   conditions, 2weeks after pat deposition, significantly more L-3 were   recovered from around pats that were exposed to beetle colonisation than   from pats that were not colonised. However, by week 8, significantly   fewer L-3 were recovered from around pats that were exposed to beetle   colonisation compared to uncolonised pats. Under conditions of enhanced   rainfall, pats yielded significantly more L-3 than under uncontrolled   rainfall conditions, and there were no differences in recovery from   herbage around pats with enhanced, natural or no beetle colonisation.   The data suggest that over the duration of a summer grazing season,   temperate habitat dung-colonising insect communities, which include   mainly small endocoprid dung beetles of the genus Aphodius, can reduce   the development and survival of livestock gastrointestinal parasites on   pastures, but that this can be overridden by the effect of high   rainfall.Synthesis and applications. The work demonstrates that   conservation of dung beetle populations in temperate climates is   important in livestock management, not only for their essential role in   dung degradation and nutrient cycling, but because their activity can   also reduce the survival and availability of gastrointestinal parasites   on pastures.

Looking for genes under positive selection in pathogens   has been a priority in efforts to investigate coevolution dynamics and   to develop vaccines or drugs. To elucidate the functions involved in   host specialization, here we aimed at identifying candidate sequences   that could have evolved under positive selection among closely related   pathogens specialized on different hosts. For this goal, we sequenced c.   17 000-32 000 ESTs from each of four Microbotryum species, which are   fungal pathogens responsible for anther smut disease on host plants in   the Caryophyllaceae. Forty-two of the 372 predicted orthologous genes   showed significant signal of positive selection, which represents a good   number of candidate genes for further investigation. Sequencing 16 of   these genes in 9 additional Microbotryum species confirmed that they   have indeed been rapidly evolving in the pathogen species specialized on   different hosts. The genes showing significant signals of positive   selection were putatively involved in nutrient uptake from the host,   secondary metabolite synthesis and secretion, respiration under   stressful conditions and stress response, hyphal growth and   differentiation, and regulation of expression by other genes. Many of   these genes had transmembrane domains and may therefore also be involved   in pathogen recognition by the host. Our approach thus revealed fruitful   and should be feasible for many non-model organisms for which candidate   genes for diversifying selection are needed.",2031,NO,CS,,,

Despite the broad recognition of   the importance of mycorrhizae for global carbon and nutrient cycling, we   do not know how soil and climate variables relate to the intensity of   colonization of plant roots by mycorrhizal fungi. Here we quantify the   global patterns of these relationships.   LocationGlobal.   MethodsData on plant root colonization intensities by the two dominant   types of mycorrhizal fungi world-wide, arbuscular (4887 plant species in   233 sites) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (125 plant species in 92 sites),   were compiled from published studies. Data for climatic and soil factors   were extracted from global datasets. For a given mycorrhizal type, we   calculated at each site the mean root colonization intensity by   mycorrhizal fungi across all potentially mycorrhizal plant species found   at the site, and subjected these data to generalized additive model   regression analysis with environmental factors as predictor variables.   ResultsWe show for the first time that at the global scale the intensity   of plant root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strongly   relates to warm-season temperature, frost periods and soil   carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and is highest at sites featuring continental   climates with mild summers and a high availability of soil nitrogen. In   contrast, the intensity of ectomycorrhizal infection in plant roots is   related to soil acidity, soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and seasonality   of precipitation, and is highest at sites with acidic soils and   relatively constant precipitation levels.   Main conclusionsWe provide the first quantitative global maps of   intensity of mycorrhizal colonization based on environmental drivers,   and suggest that environmental changes will affect distinct types of   mycorrhizae differently. Future analyses of the potential effects of   environmental change on global carbon and nutrient cycling via   mycorrhizal pathways will need to take into account the relationships   discovered in this study.",2032,NO,CS,,,

We conducted a 13-year study to examine the persistence of   amphibian populations at a geographically isolated restoration site in   western North Carolina. We created a complex of breeding sites that were   intended to buffer populations from environmental stressors and to   enhance population persistence. Our primary efforts involved monitoring   the use of 10 constructed and 10 reference ponds on site. We estimated   annual juvenile production of the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) and   spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) based on the number of larvae   in ponds at the initiation of metamorphosis. We documented changes in   adult breeding population size based on annual censuses of egg masses.   Most constructed and reference ponds failed to produce juveniles   annually between 1998 and 2006 as a result of stressors that included a   drought, outbreaks of a lethal pathogen (Ranavirus), and the widespread   occupancy of constructed ponds by fish. Despite numerous reproductive   failures, a few ponds produced juveniles annually at rates that allowed   wood frog and spotted salamander populations to persist at high levels.   Both species exhibited strong resistance to environmental stressors, and   none of six other pond-breeding amphibians that were monitored suffered   site-wide extinctions from 1996 to 2006. Our results provide evidence   that complex wetland designs may enhance the resistance and long-term   persistence of populations that have little or no connectivity to   neighboring populations.

However, such effects are largely unknown in   young soil in the initial stage of soil formation. We measured nematode   populations in an ongoing field experiment that was originally   established to investigate the effect of agricultural practices on the   early development of a Mollisol from parent material. Six field   management practices were included: natural fallow (NatF), alfalfa   (Alfa), and annual cropped fields without fertilization or crop residue   input (F0C0), with fertilization but no crop residue input (F1C0), with   fertilization and crop residue input (F1C1), and a parent material soil   (PM). No nematodes were found in PM, but 37 nematode genera were   identified after 8 years of soil development from PM. Management   practices influenced the abundance of soil nematodes. The abundance of   plant parasites was higher in Alfa than in NatF, and lowest in F0C0 and   F1C1. Bacterivores were most abundant in Alfa and F1C1. In the graph of   structure index vs. enrichment index, Alfa and F1C1 were located in   disturbed quadrant; F1C0 was located in degraded quadrant, and NatF and   F0C0 were located in maturing quadrant. The metabolic footprint of the   plant parasites was larger in NatF and Alfa than in F0C0. The metabolic   footprint of the bacterivores was larger in Alfa and F1C1 than in F0C0.   The bacterivores and predators-omnivores were positively related to SOC   in C flows. The management practices were clearly separated from each   other on partial RDA bioplot; soil nematode genera were strongly related   to soil properties, suggesting the soil nematode community was driven by   management practices mediated via soil properties in the early stage of   the Mollisol development.

The   objective of our study was to determine whether the presence of R.   aureum creates a unique soil microbiome and to investigate the   relationship between R. aureum and other plant species. Our study site   ranged from 1,800 to 2,600m above sea level on the northern slope of the   Changbai Mountain.

Elevation and microbial biomass were the main influencing   factors for plant community structure. Analysis of interspecific   relationships reveals that R. aureum is negatively associated with most   other dominant shrubs and herbs, suggesting interspecific competition.

These organisms are pioneer colonizers of submerged   litter derived from the terrestrial surroundings, and through their   activities, they mineralize litter carbon and nutrients and convert dead   organic matter into biomass, establishing the link between basal   resources and higher trophic levels. Likewise, soil macrofungi play a   key role in forest plant communities as litter and wood decomposers,   mycorrhizal symbionts or xyloparasites. High saprotrophic activity   determines their significance in providing access to nutrients for other   groups of organisms. Here, we address direct and indirect effects of   climate change on the community composition, growth, reproduction,   metabolism, and decomposing activity of aquatic hyphomycetes, and on the   growth, abundance, fruiting phenology, community structure and   distribution of terrestrial macromycetes, primarily ectomycorrhizal   fungi, but also saprotrophs. Evidence so far suggests that future global   climate change will affect aquatic hyphomycete activity and community   structure, with consequences for the functioning of woodland streams.   Similarly, macromycetes will experience changes in community structure,   and shifts in phenology and distribution. The individual responses of   ectomycorrhizal fungi to global changes are particularly difficult to   address because these fungi depend on host plants and cannot be   dissociated from them.

Parks in the urban core are often highly   fragmented, leading to rapid genetic differentiation of relatively   nonvagile species. However, a diverse array of green spaces may provide   dispersal corridors through grey urban infrastructure. I identify urban   landscape features that promote genetic connectivity in an urban   environment and compare the success of two different landscape   connectivity approaches at explaining gene flow. Gene flow was   associated with effective distances between populations that were   calculated based on per cent tree canopy cover using two different   approaches: (i) isolation by effective distance (IED) that calculates   the single best pathway to minimize passage through high-resistance   (i.e. low canopy cover) areas, and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR),   an implementation of circuit theory that identifies all low-resistance   paths through the landscape. IBR, but not IED, models were significantly   associated with three measures of gene flow (Nm from FST, BayesAss+ and   Migrate-n) after factoring out the influence of isolation by distance   using partial Mantel tests. Predicted corridors for gene flow between   city parks were largely narrow, linear parklands or vegetated spaces   that are not managed for wildlife, such as cemeteries and roadway   medians.

The few studies adopting   a broader view have revealed that these plants mediate a series of   direct and indirect competitive and facilitative effects on community   structure and ecosystem processes.   I summarize findings from the two best-studied systems: a set of   experimental and manipulative studies from northern Sweden and an   integrated research programme in southern Australia, both focusing on   the most abundant hemiparasite in the region -Bartsia alpina   (Orobanchaceae; Lamiales) and Amyema miquelii (Loranthaceae;   Santalales), respectively.   Despite broad-based differences between these regions, their vegetation   types and biotic constituents, rates of litter-fall, litter   decomposition, nutrient return and plant growth all increased near the   hemiparasites in both cases. This leads to changes in the abundance of   other plants and the increased species richness and total biomass   reflects an indirect form of facilitation.   In addition to reallocation of nutrients from host tissues, some of the   additional nutrients may be excreted by other organisms, such as   visiting pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores and members of   below-ground decomposer communities. Small-scale heterogeneity in   nutrient availability could provide a mechanistic process underlying the   role of parasitic plants as keystone resources.   Parasitic plants can be regarded as either malevolent predators   (Dracula) or charitable benefactors(Robin Hood), but may be better   described as Dryads (Greek deities associated with specific trees,   which, in addition to being reliant on their host for their wellbeing,   affect nearby trees and visiting animals, rendering the surrounding   stand a sacred grove).   Synthesis. The Dryad role may be applicable to a wide range of   facilitators, whereby indirect interactions with other organisms affect   both hosts and adjacent plants, augmenting direct plant-plant   interactions. However, while consistent with both case studies and   information from studies of other parasitic plants, this role may be   most apparent in low productivity systems. Addition, removal and animal   exclosure experiments are highlighted as useful approaches to quantify   the community-level influence of parasitic plants, in addition to   dedicated work on the below-ground influences of parasitic plants.",2040,YES,CS,no,review,

Plant diversity has profound effects on primary production. Plant   diversity has been shown to correlate with increased primary production   in nutrient-limited grassland ecosystems. This overyielding has been   attributed to vertical niche differentiation among species below-ground,   allowing for complementarity in resource capture. However, a rigorous   test of this longstanding hypothesis is lacking because roots of   different species could not be distinguished in diverse communities.   2. Here, we present the first application of a DNA-based technique that   quantifies species abundances in multispecies root samples. We were thus   able to compare root distributions in monocultures of two grasses and   two forbs with root distributions in four-species mixtures. In order to   investigate if vertical niche differentiation is driven by soil nutrient   depletion, the topsoil layer of the communities were either   nutrient-rich or -poor.   3. Immediately in the first year, 40\% more root biomass was produced in   mixtures than expected from the monocultures, together with significant   below-ground complementarity effects, probably preceding above-ground   overyielding. This below-ground overyielding appeared not to be the   result of vertical niche differentiation, as rooting depth of the   community tended to decrease, rather than increase in mixtures compared   to monocultures. Roots thus tended to clump in the very dense topsoil   layer rather than segregate over the whole profile in mixtures. The   below-ground overyielding was mainly driven by enhanced root investments   of one species, Anthoxanthum odoratum, in the densely rooted topsoil   layer without retarding the growth of the other species.   4. Synthesis. Conventional ecological mechanisms, such as competition   for nutrients, do not seem to be able to explain the increased root   investments of A. odoratum in mixtures compared to monocultures, with   apparently little effect on the root growth of the other species.   Instead, the observed root responses are consistent with   species-specific root recognition responses. From a community   perspective, the observed early below-ground overyielding may initiate   the recently reported increased soil organic matter, mineralization and   N availability and thus may ultimately be responsible for the higher   productivity at high plant species diversity.",2041,NO,CS,,,

Five months after planting, polycultures (versus monocultures) had   increased abundances of aphids (threefold), ants (3.2-fold) and   parasitoids (1.7-fold) owing to non-additive effects of genetic   diversity. The effect on aphids was direct, as plant genetic diversity   did not mediate ant-aphid, parasitoid-aphid or ant-parasitoid   interactions. This increase in aphid abundance occurred even though   plant growth (and thus aphid resources) was not higher in polycultures.   The increase in ants and parasitoids was an indirect effect, due   entirely to higher aphid abundance. Ants reduced parasitoid abundance by   60 per cent, but did not affect aphid abundance or plant growth, and   these top-down effects were equivalent between monocultures and   polycultures. In summary, intraspecific plant diversity did not increase   primary productivity, but nevertheless had strong effects across   multiple trophic levels, and effects on both herbivore mutualists and   enemies could be predicted entirely as an extension of plant-herbivore   interactions.",2042,NO,CS,,,

In a   quasi-natural experiment we examined long-term monitoring data on   different components of the Serengeti Mara Ecosystem to trace the   effects of disturbances and thus to elucidate cause-and-effect   connections between them. The long-term data illustrated the role of   food limitation in population regulation in mammals, particularly in   migratory wildebeest and nonmigratory buffalo. Predation limited   populations of smaller resident ungulates and small carnivores. Abiotic   events, such as droughts and floods, created disturbances that affected   survivorship of ungulates and birds. Such disturbances showed feedbacks   between biotic and abiotic realms. Interactions between elephants and   their food allowed savanna and grassland communities to co-occur. With   increased woodland vegetation, predators' capture of prey increased.   Anthropogenic disturbances had direct (hunting) and indirect (transfer   of disease to wildlife) effects. Slow and rapid changes and multiple   ecosystem states became apparent only over several decades and involved   events at different spatial scales. Conservation efforts should   accommodate both infrequent and unpredictable events and long-term   trends. Management should plan on the time scale of those events and   should not aim to maintain the status quo. Systems can be   self-regulating through food availability and predator-prey   interactions; thus, culling may not be required. Ecosystems can occur in   multiple states; thus, there may be no a priori need to maintain one   natural state.

The foliar delta N-15 of two arbutoid plants (Orthilia secunda and   Pyrola asarifolia) were as enriched as ectomycorrhizal sporocarps,   likely indicating N transfer from mycorrhizal networks. The depletion of   foliar d(15)N by ectomycorrhizal and ericoid plants on poorer sites   likely reflected a high degree of N retention and photosynthate demand   by fungi, whereas arbuscular plants may have had a less significant   delta N-15 response because of a more passive role by fungi in   scavenging organic N. The results suggest differences in how mycorrhiza   exploit diverse soil N supplies ( recalcitrant and labile organic N,   NH4+, NO3-, and parasitized N) could be an important factor in boreal   plant community composition.",2046,NO,CS,,,

Location High-elevation forests in south-west Montana, central Idaho,   eastern and western Oregon, USA.   Methods Stand inventory and dendroecological methods were used to assess   stand structure and composition and to reconstruct forest history at   sixty 0.1-ha plots. Patterns of blister rust infection and mountain pine   beetle-caused mortality in whitebark pine trees were examined using   nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and   Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample tests. Stepwise regression was used to   build models of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-related   mortality rates based on a suite of biophysical site variables.   Results Occurrence of blister rust infections was significantly   different among the mountain ranges, with a general gradient of   decreasing blister rust occurrence from east to west. Evidence of   mountain pine beetle-caused mortality was identified on 83\% of all dead   whitebark pine trees and was relatively homogenous across the study   area. Blister rust infected trees of all ages and sizes uniformly, while   mountain pine beetles infested older, larger trees at all sites.   Stepwise regressions explained 64\% and 58\% of the variance in blister   rust infection and beetle-caused mortality, respectively, indicating   that these processes are strongly influenced by the biophysical   environment. More open stand structures produced by beetle outbreaks may   increase the exposure of surviving whitebark pine trees to blister rust   infection.   Main conclusions Variability in the patterns of blister rust infection   and mountain pine beetle-caused mortality elucidated the fundamental   dynamics of these disturbance agents and suggests that the effects of   climate change will be complex in whitebark pine communities and vary   across the species' range. Interactions between blister rust and beetle   outbreaks may accelerate declines or facilitate the rise of rust   resistance in whitebark pine depending on forest conditions at the time   of the outbreak.",2047,MAYBE,CS,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,"How does the biophysical environment (e.g., slope, aspect, climate, community composition, forest size and age structure) and disturbance history influence blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-caused mortality in whitebark pine communities"

In European   heathland, traditional land use created such dynamic systems favourable   for both early and later successional species. Little empirical evidence   is, however, available on the impact of current management on   metapopulations occurring in such landscapes. This paper looks at the   metapopulation viability of the endangered holoparasite Cuscuta   epithymum, a species that typically occurs in early successional stages   of recently managed heathlands. We used both observational and   experimental data from a 4-yr study to parameterise a spatially explicit   metapopulation model. This model explores the impact of demographic   characteristics and spatiotemporal landscape patterns created by   management events on metapopulation viability. Both occasional   long-distance dispersal and dormant seeds are shown to be critical for   the long-term survival of C. epithymum in a dynamic heathland landscape   subjected to a fixed rotational mowing of 15 yr. A relatively high   management frequency (< 15 yr between two consecutive mowing events)   appeared to be necessary to sustain a viable C. epithymum   metapopulation. When there is a longer interval between management   events, grazing can counterbalance the negative effects of vegetation   succession. Our results indicate that small-scale cyclical management   events combined with extensive grazing are the most appropriate   management strategy to maintain viable populations of C. epithymum   instead of the current large-scale management events. Our results   further emphasise the importance of incorporating both spatiotemporal   patch availability and key demographic characteristics, especially seed   banks, for a realistic view of metapopulation dynamics in disturbed   landscapes. This study clearly demonstrates the usefulness of   metapopulation models to understand the impact of management events and   to provide new ecological insights into processes acting at a landscape   scale.",2048,NO,CS,,,

We report the first metagenomic study of RNA viruses in an Antarctic   lake (Lake Limnopolar, Livingston Island). Similar to low-latitude   aquatic environments, this lake harbours an RNA virome dominated by   positive single-strand RNA viruses from the order Picornavirales   probably infecting micro-organisms. Antarctic picorna-like virus 1   (APLV1), one of the most abundant viruses in the lake, does not   incorporate any mutation in the consensus sequence from 2006 to 2010 and   shows stable quasispecies with low-complexity indexes. By contrast,   APLV2-APLV3 are detected in the lake water exclusively in summer samples   and are major constituents of surrounding cyanobacterial mats. Their   quasispecies exhibit low complexity in cyanobacterial mat, but their   run-off-mediated transfer to the lake results in a remarkable increase   of complexity that may reflect the convergence of different viral   quasispecies from the catchment area or replication in a more diverse   host community.

Nectar is a crucial energy resource that strongly mediates the   interactions between plants and animal pollinators or plant defenders.   Previous research has shown that nectar is frequently colonized by   microorganisms, most commonly bacteria and yeasts, which can have a   strong impact on nectar chemistry. However, at present little is known   about the effects of microorganisms on the fitness of animals feeding on   nectar.   2. We used three nectar bacteria representing different metabolic groups   (Asaia sp., Lactococcus sp. and Rosenbergiella sp.) and the common   generalist aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Haliday; Hymenoptera:   Braconidae) to test the hypothesis that different nectar-dwelling   bacteria affect nectar consumption and insect longevity differently by   altering the chemistry of nectar.   3. Bacteria significantly affected nectar chemistry by altering its   acidity, sugar and amino acids composition/concentration and by adding   compounds synthesized by the microbes. Although inoculation with   bacteria did not affect nectar consumption, a significant difference in   insect longevity was observed. The impact on longevity was species   specific, with Lactococcus being beneficial and Asaia having a   detrimental effect.   4. Bacteria have a strong impact on nectar chemistry and changes in   nectar chemistry may not only influence the foraging behaviour of   flower-visiting animals and impact on plant fitness, but also influence   the fitness of nectar-consuming organisms. As effects were species   dependent, changes in nectar chemistry induced by different bacteria may   have contrasting effects on the interactions between plants and insects.   It is therefore essential to know how different microbes alter nectar   chemistry to understand the relationships between plants,   nectar-inhabiting microbes and nectar-consuming animals.",2051,NO,CS,,,

Freshwater communities are subject to various abrupt environmental   disturbances and increasing pollution levels in their habitat. According   to the nature and the periodicity of disturbances (i.e. punctuated,   recurrent or continuous), one may expect different kinds of response of   the target gastropod communities.   2. The gastropod community of a French lake has been investigated for 10   years to study its responses to three main environmental disturbances:   supra-seasonal droughts, recurrent proliferations of cyanobacteria and   parasitism by trematodes. The relationship between this latter factor,   considered as a continuous stressor, and the gastropod community was a   particular focus.   3. A total of 13 280 gastropods belonging to 17 species (mostly   Pulmonata with Planorbidae as the dominant family) have been sampled in   the lake over the 10-year time series. Species composition of the   gastropod community varied strongly during the study period as did   species richness (0-14, mean of 6.5 +/- 0.4 species) and abundance of   gastropods (0-4456, mean of 192 +/- 72 individuals). Trematode larvae   belonging to 11 morphotypes of cercariae were detected in 15 of the 17   species of gastropods and had a total prevalence of 2.9\%.   4. Droughts (punctuated stressor) were responsible for the disappearance   of nearly all gastropod species, and thus represent a severe   environmental stressor for them. Nevertheless, the extent of this   stressor was limited since the gastropod community was highly resilient.   5. Recurrent proliferations of toxic cyanobacteria (recurrent stressor)   coincided with the large decline of the gastropod community,   corresponding to a strong decrease in abundance and species richness.   Intoxication of gastropods by toxic cyanobacteria was demonstrated by   the bioaccumulation of microcystins in all gastropod tissues.   6. Trematode parasitism (continuous stressor) did not affect the   gastropod community despite the possibly strong impact of parasites on   some host species (those with monthly prevalence as high as 100\% at   some times). Indeed, abundance and species richness of gastropods were   scarcely influenced by trematode prevalence or species richness.",2053,NO,CS,,,

Adult males and juveniles visited flowers more frequently than adult   females. Adult males may have visited flowers to feed on nectar and   offset the energy demands of advertising, lek defence and mating, and/or   reduced foraging time during summer. Juvenile bats may be under   increased energetic burdens due to naive foraging behaviour and use   nectar to augment low energy reserves. The frequency of visits   correlated positively with mean night ambient temperature, likely   because of increased prey, and therefore, bat activity.

Perennial bioenergy systems, such as switchgrass and restored   prairies, are alternatives to commonly used annual monocultures such as   maize. Perennial systems require lower chemical input, provide greater   ecosystem services such as carbon storage, greenhouse gas mitigation and   support greater biodiversity of beneficial insects. However, biomass   harvest will be necessary in managing these perennial systems for   bioenergy production, and it is unclear how repeated harvesting might   affect ecosystem services.   2. In this study, we examined how repeated production-scale harvesting   of diverse perennial grasslands influences vegetation structure, natural   enemy communities (arthropod predators and parasitoids), and natural   biocontrol services in two states (Wisconsin and Michigan, USA) over   multiple years.   3. We found that repeated biomass harvest reduced litter biomass and   increased bare ground cover. Some natural enemy groups, such as   ground-dwelling arthropods, decreased in abundance with harvest, whereas   others such as foliar-dwelling arthropods increased in abundance. The   disparity in responses is likely due to how different taxonomic groups   utilize vegetation and differences in dispersal abilities.   4. At the community level, biomass harvest altered community   composition, increased total arthropod abundance and decreased evenness   but did not influence species richness, diversity or biocontrol   services. Harvest effects varied with time, diminishing in strength both   within the season (for total abundance and evenness), across seasons   (for evenness) or were consistent throughout the duration of the study   (for community composition). Greater functional redundancy and   compensatory responses of the different taxonomic groups may have   buffered against the potentially negative effects of harvest on   biocontrol services.   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that in the short-term,   repeated harvesting of perennial grasslands (when insect activity is   low) consistently altered vegetation structure but had mixed effects on   natural enemy communities and no discernible effects on biocontrol   services. However, the long-term effects of repeated harvesting on   vegetation structure, natural enemies and other arthropod-derived   ecosystem services such as pollination and decomposition remain largely   unknown.",2055,NO,CS,,,

However, the ways in which complex food   webs respond to climate variations remain poorly understood. Here, we   use long-term time series to investigate the effects of temperature   variation on the intraguild-predation (IGP) system of Windermere (UK), a   lake where pike (Esox lucius, top predator) feed on small-sized perch   (Perca fluviatilis) but compete with large-sized perch for the same food   sources. Spectral analyses of time series reveal that pike recruitment   dynamics are temperature controlled. In 1976, expansion of a   size-truncating perch pathogen into the lake severely impacted large   perch and favoured pike as the IGP-dominant species. This   pathogen-induced regime shift to a pike-dominated IGP apparently   triggered a temperature-controlled trophic cascade passing through pike   down to dissolved nutrients. In simple food chains, warming is predicted   to strengthen top-down control by accelerating metabolic rates in   ectothermic consumers, while pathogens of top consumers are predicted to   dampen this top-down control. In contrast, the local IGP structure in   Windermere made warming and pathogens synergistic in their top-down   effects on ecosystem functioning. More generally, our results point to   top predators as major mediators of community response to global change,   and show that size-selective agents (e.g. pathogens, fishers or hunters)   may change the topological architecture of food webs and alter whole   ecosystem sensitivity to climate variation.",2056,MAYBE,CS,yes,,

Furthermore, our ability to predict how species of concern will fare   when subjected to disturbances such as environmental contaminants or   toxicants is often based on woefully misleading comparisons of static   toxicity tests. Here we present an alternative approach that features a   simple mathematical model parameterized with life history data applied   to an assemblage of species that provide an important ecosystem service:   a suite of parasitoid wasps that provide biological control of   agricultural pests. Our results indicate that these parasitoid wasp   species have different population responses to toxic insult-that is, we   cannot predict how all four species will react to pesticide exposure   simply by extrapolating from the response of any one species.   Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of survivorship and reproduction   demonstrates that the life stage most sensitive to pesticide disturbance   varies among species.

We examined whether the growth   of the early successional species Jacobaea vulgaris in soil collected   from the field is related to the local variation in plant density of   this species. In a grassland restoration site, we selected eight 8 m x 8   m plots, four with high and four with low densities of J. vulgaris   plants. In 16 subplots in each plot we recorded the density and size of   J. vulgaris, and characteristics of the vegetation and the soil   chemistry. Soil collected from each subplot was used in a greenhouse   pot-experiment to study the growth of J. vulgaris, both in pure field   soil and in sterile soil inoculated with a small part of field soil.   In the field, flowering J. vulgaris plants were taller, the percentage   of rosette plants was higher and seed density was larger in High-than in   Low-density plots. In the pot experiment, J. vulgaris had a negative   plant-soil feedback, but biomass was also lower in soil collected from   High-than from Low-density plots, although only when growing in   inoculated soil. Regression analyses showed that J. vulgaris biomass of   plants growing in pure soil was related to soil nutrients, but also to   J. vulgaris density in the field.

Rabies virus is capable of infecting   a wide range of host species, but in many ecosystems, particular   variants circulate among only a limited range of potential host   populations. The Serengeti ecosystem (in northwestern Tanzania) supports   a complex community of wild carnivores that are threatened by generalist   pathogens that also circulate in domestic dog populations surrounding   the park boundaries. While the combined assemblage of host species   appears capable of permanently maintaining rabies in the ecosystem,   little is known about the patterns of circulation within and between   these host populations.

This adult   secretion-induced dispersal has been examined with a laboratory assay.   Hexanal, the predominant component of the adult secretion was identified   as a component of the alarm pheromone by evaluation of the adult bug's   response time and escape distance from the chemical source.   Physicochemical analyses with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that secretory   components differed between nymphs and adults, and also during adult   aging.

In adults, hexyl acetate was the   major component of secretions within 3 days of emerging, while the   amount of this ester decreased and those of hexanal, hexanoic acid, and   hexanal trimer increased with aging. The decomposition of hexyl acetate   into hexanal via 1-hexanol was attributed to the presence of esterases   and alcohol dehydrogenases specifically found in adult secretory glands.   In contrast, the formation of a hexanal trimer may be due to a   non-enzymatic reaction under acidic conditions.",2062,NO,CS,,,

It has been proposed   that rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), which decimated populations of   European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Spain, led to prey   switching by raptors towards red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa)   causing declines in their populations as a peculiar case of   hyperpredation.   We have reviewed field studies that disagree with estimates (based on   bag records) of recent increases of rabbit and partridge numbers in   Spain. Because of an increase in releases of farm-reared animals, there   is doubt about the use of bag records to accurately estimate population   trends in recent decades. We also provide new data and discuss some   analytical considerations related to the temporal and spatial scales   that might affect the interpretation of data. Finally, we discuss why   studies associated with raptor food habits, predator population dynamics   and predator distribution suggest that diet data are not sufficient to   link patterns and processes. Although we agree that the RHD outbreak has   markedly affected rabbit populations, which has indirectly affected many   other species in the Iberian Peninsula, we consider that hyperpredation   mediated by raptors has not been clearly demonstrated. In contrast,   endorsing the hypothesis of raptor-mediated hyperpredation without   sufficient proof may have conflictive consequences if we consider the   increased persecution of raptors in recent decades in Spain.",2063,NO,CS,,,

During a study of the effects of   variation in precipitation on B. tectorum demography in Colorado, USA,   we observed infection by U. bullata and recorded data on variation in   infection rates among treatments receiving different amounts of winter   precipitation. Over 3 years, increased winter precipitation was   correlated with a higher prevalence of infection by U. bullata.

Lack of fire increases stand density and promotes successional   replacement of seral dominant trees by late-successional, more   shade-tolerant species. These changes are thought to increase   competition for limited resources among trees and to increase   physiological stress of dominant, fire-adapted species. However, there   has been little effort to directly investigate effects of lack of fire   on the physiological status of old trees, especially in unlogged,   protected forests. At four remote sites in the Selway-Bitterroot region   of Idaho, we tested whether the physiological status of dominant   old-growth ponderosa pine trees in repeatedly burned stands (three to   four 20th-century wildfires at roughly historical fire frequency)   differs from trees in paired stands not burned for at least 70 years. We   hypothesized that trees in relatively unburned stands would exhibit   signs of physiological stress due to increased competition for resources   in higher-density stands. Needle chemistry and morphological variables,   fine root production, mycorrhizal infection rates, depth of soil water   resources, and recent basal area growth rates were measured as indictors   of competition-induced stress. Contrary to predictions, needle carbon   isotopic ratio (delta C-13) and fine root production, variables related   to water stress, were slightly higher in repeatedly burned stands driven   by site-specific responses, and there were no significant biological   differences between trees in repeatedly burned stands vs. stands   unburned for at least 70 years in the remaining variables. Our results   raise the possibility that dominant ponderosa pine trees in uneven-aged   forests may be more resilient to increased stand density associated with   the lack of fire than previously thought.

We ask whether co-occurring trees that   associate with different types of mycorrhizal fungi, which are   hypothesized to differ in terms of nutrient use and plant-soil   feedbacks, differ in sapling establishment densities and probability of   co-occurrence. Given that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees typically have   fungal structures that protect roots from pathogens whereas arbuscular   mycorrhizal (AM) trees do not, we hypothesized that ECM saplings would   be clustered around ECM trees, while AM saplings would be suppressed   near AM trees. Most previous studies have focused on seedlings, but here   we examine whether the spatial signal is evident in later life stages.   We measured the spatial associations of similar to 28,000 trees using   point pattern analysis in a 25-ha old-growth forest where ECM trees   comprised 72\% of total basal area and 42\% of the total stems, while AM   trees comprised the remainder. Supporting our hypothesis, AM saplings   were more inhibited by AM trees, while ECM saplings were more clustered   around ECM trees. The spatial patterns of AM and ECM trees on saplings   of the alternate mycorrhizal type were inhibited. To the extent that   similar types of feedbacks occur for other AM and ECM trees, our results   suggest that fundamental differences in the nature of local-scale biotic   interactions between trees and their fungal symbionts may influence   forest community assembly and ecosystem dynamics.",2067,NO,CS,,,

However,   only little is known about their composition in plant roots and the soil   of biomass plantations. The goal of this study was to analyze fungal   biodiversity in their belowground habitats and to gain information on   the strategies by which ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi form colonies. In a   2-year-old plantation, fungal communities in the soil and roots of three   different poplar genotypes (Populus 9 canescens, wildtype and two   transgenic lines with suppressed cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase   activity) were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing targeting the rDNA   internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS) region. The results were compared   with the dynamics of the root-associated ECM community studied by   morphotyping/Sanger sequencing in two subsequent years. Fungal species   and family richness in the soil were surprisingly high in this simple   plantation ecosystem, with 5944 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and   186 described fungal families. These findings indicate the importance   that fungal species are already available for colonization of plant   roots (2399 OTUs and 115 families). The transgenic modification of   poplar plants had no influence on fungal root or soil communities.   Fungal families and OTUs were more evenly distributed in the soil than   in roots, probably as a result of soil plowing before the establishment   of the plantation. Saprophytic, pathogenic, and endophytic fungi were   the dominating groups in soil, whereas ECMs were dominant in roots   (87\%). Arbuscular mycorrhizal diversity was higher in soil than in   roots. Species richness of the root-associated ECM community, which was   low compared with ECM fungi detected by 454 analyses, increased after 1   year. This increase was mainly caused by ECM fungal species already   traced in the preceding year in roots. This result supports the priority   concept that ECMs present on roots have a competitive advantage over   soil-localized ECM fungi.",2068,NO,CS,,,

Coral reefs, in   particular, are experiencing a worldwide decline because of disease and   bleaching, which have been exacerbated by rising seawater temperatures.   Yet, the ecological mechanisms behind most coral diseases remain   unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that a coral pathogen, Vibrio   coralliilyticus, uses chemotaxis and chemokinesis to target the mucus of   its coral host, Pocillopora damicornis. A primary driver of this   response is the host metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a key   element in the global sulfur cycle and a potent foraging cue throughout   the marine food web. Coral mucus is rich in DMSP, and we found that DMSP   alone elicits chemotactic responses of comparable intensity to whole   mucus. Furthermore, in heat-stressed coral fragments, DMSP   concentrations increased fivefold and the pathogen's chemotactic   response was correspondingly enhanced. Intriguingly, despite being a   rich source of carbon and sulfur, DMSP is not metabolized by the   pathogen, suggesting that it is used purely as an infochemical for host   location. These results reveal a new role for DMSP in coral disease,   demonstrate the importance of chemical signaling and swimming behavior   in the recruitment of pathogens to corals and highlight the impact of   increased seawater temperatures on disease pathways.",2069,NO,CS,,,

We investigated mating behavior and reproduction of diploid males   of the parasitoid wasp Cotesia vestalis ( C. plutellae), for which we   recently demonstrated CSD. We show that the behavior of diploid males of   C. vestalis is similar to that of haploid males, when measured as the   proportion of males that display wing fanning, and the proportion of   males that mount a female. Approximately 29\% of diploid males sired   daughters, showing their ability to produce viable sperm that can   fertilize eggs. Females mated to diploid males produced all-male   offspring more frequently (71\%) than females mated to haploid males   (27\%). Daughterproducing females that had mated to diploid males   produced more male-biased sex ratios than females mated to haploid   males. All daughters of diploid males were triploid and sterile. Three   triploid sons were also found among the offspring of diploid males. It   has been suggested that this scenario, that is, diploid males mating   with females and constraining them to the production of haploid sons,   has a large negative impact on population growth rate and secondary sex   ratio. Selection for adaptations to reduce diploid male production in   natural populations is therefore likely to be strong.

The cutthroat trout population has   subsequently declined since the introduction of non-native lake trout   (Salvelinus namaycush), and in response to effects of drought and   whirling disease (Myxobolus cerebralis). The trout population, duration   of spawning runs, and indices of bear use of spawning streams had   declined in some regions of the lake by 1997-2000. We initiated a 3-year   study in 2007 to assess whether numbers of spawning fish, black bears,   and grizzly bears within and alongside stream corridors had changed   since 1997-2000. We estimated numbers of grizzly bears and black bears   by first compiling encounter histories of individual bears visiting 48   hair-snag sites along 35 historically fished streams. We analyzed DNA   encounter histories with Pradel-recruitment and Jolly-Seber (POPAN)   capture-mark-recapture models. When compared to 1997-2000, the current   number of spawning cutthroat trout per stream and the number of streams   with cutthroat trout has decreased.

Additionally, the number of black bears decreased between 64\%   and 84\%. We also document an increased proportion of bears of both   species visiting front-country (i.e., near human development) streams.

The Caribbean,   in particular, has been noted as a hotspot for coral disease, and the   aptly named white syndromes have caused the decline of the dominant reef   building corals throughout their range. White band disease (WBD) has   been implicated in the dramatic loss of Acropora cervicornis and   Acropora palmata since the 1970s, resulting in both species being listed   as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of   Nature Red list. The causal agent of WBD remains unknown, although   recent studies based on challenge experiments with filtrate from   infected hosts concluded that the disease is probably caused by   bacteria. Here, we report an experiment using four different antibiotic   treatments, targeting different members of the disease-associated   microbial community. Two antibiotics, ampicillin and paromomycin,   arrested the disease completely, and by comparing with community shifts   brought about by treatments that did not arrest the disease, we have   identified the likely candidate causal agent or agents of WBD. Our   interpretation of the experimental treatments is that one or a   combination of up to three specific bacterial types, detected   consistently in diseased corals but not detectable in healthy corals,   are likely causal agents of WBD. In addition, a histophagous ciliate   (Philaster lucinda) identical to that found consistently in association   with white syndrome in Indo-Pacific acroporas was also consistently   detected in all WBD samples and absent in healthy coral. Treatment with   metronidazole reduced it to below detection limits, but did not arrest   the disease. However, the microscopic disease signs changed, suggesting   a secondary role in disease causation for this ciliate. In future   studies to identify a causal agent of WBD via tests of Henle-Koch's   postulates, it will be vital to experimentally control for populations   of the other potential pathogens identified in this study.",2072,NO,CS,,,

Our objective was to show how diverse systems   can be studied at the community level using higher taxa as biodiversity   surrogates, and re-sampling methods to allow comparisons. To illustrate   this we compared the abundance, richness, evenness and diversity of the   litter fauna in a pine-oak forest in central Mexico among seasons, sites   and collecting methods. We also assessed changes in the abundance of   trophic guilds and evaluated the relationships between community   parameters and litter attributes. With the direct search method we   observed differences in the rate of taxa accumulation between sites.   Bootstrap analysis showed that abundance varied significantly between   seasons and sampling methods, but not between sites. In contrast,   diversity and evenness were significantly higher at the managed than at   the non-managed site. Tree regression models show that abundance varied   mainly between seasons, whereas taxa richness was affected by litter   attributes (composition and moisture content). The abundance of trophic   guilds varied among methods and seasons, but overall we found that   parasitoids, predators and detrivores decreased under management.   Therefore, although our results suggest that management has positive   effects on the richness and diversity of litter fauna, the analysis of   trophic guilds revealed a contrasting story. Our results indicate that   functional groups and re-sampling methods may be used as tools for   describing community patterns in highly diverse systems. Also, the   higher taxa surrogacy could be seen as a preliminary approach when it is   not possible to identify the specimens at a low taxonomic level in a   reasonable period of time and in a context of limited financial   resources, but further studies are needed to test whether the results   are specific to a system or whether they are general with regards to   land management.

Marine organisms are a prolific source of natural products, many of   which have become the target of pharmacological investigations. As well   as being bioactive, these compounds can play an important role in the   survival of the organisms and potentially affect community structure.   Sessile invertebrates such as sponges, cnidarians, bryozoans and   tunicates, in particular, are an especially rich source of ecologically   relevant compounds. These organisms are typically softbodied and unable   to escape predators, and as such, they rely on chemical defence for   their persistence. These invertebrates are also frequently hosts for   microbial symbionts.   2. Marine microbes are a prolific source of bioactive natural products,   many of which can be allelopathic and prevent the growth of pathogens.   For sessile marine invertebrates, which often have both bioactive   natural products and microbial symbionts, it is logical to hypothesize   that microbial symbionts may produce the secondary metabolites.   3. While symbionts are often thought to be responsible for producing   bioactive natural products that play a role in host defence, relatively   few studies have experimentally demonstrated that symbiont-produced   compounds defend the hosts. One reason for this is the difficulty of   manipulating the host-symbiont relationship, which is often obligate for   one or both partners. Given the importance of natural products to marine   invertebrates for defence, the prevalence of symbiosis in the marine   environment and the diverse metabolic capabilities of micro-organisms,   symbiont-mediated host chemical defence may be more prevalent than   currently understood.   4. In this review, I document evidence supporting chemical defensive   symbioses in marine organisms, discuss commonalities and differences   among the diverse relationships, and provide future research directions.   Epibiont-produced defensive compounds would seem to result in the most   efficient manner of protection, as the compounds are most accessible to   the predators. By contrast, endosymbiont-produced compounds may need to   be transported to exposed tissues. Elucidating mechanisms to transport   symbiont-produced defensive compounds within the host will provide   greater insight into the breadth and complexity of host-symbiont   interactions. Another important unexplored issue is how the hosts are   able to tolerate symbiont-produced metabolites that are often eucaryotic   cell effectors. A greater understanding of defensive symbiosis will   result from detailed studies of the co-evolution of predator, host and   symbiont, and if or how predators can influence the production of   defensive metabolites.",2075,NO,CS,,,

The relationships between crop   biomass and nematode abundance or ecological indices were also tested.   Crop species richness had no significant effects on either total   abundance nematode, nematode abundance within each trophic group, or   nematode ecological indices.

Crop biomass significantly increased the abundances of total   nematodes, plant parasites and omnivores/predators, and decreased that   of fungivores. Furthermore, the responses of PPI (Maturity index of   plant-parasitic nematode), EI (Enrichment index), and SI (Structure   index) to crop biomass were positive, although CI (Channel index) was   negatively affected.

We used 10 tomato plants   per treatment plot set in a randomized block design.

Total weight and number of tomatoes, and aerial   plant biomass (excluding fruits) were significantly higher for the   compost treatments than those of the control. Also, compost treated   plants bore mature fruits, in average, 9 days earlier and presented   higher resistance to diseases than controls. The weight of tomatoes per   plant grown in C20 was significantly higher than that of C9, differences   that could be attributed to the lower salinity of compost C20 (C20 and   C9 electrical conductivities were 1.5 and 15 dS m(-1), respectively).   The increased yield and resistance to diseases on tomato plants by   addition of seaweed compost appear to be related to a complex number of   factors not yet fully understood. It seems, however, that a combination   of higher nutrient availability (mainly P) due to slight increases in pH   of the soil amended, together with increases in readily available K and   an improvement in soil physical conditions (increase in pore size and   probably amelioration of hydric conditions), may have been responsible   for the higher production of seaweed amended plots as compared to the   control.",2077,NO,CS,,,

Despite the recent attention to the distance decay relationship, there   is no consensus on how the relationship varies across organism groups,   geographic gradients and environments. We first conducted a quantitative   meta-analysis of 401 distance decay relationships across a wide range of   organisms, ecosystems and geographical gradients, and then united the   effects of categorical and continuous variables on the rate of distance   decay using a general linear model (GLM). As effect sizes we used the   similarity at one km distance (initial similarity) and the distance that   halves the similarity from its value at one km distance (halving   distance). Both the initial similarity and halving distance were   significantly affected by variables characterizing the spatial scale,   organism properties, study region and ecosystem concerned. The patterns   appear robust as the results of meta-analysis and GLM only differed in   marginal details. According to GLM with Akaike's information criterion,   the most parsimonious models explained 55.3 and 37.6\% of variance in   initial similarity and halving distance, respectively. Across large   scales, similarity was decreasing slightly faster at high latitudes than   at low latitudes, while small-scale turnover was higher at low   latitudes. We also found significant differences in initial similarity   among the realms, with terrestrial systems showing higher small-scale   beta diversity. The decrease in community similarity at large scales was   higher among organisms that are actively mobile than among passively   dispersed organisms. We conclude that regression of similarity against   distance unites several ecological phenomena such as dispersal   propensity and environmental structuring, and provides an effective   approach for gauging the spatial turnover across sites. We also found   that the patterns in beta-diversity are highly scale-dependent.",2078,NO,CS,,,

How can these   constraints be overcome?   Location   Czech Republic, Central Europe.   Methods   Sowing of Rhinanthus seeds in grasslands of different history, biotic   and abiotic properties accompanied by a variety of management practices.   Followed by consequent monitoring of establishment and population   dynamics and synthesis of relevant literature resources.   Results   Appropriate timing of seed sowing is needed for successful Rhinanthus   introduction. Rhinanthus seeds must be sown at latest in November to   break their dormancy (valid for Central European populations; might be   different e.g. in oceanic regions). Rhinanthus is able to establish a   viable population mainly in low- to moderately-productive grasslands   with biomass production below 500g center dot DW center dot m(-2). Its   establishment is difficult in grasslands of higher productivity due to   the effect of competition for light on the seedlings. Rhinanthus   requires grasslands with appropriate management including mowing and   removal of litter, if it accumulates. Otherwise, the litter layer   strongly suppresses seedling establishment. Litter removal can allow   establishment even in some productive communities such as stands of   Calamagrostis epigejos. However, early mowing (i.e. mowing conducted   before ripening of seeds) can lead to a strong decline or even local   eradication of the hemiparasitic annuals. Soil conditions on the site of   seed origin and the target site can play an important role, as indicated   by failures of establishment of Rhinanthus originating from slightly   acidic soils on sites with soil pH values around 8. Suitability of a   given site for Rhinanthus introduction can be estimated on the basis of   its species composition using the Beals index or less formal expert   knowledge of local floristic associations of Rhinanthus spp. In the case   of suitable conditions, sowing density of 200-500seeds center dot m(-2)   should be sufficient for Rhinanthus establishment.   Conclusion   Mowing or grazing, litter removal, proper timing of sowing, and use of   the seeds from local seed sources should considerably increase   probability of Rhinanthus successful introduction. However, stochastic   events like adverse weather conditions or damage through herbivory make   the prediction of introduction success difficult.",2079,NO,CS,,,

Due to the high   persistency of cadmium in soil, and high soil-to-plant transfer rates,   humans are exposed to cadmium through their diet causing potential   adverse health impacts. Future scenarios for cadmium emissions to soil   via agricultural applications of inorganic and organic fertilizers in   Denmark were defined. A simplified fate and speciation model allowed the   increase in soil cadmium concentration to be calculated for each   scenario. Human exposure was determined based on soil-crop   bioconcentration factors for cadmium and dietary intake rates of Danish   food crops. Updated dose-response functions linking lifetime cadmium   intake to the probability of developing cadmium-induced renal disease   and osteoporosis were applied. These impacts were converted into   monetary values by using the EU standard value of a life-year adjusted   for quality of life experience. Annualized cost per unit of phosphorus   and cadmium are presented, discounted and undiscounted, for comparison.   Application of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) and mineral   fertilizer produced the lowest external health costs, followed by the   fertilizer products wastewater sludge and pig manure.

Here, we investigate whether   the selective loss of large wildlife can also drive changes in immune   function of other consumer species.   2. Using a long-standing large-scale exclosure experiment in East   Africa, we investigated the effects of selective removal of large   wildlife on multiple measures of immune function in the dominant small   rodent in the system, the East African pouched mouse, Saccostomus   mearnsi.   3. We find support for a general increase in immune function in   landscapes where large wildlife has been removed, but with some   variation across immune parameters. These changes may be mediated in   part by increased pathogen pressure in plots where large wildlife has   been removed due to major increases in rodent density in such plots, but   other factors such as changes in food resources are also likely   involved.   4.

Both are threatened by   climate changes that are projected to have significant impacts on the   quantity and variability of rainfall and affect key ecosystem drivers   (e.g. fire regimes). This poses significant challenges to monitoring   programs designed to detect these impacts. Effective monitoring of the   impact of climate change on biodiversity (rather than individual   species) requires a cross-disciplinary, coordinated, focused and   integrated approach. Ideally, this should involve a multidisciplinary   team of specialists working to a common plan on the same set of plots.   The contributions of `citizen scientists' are potentially useful if well   managed. Biodiversity per se (across all kingdoms of life, and including   the levels of the gene, population and community) should be monitored,   especially key species interactions and processes. Forestcheck is an   example of such a program which has been applied in forests in   south-west Western Australia since 2001. In concert with measuring the   direct impact of climate change on biodiversity and the indirect impact   of factors that affect biodiversity (such as disease, invasive species,   fire regime and habitat removal), there is a need for a proactive focus   on creating, maintaining and monitoring resilience to climate change   impacts in ecosystems. It is also necessary to monitor the effectiveness   of management actions such as vegetation thinning, changes in fire   regimes, species translocations and revegetation of farmland to link   isolated protected areas in agricultural landscapes, remnant native   vegetation in rangelands and extensive protected areas.

Model processes include pathogen growth and spread through   consumption of host tissue, chemotactic attraction of undifferentiated   host amoebocytes to infections, and amoebocyte differentiation into   various cell types that attack the pathogen. Sensitivity analysis shows   that the spread rate of a single localized infection is determined   primarily by the pathogen's potential rate of host tissue consumption   and by the host's ability to replenish the pool of undifferentiated   amoebocytes and sustain a long-term response. The spatial localization   of immune responses creates potentially strong indirect interactions   between distant lesions, allowing new infections to grow rapidly while   host resources are concentrated at older, larger infections.

This process has   greatly improved crop performance and can allow farmers to produce   viable harvests in previously un-profitable circumstances. However,   there is growing evidence that domestication may impact species   interactions perhaps through the amplification of effects across spatial   scales and so have a pervasive influence on the functioning and   sustainability of agro-ecosystems. This can occur directly, through   unintentional alteration to crop traits that disrupt the host-finding   ability of natural enemies; or indirectly through alterations to   within-plant nutritional quality that impacts herbivore size and density   and then ramifies throughout food chains. At the field level, the low   variability in traits between individual plants means that particular   weed and invertebrate communities are associated with each crop type. At   the landscape level, the use of one or a few varieties across wide   spatial scales, planted and harvested relatively synchronously, further   reduces diversity. This process acting across multiple spatial scales   represents a considerable selection pressure that may result in   feedback-loops which favour the occurrence of particular traits within   the community (e.g. resistance to pesticides). In order to properly   balance the `pros and cons' of the widespread adoption of new varieties,   for the future, we must consider how particular traits influence   interactions within the wider ecological community, and how these   effects amplify across spatial scales. Here we argue that the process of   domestication (with the primary goal of yield increases) and the   widespread use of a few varieties has led to potentially detrimental   impacts on species interactions, and suggest possible strategies for   mitigating some of these negative impacts in the future.

Here, we quantified richness   of internal fungi in relation to litter nutrient and phenolic   concentrations, sampling season (spring or fall), and premature leaf   shedding due to low precipitation and infestation of bark beetles   (mainly Ips typographus and Ips duplicatus). The study was conducted in   37-year-old Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.)

Fifty-four species of sporulating   fungi were identified in 2,330 freshly fallen needles sampled during   2003-2005, including 45 species in MF and 31 in CF. The significantly   higher number of species in MF was likely related to moister conditions   at that site. Among isolated fungi, 22\% (12 species) were identified as   endophytes of Norway spruce in prior studies. During spring of 2005, we   found less than half the number of isolates and fungal species at each   forest site as compared to fall for the two prior years.

Premature shedding of needles was the most likely cause of this   decline because it shortened the time period for fungi to infect green   needles while on the tree. For all sites and sampling periods, richness   of internal fungi was strongly and positively related to the age of   freshly fallen litter (assessed using needle Ca concentration as a   needle age tracer) and was also negatively related to litter phenolic   concentration. Richness of internal fungi in freshly fallen litter may   be adversely affected by low soil moisture status, natural inhibitors   slowing fungal colonization (e.g., phenolics) and biotic (e.g., insect   infestation) and abiotic (e.g., drought) factors that shorten leaf life   span.",2090,NO,CS,,,

It has given rise to an   unprecedented need to understand the link between rapidly changing   environments, immunocompetence and wildlife health (the nascent field of   ecoimmunology). Increasing our knowledge of the ecoimmunology of   amphibians necessitates the development of reliable, field-applicable   methods of assessing immunocompetence in non-model species. The   phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) inflammation assay uses a lectin to elicit   localized inflammation that reflects an organism's capacity to mount an   immune response. Although extensively used in birds to assess responses   to environmental change, stress and disease, its application in   amphibians has been extremely limited. We developed, validated and   optimized a practical and effective phytohaemagglutinin inflammation   assay in phylogenetically distant amphibians and demonstrated its   suitability for use in a wide range of ecoimmunological studies. The   protocol was effective for all species tested and worked equally well   for both sexes and for adult and sub-adult animals. We determined that   using set-force-measuring instruments resulted in a `compression effect'   that countered the inflammatory response, reinforcing the need for   internal controls. We developed a novel method to determine peak   response times more accurately and thereby improve assay sensitivity.   Histological validation demonstrated considerable interspecies variation   in the robustness of amphibian immune defences. Importantly, we applied   the assay to a real-world scenario of varying environmental conditions   and proved that the assay effectively detected differences in immune   fitness between groups of animals exposed to ecologically meaningful   levels of density stress. This provided strong evidence that one cost of   metamorphic plasticity responses by tadpoles to increasing density is a   reduction in post-metamorphic immune fitness and that metamorphosis does   not prevent phenotypic carry-over of larval stress to the adult   phenotype. This assay provides an effective tool for understanding the   role of global environmental change in the amphibian extinction crisis.",2092,NO,CS,,,

The stream with tadpoles contained a diverse   assemblage (23 species) of larval anurans, and we identified five   species of glass frog (Centrolenidae) tadpoles that were patchily   distributed but commonly associated with leaf detritus and organic   sediments in pools. The latter reached total densities of 0-318 tadpoles   m(-2).   2. We experimentally excluded tadpoles from single-species leaf packs   incubated over a 40-day period in streams with and without frogs.

Similarly, there were no   significant differences in leaf pack bacterial biomass, microbial   respiration rates or macroinvertebrate abundance between treatments or   streams. Invertebrate assemblages on leaf packs were similar between   treatments (SIMI = 0.97) and streams (SIMI = 0.95) and were dominated by   larval Chironomidae, Simuliidae (Diptera) and larval Anchytarsus spp.   (Coleoptera).   4. In contrast to dramatic effects of grazing tadpoles on algal   communities observed previously, tadpoles had no major effects on   decomposition. While centrolenid tadpoles were common in the stream with   frogs, their patchy distribution in both experimental and natural leaf   packs suggests that their effects on detrital dynamics and microbes are   probably more localised than those of grazing tadpoles on algae.",2093,YES,CS,yes,,

These areas also tend to be heavily   impaired by eutrophication from nutrient over-enrichment which increases   the occurrence and severity of hypoxia and pH cycles. We used laboratory   experiments to investigate the effects of diel-cycling dissolved oxygen   (DO) and co-varying diel-cycling pH on infections of Perkinsus spp. and   hemocyte activity in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. Perkinsus   marinus is the protistan parasite that causes Dermo disease in oysters.   Severe diel-cycling DO increased the acquisition and progression of   Perkinsus infections during exposure, and had a legacy effect the next   year. Diel-cycling pH did not significantly affect infection dynamics   either on its own or in combination with diel-cycling DO. Diel-cycling   DO and pH both individually and in conjunction stimulated hemocyte   activity, although this stimulated activity may not be effective at   preventing Perkinsus infection. The magnitude of cycling conditions is   an important consideration when choosing restoration sites, as severe   cycling may hinder the re-establishment of oysters by creating areas   that serve as reservoirs for parasites that can infect nearby   populations.",2094,NO,CS,,,

AMF spore density and   species richness as well as the numbers of infective AMF propagules and   glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) were analyzed. Four areas had been   restored for 16, 12, 8 and 4years, and after being mined, reconstituted   and re-vegetated, the fifth was mined and reconstituted but not yet   re-vegetated, and the sixth had a native and undisturbed coastal forest   vegetation.

The number of infective propagules was significantly higher in the   dry than in wet season, except in the un-vegetated dune area, which had   less than 0 center dot 2propagulescm3 soil. AMF spore density and   especially GRSP contents changed little between the seasons. GRSP   contents were positively correlated to Al and Fe soil levels and were   highest in the restinga forest. In total, 29 AMF species were   identified, and glomoid and gigasporoid species predominated in all   areas. AMF species richness and viable propagules of AMF were lowest in   the un-vegetated dune area. Remarkably, higher species richness (28) was   found in the re-vegetated areas, compared with the forest area that had   only 10 species. The numbers of infective propagules tended to be also   lower in the forest than in the re-vegetated sites.

Little is known, however, about the demographics of   sponges on coral reefs, despite their abundance and the important   functions they perform (e.g., increased habitat complexity, water   filtration). We have monitored permanent plots on reefs off Key Largo,   Florida, USA, to study the demography of particularly important species,   the giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta. From 2000 to 2006,   population densities of X. muta significantly increased at sites on   Conch Reef by a mean of 46\% (range = 16-108\%) and oil Pickles Reef by   a mean of 33\%. In 2006, densities of X. muta oil Conch Reef ranged from   0.134 to 0.277 sponges/m(2), and mean sponge volume was 1488 cm(3)/m(2),   with the largest size class of sponges constituting 75\% of the total   Volume. Increased population density resulted from a significant   increase in the number of sponges in the smallest size class. Recruit   survival did not significantly change through time; however, a   significant. interaction between season and year oil recruitment   suggests that large recruitment pulses are driving population increases.   Mean yearly recruitment rates ranged from 0.011 to 0.025   recruits-m(-2).yr(-1), with pulses as high as 0.036 recruits/m(2).   To explore the demographic processes behind the population increase and   determine future population growth of X. muta under present reef   conditions, a stage-based matrix modeling approach was used. Variable   recruitment pulses and mortality events were hypothesized to be large   determinants of the demographic patterns observed for X. muta.   Elasticity and life table response analysis revealed that survival of   individuals in the largest size class has the greatest effect on   population growth. Projections indicate that populations of X. muta will   continue to increase under present conditions; however population growth   may be negatively affected by continued mortality of the largest   individuals from a recently described pathogenic syndrome.",2096,MAYBE,CS,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

However,   the potential contribution of PSFs to community dynamics in changing   forest ecosystems affected by global change drivers is still largely   unexplored. We measured the direction, strength and nature (biological   vs. chemical) of PSFs experienced by coexisting tree species in two   types of declining Quercus suber forests of southwestern Spain (open   woodland vs. closed forest) invaded by the exotic soil pathogen   Phytophthora cinnamomi. To test PSFs in a realistic community context,   we focused not only on individual PSFs (i.e., comparing the growth of a   tree species on conspecific vs. heterospecific soil) but also calculated   net-pairwise PSFs by comparing performance of coexisting tree species on   their own and each other's soils. We hypothesized that the decline and   death of Q. suber would alter the direction and strength of individual   and net-pairwise PSFs due to the associated changes in soil nutrients   and microbial communities, with implications for recruitment dynamics   and species coexistence. In support of our hypothesis, we found that the   decline of Q. suber translated into substantial alterations of   individual and net-pairwise PSFs, which shifted from mostly neutral to   significantly positive or negative, depending on the forest type. In   both cases however the identified PSFs benefited other species more than   Q. suber (i.e., heterospecific positive PSF in the open woodland,   conspecific negative PSF in the closed forest). Our results supported   PSFs driven by changes in chemical soil properties (mainly phosphorus)   and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but not in pathogen abundance.   Overall, our study suggests that PSFs might reinforce the loss of   dominance of Q. suber in declining forests invaded by P. cinnamomi by   promoting the relative performance of non-declining coexisting species.   More generally, our results indicate an increase in the strength of net   PSFs as natural forests become disturbed by global change drivers (e.g.,   invasive species), suggesting an increasingly important role of PSFs in   forest community dynamics in the near future.",2097,MAYBE,CS,yes,,

In kelp bed ecosystems, regime shifts occur when high   densities of sea urchins destructively graze kelp and create coralline   algal barrens. While the importance of predation and disease in   mediating shifts between kelp beds and barrens on shallow rocky reefs   has been well documented, little is known about the role of deep-living   urchins in these alternative stable-state dynamics. In this study, we   test the hypothesis that deep-living urchins along the central Atlantic   coast of Nova Scotia move onshore and trigger shifts from kelp beds to   barrens on shallow rocky reefs. We documented urchin distribution and   abundance using tow-camera surveys down to 140 m depth and spanning 140   km of coast and created a predictive species-distribution model using   these observations and spatial data on environmental factors that likely   delineate suitable habitat for urchins. We used a random forest model to   generate our predictions, which correctly classified 91\% of   observations into a positive or negative occurrence of urchins. Sea   urchins predominantly occurred within 1.5 km of shore, in depressions   and flat habitats between 40 and 85 m depth. We found that shallow   regions where destructive grazing fronts have been documented over the   past four decades were closer to deep-living sea urchin habitats   compared to regions that remained in a kelp bed state during the same   period. This supports our prediction that deep-living urchins play an   important role in driving shallow regime shift dynamics, and indicates   that their distribution can help identify areas of coast that are most   vulnerable to a collapse to barrens.",2098,NO,CS,,,

Evidence that disease   resistance is density-dependent is accumulating, but the exact form of   this relationship is highly variable from species to species. It has   been hypothesized that insects experiencing high population densities   might allocate more energy to disease resistance than those at lower   densities, because they are more likely to encounter density-dependent   pathogens. In contrast, the increased stress of high-density conditions   might leave insects more vulnerable to disease. Both scenarios have been   reported for various outbreak Lepidoptera in the literature. We tested   the relationship between larval density and disease resistance with the   gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and one of its most important   density-dependent mortality factors, the nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV)   LdMNPV, in a series of bioassays. Larvae were reared in groups at   different densities, fed the virus individually, and then reared   individually to evaluate response to infection. In this system,   resistance to the virus decreased with increasing larval density.   Similarly, time to death was faster at high densities than at lower   densities. Implications of density-resistance relationships for   insect-pathogen population dynamics were explored in a mathematical   model. In general, an inverse relationship between rearing density and   disease resistance has a stabilizing effect on population dynamics.",2099,NO,CS,,,

Endophytic fungi are associates of most species of plants and may   modify insect community structures through the production of toxic   alkaloids. Fertilization is known to increase food plant quality for   herbivores, but it is also conceivable that additional nitrogen could   increase the production of the insect toxic alkaloid, peramine, in   endophyte-infected plants.   2. The relative importance of soil fertility and endophyte infection on   herbivores and their natural enemies is unknown. As performance of the   host plant is often affected by an interaction between endophyte   infection and genetic background, four different plant cultivars were   tested. The main questions addressed in this study were whether plant   cultivar and fertilizer addition to endophyte-infected and   endophyte-free Lolium perenne affect alkaloid concentrations, plant   life-history traits and the abundances of aphid species and their   parasitoids.   3. In a full factorial outdoor experiment we found a strong positive   effect of fertilizer on plant biomass and on the abundance of aphids and   parasitoids. While plant traits differed between cultivars, there was   little effect of cultivar on either aphid or parasitoid abundance. Only   endophyte-infected plants contained alkaloids, and the concentration of   peramine was enhanced in fertilized plants. However, endophyte infection   had no negative effect on aphid or parasitoid abundances. Plant traits   were only weakly influenced by endophyte infection in the field, which   contrasts with plant growth room studies, where both germination rate   and plant height were influenced by endophyte-cultivar interactions.   4.

To test the efficacy of   some of these measures (creation of pastures, opening firebreaks) in   rabbit populations, two managed (M1 and M2) and two control areas (C1   and C2) were selected in the Portuguese Southwest (SW) Coast. In each   study area, the influence of habitat management was tested assessing   temporal changes in rabbit abundance obtained from pellet counts and in   rabbits' diet through microhistological analysis of fecal pellets.   Rabbit densities were higher in managed than in control areas (mean   annual values: M1-1.08 pellets/m(2); M2-1.60 pellets/m(2); C1-0.69   pellets/m(2); C2-0.40 pellets/m(2)).

In   control areas, consumption of alternative species with low nutritive   value (e.g., Cistus ladanifer) was observed, especially in summer. Our   data suggest a positive influence of habitat management on rabbit   populations since in managed areas individuals presented an overall   higher abundance and a more nutritive diet.

Vibrio numbers up to 3.4x 10(4)   cellsxmL(-1) (2.2\% of total microbial counts) were determined in   summer, but their abundance was significantly lower in winter (5x10(2)   cellsxmL(-1)). Correlations between Vibrio and nutrients (SiO2, PO43-,   DIN), Secchi depth, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a were   calculated using Spearman rank analysis. Multiple stepwise regression   analysis was carried out to analyze the additive influence of multiple   factors on Vibrio. Based on these calculations, we found that high water   temperature and low salinity best explained the increase of Vibrio cell   numbers. Other environmental parameters, especially nutrients and   chlorophyll a, also had an influence. All variables were shown to be   subject to the overall seasonal dynamics at Helgoland Roads.

Promoting ecosystem services, such as biological pest   control, could help to reduce pesticide inputs while simultaneously   sustaining a high productivity. The highly intensive rice production in   Southeast Asia, where more than 20\% of the world's rice yield is   produced, is challenged by devastating losses each year due to rice   hoppers. This poses a great threat to the more than 3.5 billion people   depending on rice as staple food. Egg parasitoids are among the most   important natural enemies of rice hoppers and might be promoted with   effective habitat management. However, empirical studies that focus on   the management of parasitoid populations to enhance biological pest   control in rice agroecosystems are largely lacking. We therefore   analysed the effects of the availability of diverse habitats on hopper   parasitoid performance, parasitism rates and pest control services,   hypothesising that egg parasitoid abundance and pest control is   positively influenced by diverse non-crop areas, which provide food   resources as well as retreat areas for the fallow season.   We experimentally tested the efficiency and abundance of egg parasitoids   of Nilaparvata lugens and Nephotettix spp. in three study sites   representing different levels of floral resources over the course of two   rice growing seasons. We used mixed effect models to test whether   habitat diversity positively influenced parasitoid abundance and   subsequently reduces hatching rates of the hopper nymphs.   Nephotettix spp. eggs were parasitized by Gonatocerus spp. and   Paracentrobia spp. by 92.5\%; Nilaparvata lugens eggs were parasitized   by Oligosita spp. and Anagrus spp by 93\%. In contrast to our   hypothesis, we could demonstrate that additional floral resources do not   significantly enhance parasitoid abundance and pest control in rice   agroecosystems. Up to six times more parasitoids hatched-from the bait   plants exposed in the monoculture compared to the non-crop areas (p <   0.05). All parasitoid genera except Anagrus spp. were found in rice   fields in triple or quadruple numbers compared to the non-crop habitats   (p < 0.05). This was true also during the fallow period (p < 0.05),   where only ratoon rice was available to sustain hopper populations.   In contrast to our hypotheses and findings from temperate productions   systems, we found higher parasitoid abundance during all crop stages and   increased hatching rates in the monocultures than in the non-crop   habitats. The structural and temporal heterogeneity of rice crops and   ratoon rice within the production area seemed to be sufficient to   sustain high densities of parasitoid populations. We conclude that   ecological intensification schemes should implement asynchronous   planting cycles in rice systems to maintain or enhance parasitoids   populations and their biocontrol services. In combination with reduced   pesticide inputs, these measures might help to avoid yield losses due to   rice hoppers in the future.",2103,NO,CS,,,

Theory suggests that a crucial factor determining the degree   of ecosystem stability is simply the degree of synchrony with which   different species in ecological food webs respond to environmental   stochasticity. Ecosystems in which all food-web pathways are affected   similarly by external disturbance should amplify variability in top   carnivore abundance over time due to population interactions, whereas   ecosystems in which a large fraction of pathways are nonresponsive or   even inversely responsive to external disturbance will have more   constant levels of abundance at upper trophic levels. To test the   mechanism underlying this hypothesis, we used over half a century of   demographic data for multiple species in the Serengeti (Tanzania)   ecosystem to measure the degree of synchrony to variation imposed by an   external environmental driver, the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).   ENSO effects were mediated largely via changes in dry-season vs.   wet-season rainfall and consequent changes in vegetation availability,   propagating via bottom-up effects to higher levels of the Serengeti food   web to influence herbivores, predators and parasites. Some species in   the Serengeti food web responded to the influence of ENSO in opposite   ways, whereas other species were insensitive to variation in ENSO.   Although far from conclusive, our results suggest that a diffuse mixture   of herbivore responses could help buffer top carnivores, such as   Serengeti lions, from variability in climate.

For example, if parasites acclimate   to temperature shifts faster than their hosts, as might be expected due   to their smaller sizes and faster metabolisms, temperature variability   could lead to increased infection. However, this assumption might not   hold if benefits of acclimation are counteracted by energetic costs or   thermal stress, underscoring the need for empirical efforts to assess   how temperature variability will influence host-parasite interactions.   We used an array of replicate incubators to test how temperature shifts   from five acclimation temperatures (13-25 degrees C) to five performance   temperatures (16-28 degrees C) influenced release of infective stages by   the trematode parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae from its snail intermediate   host (Helisoma trivolvis) at four time-points after a temperature shift.   Initially, parasite release was higher at warm temperatures and   increased temporarily after infected snails were shifted to higher   temperatures, particularly for hosts acclimated to cooler temperatures.   However, these effects were transient, such that parasite release at   warm temperatures declined steadily over the 7days following the shift.   Warmer temperatures also increased snail mortality.   Parasite release was strongly influenced not only by ambient temperature   but also by the thermal history of the host. Prior acclimation to warm   temperatures reduced parasite release at warm performance temperatures,   contrary to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. Rather, the observed   pattern was likely driven by: (i) energetic costs of prolonged exposure   to high temperatures (thermal stress') or (ii) parasites' capacity to   store' infectious stages at cooler temperatures.   The time-dependent nature of thermal effects on parasite performance   highlights the importance of considering the amplitude and frequency of   temperature variability for understanding future changes to disease   dynamics.",2105,NO,CS,,,

Introduction experiments offer a direct test of recruitment   limitation, but generally only the seed germination and seedling phases   are monitored. Thus the relative importance of different establishment   stages in the process of recruitment is not considered. This is   particularly true for parasitic plants where empirical data are   generally missing. During two consecutive growing seasons we examined   the effect of heathland management applications, degree of heathland   Succession (pioneer, building and mature phase) and seed-density on the   recruitment and establishment of the endangered holoparasite Cuscuta   epithymum. In general, recruitment after two growing seasons was low   with 4.79\% of the sown seeds that successfully emerged to the seedling   stage and a final establishment of 89 flowering adults (i.e. <1.5\% of   the sown seeds). Although a higher seed-density resulted in a higher   number of seedlings, seed-density did not significantly affected   relative germination percentages. The management type and subsequent   heath succession had no significant effect on seedling emergence:   whereas, seedling attachment to the host, establishment and growth to   full-grown size were hampered in older heath vegetation (i.e. high,   dense, and mature canopy). Establishment was most successful in turf-cut   pioneer heathland, characterised by a relatively open and low vegetation   of young Calluna vulgaris. The age of C. vulgaris, C. epithymum's main   host, proved to be the most limiting factor. These results emphasise the   importance of site quality (i.e. successional phase of its host) on   recruitment success of C epithymum, which is directly affected by the   management applied to the vegetation. Lack of any heathland management   will thus seriously restrict establishment of the endangered parasite.   (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",2106,NO,CS,,,

Interspecific competition is often asymmetrical and the   smaller carnivore is usually affected the most. We investigated the   behavioural responses of two native species, the larger Tasmanian devil   (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the smaller spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus   maculatus) to each other's odour and to that of an introduced predator,   the feral cat (Felis catus), in north-west Tasmania, Australia. We used   an experimental array of camera traps, in which carnivore scats were   added as treatments. Behavioural responses exhibited by devils and   quolls are indicative of a dominant predator-mesopredator relationship   and suggest the potential for interspecific competition. The larger   predator, the devil, was as vigilant at quoll odour as at control camera   traps, but showed decreased vigilance at cat odour and did not avoid cat   or quoll odours. The smaller predator, the spotted-tailed quoll,   increased its vigilance near devil odour compared to control camera   traps but did not avoid it. This experiment shows that assessing the   behavioural responses of sympatric carnivores to each other's odour can   help understand predator interactions and reveal the potential for   interspecific competition. Understanding these interactions is crucial   in managing and conserving carnivores.   Animals navigate through an environment full of faecal odours left by   predators, competitors and conspecifics. These odours provide   information on both the immediate presence and the indirect risk of   encountering a predator or an aggressive competitor. Tasmania's largest   predator, the Tasmanian devil, coexists with the smaller spotted-tailed   quoll and the introduced feral cat. We tested the behavioural responses   of Tasmanian devils and spotted-tailed quolls to each other's faecal   odour and to cat faecal odour. Behavioural patterns exhibited by   predators in this experiment are indicative of a dominant   predator-mesopredator relationship and suggest the potential for   interspecific competition.

Yet insight into the impact of these sticky molecules on the   environmental transmission of pathogens in the ocean is limited. We used   the zoonotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii as a model to evaluate   polymer-mediated mechanisms that promote transmission of terrestrially   derived pathogens to marine fauna and humans. We show that transparent   exopolymer particles, a particulate form of EPS, enhance T. gondii   association with marine aggregates, material consumed by organisms   otherwise unable to access micrometre-sized particles. Adhesion to EPS   biofilms on macroalgae also captures T. gondii from the water, enabling   uptake of pathogens by invertebrates that feed on kelp surfaces. We   demonstrate the acquisition, concentration and retention of T. gondii by   kelp-grazing snails, which can transmit T. gondii to threatened   California sea otters. Results highlight novel mechanisms whereby   aquatic polymers facilitate incorporation of pathogens into food webs   via association with particle aggregates and biofilms.

We studied a host-antagonist system of cavity-nesting bees,   wasps and their antagonists and hypothesised that hosts and antagonists   show different responses to local land-use intensity, the diversity of   landscape in terms of composition and the spatial structure of landscape   in terms of configuration.   In a highly replicated study, we established nesting resources on 95   grasslands in three geographic regions across Germany and measured   species richness and abundance of hosts (bees and wasps) and their   antagonists, and rates of parasitism. For each site, we quantified local   land-use intensity as well as landscape heterogeneity in terms of   composition and configuration at spatial scales ranging from 250 m to   2000 m.   Increasing landscape heterogeneity enhanced species richness, abundance   and parasitism rate, whereas local land-use intensity only marginally   negatively affected total abundance. Bee and wasp abundance as well as   wasp species richness were enhanced by landscape composition at 250 m,   whereas their antagonists were enhanced by landscape configuration at   1500 m.   In conclusion, landscape composition and configuration affect trophic   levels differently and are more relevant than local land-use intensity.   Solitary bees and wasps, which offer important pollination and pest   control services, could be supported by enhancing landscape diversity,   while their antagonists could benefit from measures that promote   landscape connectivity. Hence, scale-dependent and trophic group   specific conservation management schemes are required, that address   different components of landscape heterogeneity to enhance functional   diversity and trophic interactions in agricultural landscapes.

Recent simulations show that tree shapes   also play an important role in determining the magnitude of PD loss,   potentially offsetting the effects of clustered extinctions. While   patterns of PD loss under different extinction scenarios are becoming   well characterized in model phylogenies, analyses of real clades that   often have unbalanced tree shapes remain scarce, particularly for marine   organisms. Here, we use a fossil-calibrated phylogeny of all living   scleractinian reef corals in conjunction with IUCN data on extinction   vulnerabilities to quantify how loss of species in different threat   categories will affect the PD of this group. Our analyses reveal that   predicted PD loss in corals varies substantially among different   threats, with extinctions due to bleaching and disease having the   largest negative effects on PD. In general, more phylogenetically   clustered extinctions lead to larger losses of PD in corals, but there   are notable exceptions; extinction of rare corals from distantly-related   old and unique lineages can also result in substantial PD loss.

However, the plant maternal genotype did influence   the P-max and shoot biomass of A. sibiricum.

Plant growth is a fundamental ecological process, integrating across   scales from physiology to community dynamics and ecosystem properties.   Recent improvements in plant growth modelling have allowed deeper   understanding and more accurate predictions for a wide range of   ecological issues, including competition among plants, plantherbivore   interactions and ecosystem functioning. 2. One challenge in modelling   plant growth is that, for a variety of reasons, relative growth rate   (RGR) almost universally decreases with increasing size, although   traditional calculations assume that RGR is constant. Nonlinear growth   models are flexible enough to account for varying growth rates. 3. We   demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for   modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate   function-derived growth rates, which allow unbiased comparisons among   species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty   in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting   nonlinear models can be challenging, so we present extensive worked   examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in R. 4. The use   of nonlinear models coupled with function-derived growth rates can   facilitate the testing of novel hypotheses in population and community   ecology. For example, the use of such techniques has allowed better   understanding of the components of RGR, the costs of rapid growth and   the linkage between host and parasite growth rates. We hope this   contribution will demystify nonlinear modelling and persuade more   ecologists to use these techniques.",2113,NO,CS,,,

However, kin-structure likely affects contact rates in a   scale-dependent manner: increasing contact rates within, but decreasing   contact rates amongst spatial groups. Thus, the effect of kin-structure   on disease exposure risk should depend upon the spatial scale relevant   for pathogen transmission. This study was undertaken to test the effects   of kin-structure on disease dynamics in raccoons (Procyon lotor)   inhabiting a highly fragmented agricultural ecosystem. Raccoons (n =   566) were trapped at 31 spatially discrete habitat patches (local   populations). Trapped individuals were genotyped at 13 microsatellites   and their serum screened for antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV)   and multiple Leptospira spp. serovars. Our analyses revealed that the   effects of kin-structure on transmission dynamics are dependent on both   spatial scale and the pathogen under consideration. Thus, in the   directly transmitted pathogen (CDV), the probability of pathogen   co-exposure (the proportion of individual pairs where both individuals   were seropositive for a particular pathogen) was positively correlated   with genealogical proximity within local populations. Conversely, in the   environmentally transmitted leptospires co-exposure was homogeneous   within local populations and was positively correlated with gene flow   among these populations. Our analyses also revealed that, after   controlling for confounding effects of landscape and demographic   variables, the effects of kin-structure on disease exposure risk was   pathogen-specific. In particular, increasing kin-structure was   associated with increased disease exposure risk in the directly   transmitted pathogen (CDV), and alternatively with decreased disease   exposure risk in environmentally transmitted leptospires. The potential,   scale-dependent, effects of kin-structure on disease exposure risk   revealed by our analyses could play an important role in elucidating   disease dynamics in natural populations and in planning effective   disease mitigation strategies.",2114,NO,CS,,,

Increased   waste products and continuously depleting natural resources have   diverted human attention towards efficient green and clear production   technologies. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim at providing   these fundamental necessities to everyone through the intelligent use of   sustainable science. In this perspective, microorganisms, which are   vital to the maintenance of life on earth, can play a major role.   Although most people focus primarily on the disease-causing capabilities   of microorganisms, there are numerous positive functions that microbes   perform in the environment and hence, a need to explore the microbial   world astutely as it can contribute tremendously to sustainable   development. In this review, the integration of microbial technology for   the achievement of SDGs is being put forth. The scope of the use of   microorganisms, points of their control, methods for their better   utilization and the role of education in achieving these targets are   being discussed. If the society is educated enough about the ways that   microbes can affect our lives, and if microbes are used intelligently,   then some significant problems being faced by the world today including   food, health, well-being and green energy can be adequately taken care   of.

The present study investigates the   effect of trematode parasite infection on the ecologically and   commercially important venerid clam Austrovenus stutchburyi. Although   the indirect impacts of clam infection on the broader benthic community,   mediated by impaired burrowing of parasitized clams, have been well   documented before, the more direct impacts on the clam itself remain   poorly studied. The consequence of parasite infection on clam growth   rate, mortality, body condition and foot length was quantified in a   three-month laboratory experiment, in which juvenile clams were infected   with varying levels of the echinostome trematode Curtuteria australis.   Although mortality was unaffected by parasite infection, greater numbers   of parasites deleteriously affected the growth rate, body condition and   foot length of clams. This may result in delayed maturity and a lower   filtration rate for infected individuals, as well as a reduced ability   to bury into the sediment. Consequently, increased parasite infection   not only has subsequent broader impacts on the surrounding ecological   community, but can also affect the clam host directly and lower its   value as a harvested species.

We assessed the functional spatial scales of composition   change in birds and in three types of arthropod communities (canopy,   forest-floor and flying ones) with regard to landscape heterogeneity   resulting from a large typhoon in a temperate forest of Japan. We   examined the effects of tree-fall disturbance on the communities at   various spatial scales, with special attention to compositional   evenness. The spatial scale of the best-fitting model, which was   selected from models fitted to the disturbance area at stepwise spatial   scales, was interpreted as the community-specific functional spatial   scale. The composition of all communities studied was all significantly   dependent on gap area. The functional spatial scale was highest in birds   (370 m in radius), intermediate in flying arthropods (90 m) and lowest   in canopy and forest-floor arthropods (10 m). This result may reflect   typical dispersal ability and the spatial range of resource use in the   community. Compositional changes in each community were consistent with   theory regarding traits and responses of component taxa, although the   enhancement of evenness was observed only in the arthropod communities.

The most likely impacts include: the   coextinction of parasites, a reduction in environmental heterogeneity,   the release of competitors and prey (including plants), and a loss of   quality and quantity in seed dispersal services. This, however, is based   largely on arguments by analogy with the surviving megafauna, since the   impacts of megafaunal losses are compounded in the paleoenvironmental   record with changes in climate and other human impacts. Suggested   conservation responses include: prioritizing the conservation of the   surviving megafaunal species and reintroducing them, where possible,   into parts of their former ranges; reversible experiments with the   introduction of taxon substitutes outside their natural ranges; and   special conservation attention to megafaunal-dependent orphans and   anachronisms.

We assessed long-term (similar to 14-year)   changes in liana abundance and forest dynamics within 36 1-ha permanent   plots spanning similar to 600 km(2) of undisturbed rainforest in central   Amazonia. Within each plot, we counted each liana stem (>= 2 cm   diameter) and measured its diameter at 1.3 m height, and then used these   data to estimate liana aboveground biomass. An initial liana survey was   completed in 1997-1999 and then repeated in 2012, using identical   methods.   Liana abundance in the plots increased by an average of 1.00\% +/-   0.88\% per year, leading to a highly significant (t = 6.58, df = 35, P <   0.00001) increase in liana stem numbers. Liana biomass rose more slowly   over time (0.32\% +/- 1.37\% per year) and the mean difference between   the two sampling intervals was nonsignificant (t = 1.46, df = 35, P =   0.15; paired t tests). Liana size distributions shifted significantly   (chi(2) = 191, df = 8, P < 0.0001; Chi-square test for independence)   between censuses, mainly as a result of a nearly 40\% increase in the   number of smaller (2-3 cm diameter) lianas, suggesting that lianas   recruited rapidly during the study.   We used long-term data on rainfall and forest dynamics from our study   site to test hypotheses about potential drivers of change in liana   communities. Lianas generally increase with rainfall seasonality, but we   found no significant trends over time (1997-2012) in five rainfall   parameters (total annual rainfall, dry-season rainfall, wet-season   rainfall, number of very dry months, CV of monthly rainfall). However,   rates of tree mortality and recruitment have increased significantly   over time in our plots, and general linear mixed-effect models suggested   that lianas were more abundant at sites with higher tree mortality and   flatter topography. Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2, which may   stimulate liana growth, might also have promoted liana increases.   Our findings clearly support the view that lianas are increasing in   abundance in old-growth tropical forests, possibly in response to   accelerating forest dynamics and rising CO2 concentrations. The   aboveground biomass of trees was lowest in plots with abundant lianas,   suggesting that lianas could reduce forest carbon storage and   potentially alter forest dynamics if they continue to proliferate.",2119,MAYBE,CS,yes,,

To test this premise,   we first modeled monthly variation in photosynthesis and growth of the   most widely distributed species, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii),   using a process-based model (3-PG) for the two periods. To compare with   remotely sensed variables, we converted modeled growth potential into   maximum leaf area index (LAImax), which was predicted to range from 1 to   9 across the region. On most sites, varying soil moisture storage   capacity (theta cap) from 200 to 300 mm while holding soil fertility   constant, made slight but insignificant difference in simulated LAImax   patterns. Both values of theta cap correlated well with LAI estimates   acquired from NASA's MODIS satellites in June, 2005 (r(2)=0.7). To   evaluate where 15 coniferous tree species might be prone to wide-scale   disturbance, we used climatically-driven decision-tree models,   calibrated in the 1950-1975 period, to identify vulnerable areas in   1995-2005. We stratified predictions within 34 recognized ecoregions and   compared these results with large-scale disturbances recorded on MODIS   imagery acquired between 2005 and 2009. The correlation between the   percent of species judged as vulnerable within each ecoregion and the   percent of forested areas recorded as disturbed with a MODIS-derived   Global Disturbance Index was linear and accounted for 65 to 73\% of the   observed variation, depending on whether or not disturbance by fire was   excluded from the analysis.

This   study evaluated the litter contribution from a hemiparasitic mistletoe,   Amyema miquelii (Lehm. ex Miq.) Tiegh., in an open eucalypt forest   (Eucalyptus blakelyi, E. dwyeri and E. dealbata), at three scales; the   forest stand, single trees and individual mistletoes. Litter from   mistletoes significantly increased overall litterfall by up to 189\%,   the amount of mistletoe litter being proportional to the mistletoe   biomass in the canopy. The high litter input was due to a much higher   rate of mistletoe leaf turnover than that of host trees; the host   litterfall and rate of leaf turnover was not significantly affected by   mistletoe presence. The additional litter from mistletoes also affected   the spatial and temporal distribution of litterfall due to the patchy   distribution of mistletoes and their prolonged period of high   litterfall. Associated with these changes in litterfall was an increase   in ground litter mass and plant productivity, which reflects similar   findings with root-parasitic plants.

A strong predictive relationship was   observed between survival and both temperature and late-summer rainfall.

In addition,   fecundity was correlated with spring rainfall and temperature. We   investigated and confirmed that relationships were consistent with   observed variation in the intensity of a parasitic infection.

This period is critical for badgers insofar as it   coincides with their peak involvement in road traffic accidents (RTAs).   RTA rate during this period was linked strongly to temperature,   underlining the intricate ways in which a changing climate might   interact with anthropogenic agents to influence species' population   processes. Equinoctial conditions produced significant population driver   effects. That is, while summers will always be relatively warm compared   with winters, spring and autumn weather can be more variable and   functionally delimit the `productive' vs. nonproductive period of the   year in terms of badger behavioural and physiological cycles. This study   highlights how appropriately informed conservation strategies, mindful   of trends in climatic conditions, will become ever-more essential to   ensure the survival of many species globally.",2124,NO,CS,,,

Surprisingly little is   known about the effects of such disturbances on complex agroecosystems   with multiple interacting species. The aim of this study was to assess   the effects of management by pesticide spraying on the productive   outputs and the ecological functioning of a cacao agroecosystem. We   built a mechanistic dynamic model including the dynamics of the crop, a   pest (Cacao Pod Borer, Conopomorpha cramerella) and two beneficial   insects: a hymenopteran egg-parasitoid and a ceratopogonid pollinator.   Using this model, we tested the effects of a range of pesticide types   characterized by their impacts on both the Cacao Pod Borer and the   beneficial insects. Our results showed that yield strongly varies   according to both pesticide type and timing of pesticide application.   The type of pesticide had a strong influence on the flexibility of   management. No simple spraying decision rule led to maximal yields for   all types of pesticide. Although optimal spraying strategies differed   with the type of pesticide used, they all showed a similar pattern, i.e.   they limited and postponed the Cacao Pod Borer population peak while   limiting the negative impacts on beneficial organisms. The results   highlight the non-trivial effects of pesticide application in complex   agroecosystems where associated biodiversity provides both ecosystem   services and disservices. They illustrate the critical importance of   providing good information to farmers on pesticide management because   the use of pesticides can have a negative effect on production by   decreasing ecosystem services such as pollination.",2126,NO,CS,,,

Nevertheless,   the effect of alien plants on insect biomass has not yet been   quantified. Given their critical role in transferring energy from plants   to higher trophic levels, if alien plants do affect insect biomass, this   could have far-reaching consequences for community structure. We used 35   food webs to evaluate the impacts of alien plants on insect productivity   in a native forest in the Azores. Our food webs quantified plants,   insect herbivores, and their parasitoids, which allowed us to test the   effects of alien plants on species richness and evenness, insect   abundance, insect biomass, and food-web structure. Species richness of   plants and insects, along with plant species evenness, declined as the   level of plant invasion increased. Nevertheless, none of the 4   quantitative food-web descriptors (number of links, link density,   connectance, and interaction evenness) varied significantly with plant   invasion independent of the size of the food web. Overall, insect   abundance was not significantly affected by alien plants, but insect   biomass was significantly reduced. This effect was due to the   replacement of large insects on native plants with small insects on   alien plants. Furthermore, the impact of alien plants was sufficiently   severe to invert the otherwise expected pattern of species-richness   decline with increased elevation. We predict a decrease in insect   productivity by over 67\% if conservation efforts fail to halt the   invasion of alien plants in the Azores.",2127,NO,CS,,,

The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in   determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds   either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics   of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and   assemblage composition.   2. We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain   diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with   a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that   our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed   predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their   responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and   (ii) their host plant specificity.   3. Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using   manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect   seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density   of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of   spatial scales.   5. Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through   quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to   host-parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess   the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent   competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and   the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or   consumer species.   6. Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require   studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic   information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in   seed predation rates for plant recruitment.   Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important   insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received   relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and   sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global   environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding   of the ecology of insect seed predator-plant interactions will be   valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and   agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is   relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or   unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the   process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing   the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops.   Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are   likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers   such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and   fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of   ecological communities more widely.",2128,NO,CS,,,

Prediction relies on models that   describe our understanding of the major processes that underlie system   dynamics and data about these processes and the present state of   ecosystems. Prediction becomes more effective when models are well   informed by data. A technological revolution in the capacity to collect   data now provides very different opportunities to test hypotheses and   project future dynamics than when many standard statistical tests were   first developed. Data assimilation is an emerging statistical approach   to combine models with data in a rigorous way to constrain model   parameters and system states, identify model error, and improve   ecological prediction. In this paper, we illustrate how data   assimilation can improve ecological prediction to support   decision-making by reviewing applications of data assimilation across   four different research fields: (1) emerging infectious disease, (2)   fisheries, (3) fire, and (4) the terrestrial carbon cycle. Across these   fields, data assimilation substantially improves prediction accuracy,   highlighting its important role in enabling predictive ecology. Data   assimilation with regional and global models faces major challenges,   such as the large number of parameters to be estimated, high   computational demands, the need to integrate multiple and heterogeneous   data sets, and complex social-ecological interactions.

Their efficiency in phosphorus (P) removal   notably depends on plant uptake and storage in aboveground tissues. In   this study, Populus NM5 (P. nigra x P. maximowiczii), Salix miyabeana   (SX64) and Salix viminalis (5027) were planted in pots to evaluate the   influence of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) Glomus   intraradices on P uptake using two different P concentrations in   irrigation water. Based on analysis of the foliar and woody components,   our results show that the two treatments (inoculation with G.   intaradices and P-irrigation) interact differently with total P content.   Foliar P content is principally enhanced by the P-irrigation   concentration, whereas the mycorrhizal colonization increases stem P   content. In the presence of G. intraradices, both S. miyabeana and S.   viminalis showed a 33\% increase in stem P content. The latter finding   is mainly due to an increase in biomass production, without modification   of the P concentration, indicating that AMF associations affect P use   efficiency. Thus, using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for   phytoremediation strategies may increase biomass productivity and hence   improve pollutant uptake. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In   Mediterranean forests drought is a major constraint for regeneration,   but likely not the only factor determining the observed spatial   patterns. We carried out a sowing experiment aimed at identifying main   filters during seed-seedling transition. Specifically, we studied seed   fate (predation, fungi infection, emergence) and subsequent seedling   performance (mortality during the first summer and overall recruitment   after 2 years) of four co-occurring Mediterranean tree species (Quercus   ilex, Quercus faginea, Juniperus thurifera, Pinus nigra). We related   these processes to the dominant species composition, microhabitat   heterogeneity, herb cover and seed mass. The identity of the dominant   species in the forest canopy was more important for recruitment than the   forest canopy being dominated by conspecific vs. heterospecific species.   The patterns we found suggest that biotic interactions such as   facilitation (lower mortality under the canopies) and herb competition   (during emergence of J. thurifera) are relevant during recruitment.   Moreover, our results pointed to ontogenetic conflicts regarding the   seed mass of Q. faginea and to density-dependent seed mortality for Q.   ilex, rarely described in Mediterranean ecosystems. We propose that our   study species experience population growth in forests dominated by   heterospecifics where the recruitment success depends on habitat   heterogeneity and on moderated biotic and abiotic stresses created by   each species.

The host-pathogen interaction between conifer hosts   and bark beetles is a good example of such a system. If the density of   attacking beetles on a host tree is lower than a critical threshold, the   host repels the attack and kills the beetles. If attack densities are   above the threshold, then beetles kill the host tree and successfully   reproduce. While the threshold has been found to correlate strongly with   host growth, an explicit link between host physiology and host defense   has not been established. In this article, we revisit published models   for conifer-bark beetle interactions and demonstrate that the stability   of the steady states is not consistent with empirical observations.   Based on these results, we develop a new model that explicitly describes   host damage caused by the pathogen and use the physiological   characteristics of the host to relate host growth to defense. We   parameterize the model for mountain pine beetles and compare model   predictions with independent data on the threshold for successful   attack. The agreement between model prediction and the observed   threshold suggests the new model is an effective description of the   host-pathogen interaction. As a result of the link between the   host-pathogen interaction and the emergent Allee effect, our model can   be used to better understand how the characteristics of different bark   beetle and host species influence host pathogen dynamics in this system.",2132,NO,CS,,,

To address this issue, we examined the influence of land-cover   changes between 1942 and 2000 on the establishment of an invasive   pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, which causes the forest disease known as   Sudden Oak Death. We assessed effects of land-cover change, forest   structure, and understory microclimate on measures of inoculum load and   disease prevalence in 102 15 X 15 m plots within a 275-km(2) region in   northern California. Within a 150 m radius area around each plot, we   mapped types of land cover (oak woodland, chaparral, grassland,   vineyard, and development) in 1942 and 2000 using detailed aerial   photos. During this 58-year period, oak woodlands significantly   increased in area by 25\%, while grassland and chaparral decreased by   34\% and 51\%, respectively. Analysis of covariance revealed that   vegetation type in 1942 and woodland expansion were significant   predictors of pathogen inoculum load in bay laurel (Umbellularia   californica), the primary inoculum-producing host for P. ramorum in   mixed evergreen forests. Path analysis showed that woodland expansion   resulted in larger forests with higher densities of the primary host   trees (U. calfornica, Quercus agrifolia, Q. kelloggii) and cooler   understory temperatures. Together, the positive effects of woodland size   and negative effects of understory temperature explained significant   variation in inoculum load and disease prevalence in bay laurel; host   stem density had additional positive effects on inoculum load. We   conclude that enlargement of woodlands and closure of canopy gaps,   likely due largely to years of fire suppression, facilitated   establishment of P. ramorum by increasing the area occupied by   inoculum-production foliar hosts and enhancing forest microclimate   conditions.

Aquatic organisms are particularly susceptible to   pollutants due to their large, fragile respiratory epithelium. This   potential toxicity can be exacerbated by common stressors, such as   changes in water temperature, salinity, pH, and oxygen levels, and must   be considered in environmental risk assessments. The unique properties   of manufactured nanoparticles present serious problems for risk   assessment strategies, and there is a concern in the regulatory   community that standard toxicological methods may be inadequate to   address these compounds.

The effects of herbivores and pathogens are   mediated by the diversity and functional characteristics of their host   plants. However, the combined effects of herbivory and pathogen damage,   and their consequences for plant performance, have not yet been   addressed in the context of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research.   We analyzed the relationships between herbivory, fungal pathogen damage   and their effects on tree growth in a large-scale forest-biodiversity   experiment. Moreover, we tested whether variation in leaf trait and   climatic niche characteristics among tree species influenced these   relationships. We found significant positive effects of herbivory on   pathogen damage, and vice versa. These effects were attenuated by tree   species richnessbecause herbivory increased and pathogen damage   decreased with increasing richnessand were most pronounced for species   with soft leaves and narrow climatic niches. However, herbivory and   pathogens had contrasting, independent effects on tree growth, with   pathogens decreasing and herbivory increasing growth. The positive   herbivory effects indicate that trees might be able to (over-)compensate   for local damage at the level of the whole tree. Nevertheless, we found   a dependence of these effects on richness, leaf traits and climatic   niche characteristics of the tree species. This could mean that the   ability for compensation is influenced by both biodiversity loss and   tree species identityincluding effects of larger-scale climatic   adaptations that have been rarely considered in this context.

In colonies   dependent on nutritionally limited resources, corpses represent both a   food resource and a risk of pathogens. Because this risk vs. reward   changes with time after death, behavioural plasticity in the response to   corpses would be advantageous. How social insects regulate this   trade-off remains unknown. We conducted quantitative behavioural   bioassay and chemical analysis to study corpse management in the eastern   subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. We hypothesized that R.   flavipes responds differently towards corpses with prolonged post-mortem   time, and this behavioural plasticity is mediated by the dynamic change   in death cues. We show that R. flavipes uses a post-mortem signalling   system that depends on an early death cue that stimulates corpse   retrieval and cannibalism, and late death cues that stimulate   recruitment and burial. A blend of 3-octanone and 3-octanol is released   immediately after death, with the alcohol (possibly in conjunction with   the ketone) playing a clear role as a death cue. This cue enables the   colony to recycle nutrients before decomposition occurs and before risk   of pathogens increases. The accumulation of late death cues,   decomposition products shared by diverse arthropods, elicits a   behavioural switch from cannibalism to burial. The ability to detect and   respond to the dead is vital to group-living animals. Our study reveals   a behavioural shift in corpse management triggered by the interplay of   an early death cue and late death cues, which balances risks and rewards   associated with corpses.

However, there is only limited understanding of the   multiple biotic interactions in perennial cropping systems and their   potential effects on the crop, involving plant growth-promoting and   pathogenic microorganisms, beneficial and detrimental faunal organisms   below-and above-ground, weeds, and overall biodiversity effects. We use   information from studies carried out in managed and natural perennial   systems of analogous structure such as perennial energy crop production   systems and grasslands to highlight and specify biotic interactions and   processes, which potentially constitute advantages and constraints in   developing perennial grain cropping systems. Concerning the relevance of   soil microorganisms and potential perennial crop breeding goals, we   focus on a range of plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere   involved in biofertilization, phytostimulation, and biological control   of soil pathogens. We consider relationships within the faunal community   emphasizing arthropod pests and their natural enemies, as well as   crop-weed interactions. Based on these outcomes and in comparison with   annual systems, we discuss and compile benefits, options, and   limitations of management of crop-associated biotic interactions and   biodiversity, which might contribute to reproducible and sustainable   effects of perennial grain crop productivity. We conclude that   management strategies for perennial grain cropping systems depend much   more on ecological processes and interactions operating in natural   ecosystems than those in annual cropping systems. Consequently, the use   of agrochemicals for pest, weed, and disease control, as well as the use   of synthetic fertilizers, counteracts the principle functions of the   system and would strongly degrade the potential of biotic benefits. We   also found that there is only vague information on the long-term   productivity and cultivation period of perennial grain crops, the   specific management operations of replacement, and the potential   development and management of weed and pest populations.

We examined the influence of herbaceous   competition and water and nitrogen limitations on tree seedling   establishment as functions of distance from trees (within-site spatial   context) and site history (between-site spatial context; as old-fields   vs. savanna openings).   We grew Quercus ellipsoidalis E.J. Hill (pin oak) and Q. macrocarpa   Michx. (bur oak) seedlings for 3 years in abandoned agricultural fields   and savannas in central Minnesota, USA, near and distant from adult oak   trees, with and without water and nitrogen resource additions, and with   and without clipping of herbaceous vegetation (reducing above-ground   competition).   The strongest treatment effects were found in response to distance from   trees and clipping herbaceous vegetation. Ectomycorrhizal infection,   year 1 foliar N concentrations, and survival were greater in seedlings   growing near vs. distant from adult trees, while clipping herbaceous   vegetation increased above-ground seedling biomass but reduced seedling   heights, regardless of distance from adult trees.   There were conflicting effects of resource addition, which were   dependent on clipping of herbaceous vegetation and site (savanna vs.   old-field).   Distance from adult trees and clipping herbaceous vegetation appear to   have largely independent effects. Thus, while being near trees benefits   seedlings, probably via increased mycorrhizal infection, competition   from herbaceous vegetation limits seedlings regardless of distance from   trees. In contrast, the effects of resource addition were more context   dependent, interacting significantly with herbaceous context and site.   The factors influencing seedling success can perhaps be best   conceptualized as a series of largely independent environmental filters:   seedlings near trees have increased mycorrhizal infection, nutrient   uptake and survival, but face competition from herbaceous vegetation   regardless of distance from trees. The slow encroachment of woody   vegetation into old-fields and savanna openings in this region is likely   to be the result of the net cumulative effect of such filters.",2141,NO,CS,,,

Here we   study two congeneric North American ducks: Redhead Aythya americana and   Canvasback A. vaselineria. Both are largely sympatric during the   breeding season, and in addition to competition, facultative parasitic   egg-laying can lead to interspecific density dependence. Using   multi-population integrated models, we combined capture-recovery data,   population surveys, and age ratio data in order to simultaneously   estimate the mechanistic drivers of fecundity, survival, and population   dynamics for both species. Canvasback numbers positively affected   Redhead fecundity, whereas Redhead numbers negatively affected   Canvasback fecundity, as expected due to parasitism. This interaction   was modulated by wetland habitat availability in a way that matched the   observation that Redhead hens parasitize Canvasback nests under all   conditions but exhibit typical nesting behavior more frequently during   years with numerous ponds. Once these effects of density and habitat   were statistically controlled for, we found high levels of interspecific   synchrony in both fecundity and survival (respectively, 75\% and 49\% of   remaining variation).

Ants are ubiquitous ecosystem engineers and generalist predators   and are able to affect ecological communities via both pathways. They   are likely to influence any other terrestrial arthropod group either   directly or indirectly caused by their high abundance and   territoriality.   2. We studied the impact of two ant species common in Central Europe,   Myrmica rubra and Lasius niger, on an arthropod community. Colony   presence and density of these two ant species were manipulated in a   field experiment from the start of ant activity in spring to late   summer.   3. The experiment revealed a positive influence of the presence of one   ant colony on densities of decomposers, herbivores and parasitoids.   However, in the case of herbivores and parasitoids, this effect was   reversed in the presence of two colonies.   4. Generally, effects of the two ant species were similar with the   exception of their effect on Braconidae parasitoid densities that   responded positively to one colony of M. rubra but not of L. niger.   5. Spider density was not affected by ant colony manipulation, but   species richness of spiders responded positively to ant presence. This   effect was independent of ant colony density, but where two colonies   were present, spider richness was significantly greater in plots with   two M. rubra colonies than in plots with one colony of each ant species.   6. To test whether the positive ecosystem engineering effects were   purely caused by modified properties of the soil, we added in an   additional experiment (i) the soil from ant nests (without ants) or (ii)   unmodified soil or (iii) ant nests (including ants) to experimental   plots. Ant nest soil on its own did not have a significant impact on   densities of decomposers, herbivores or predators, which were   significantly, and positively, affected by the addition of an intact   nest.   7. The results suggest an important role of both ant species in the   grassland food web, strongly affecting the densities of decomposers,   herbivores and higher trophic levels. We discuss how the relative impact   via bottom-up and top-down effects of ants depends on nest density, with   a relatively greater top-down predatory impact at higher densities.",2144,NO,CS,,,

Few   assisted migration trials have considered limitations of the cooler   climates and pathogens currently present at transplant sites. This is   especially important to consider in riparian ecosystems that are   priority targets for restoration in the western United States as they   harbor diverse communities. In an effort to validate assisted migration   as an effective strategy for mediating the negative impacts of climate   change, we used a provenance trial with replicated genotypes from 19   populations of the foundation riparian tree species, Fremont cottonwood   (Populus fremontii), transplanted to a cold site to test for genetic   variation in growth, mortality, and resistance to shoot blight fungi   (Venturia sp.). Populations from cool sites had up to 4 times faster   growth, 3 times higher survival, and 8 times higher resistance to   Venturia than populations from warm sites, providing evidence of local   adaptation to both climate and pathogenic fungi. Budburst phenology and   shoot blight were correlated with frost damage, subsequent shrub-form   architecture, and mortality. While climate change models predict 6   degrees C increases, plants transferred distances of 6 degrees C at this   time would not perform well; an intermediate transfer distance of less   than 3 degrees C would avoid maladaptation to the current environment   during assisted migration. Thus, multiple and intermediate transfer   phases to supplement local genetic variation will likely be necessary   for effective assisted migration to accommodate current environments and   large changes in climate.",2145,MAYBE,CS,yes,,

We studied the impacts of   an exotic pest/pathogen complex, the beech bark disease (BBD), in the   Catskill Mountains of New York State, USA. In this region, BBD has   caused a decline in the basal area of American beech (Fagus grandifolia   Ehrh.) over the last 60 years and this decline has been accompanied by   an increase in the basal area of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). We   studied the impacts of the BBD on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling   using a series of stands that represented a sequence of disease impact   and beech replacement by sugar maple. Our study showed that these   long-term changes in tree species composition can lead to important   changes in C and N cycling in the ecosystem, including an increase in   litter decomposition, a decrease in soil C:N ratio, and an increase in   extractable nitrate in the soil and nitrate in soil solution. Rates of   potential net N mineralization and nitrification did not change across   the BBD sequence, but the fraction of mineralized N that was nitrified   increased significantly. Many of the observed changes in ecosystem   function are larger in magnitude than those attributed to climate change   or air pollution, suggesting that the impacts of invasive pests and   pathogens on tree species composition could be one of the most important   factors driving changes in C and N cycling in these forests in the   coming decades.",2146,YES,CS,yes,,

Thus, by   grouping species with similar water-use strategies into `hydraulic   functional types' (HFTs), we investigated the characteristics of water   use in species-rich plant communities of south-western Australia. HFTs   were determined using multiple-trait associations between morphological   and physiological traits relating to water transport, water-use   efficiency and response to water deficit. Sixteen traits were assessed   from a subset of 21 species from three plant communities located along a   topographically determined soil- and water-availability gradient.   Multivariate analyses showed that trait variation was least at sites   with shallower soils and putatively lower water availability, suggesting   a convergence of water-use strategies at sites where plants are exposed   to large seasonal water deficits. Stem hydraulic parameters, including   stem-specific hydraulic conductivity, conduit diameter and maximum   percentage embolism, were positively correlated, indicating the   generality that larger conduit diameter permits greater hydraulic   efficiency and is associated with greater seasonal reductions in   hydraulic conductivity in this ecosystem. Wood density was not   correlated with these traits, but closely associated with species'   ability to withstand more negative water potentials during summer.   Long-term integrated water-use efficiency was lower in shallow-rooted   species that exhibited more negative summer water potentials. Specific   leaf area and minimum leaf water potential were correlated with a number   of separate traits, and appear to represent key axes of trait variation   that describe the water-use strategies of different HFTs along the   topographic gradient. Five HFTs were classified using a resemblance   analysis according to combinations of traits that pertain to different   water-use strategies among species; year-round active tree, year-round   active shrub, hemiparasite, drought-suppressed broad-leaved shrub and   drought-suppressed narrow-leaved shrub.",2147,MAYBE,CS,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,water use potential

Hamiltonella defensa is a facultative, bacterial symbiont of   the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum that provides protection against the   endoparasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi. Protection levels vary among strains   of H. defensa that are differentially infected by bacteriophages named   APSEs. By contrast, little is known about mechanism(s) of resistance   owing to the intractability of host-restricted microbes for functional   study. Here, we developed methods for culturing strains of H. defensa   that varied in the presence and type of APSE. Most H. defensa strains   proliferated at 27 degrees C in co-cultures with the TN5 cell line or as   pure cultures with no insect cells. The strain infected by APSE3, which   provides high levels of protection in vivo, produced a soluble factor(s)   that disabled development of A. ervi embryos independent of any aphid   factors. Experimental transfer of APSE3 also conferred the ability to   disable A. ervi development to a phage-free strain of H. defensa.   Altogether, these results provide a critical foundation for   characterizing symbiont-derived factor(s) involved in host protection   and other functions.

However, insight is needed on how the combination of   conservation tillage and crop rotation enhances the resilience of   intensive short-term potato cropping systems, specifically the   restoration of the soil condition after the perturbations that occur in   the potato phase. A long-term 3-year rotation (potato-barley-red clover)   and conservation tillage study was initiated in 1994 on a fine sandy   loam in Prince Edward Island, eastern Canada. Over a 3-year period   (2004-2006), soil physical (bulk density) and biological (C and N   fractions, structural stability; densities of plant parasitic and   bacterial-feeding nematodes, and micro-arthropod abundance and   diversity) properties were monitored over each phase of the crop   rotation cycle to assess the restoration or rejuvenation of the surface   (0-10 cm) soil condition. Conservation compared to conventional tillage,   increased soil organic C, large water-stable macro-aggregates, and soil   particulate C and N in the potato year only. After the potato phase,   rotation crops were associated with the further restoration of all soil   C and N fractions and soil structural stability indices; and also   increases in soil microbial biomass C and microbial activity indices,   and soil Collembola abundance. Soil nematode densities showed some   incidences of treatment differences but no clear trends. The study   indicated that conservation tillage has a positive influence on soil   biological properties and that the 3-year rotation successfully restored   many of the soil parameters that had declined in the potato year.

The   declining cover of natural and semi-natural habitats, in particular, has   been shown to reduce natural-enemy attack of crop pests, but also in   some cases reduced crop colonization by such pests. In this study, we   examined the influence of changes in two elements of landscape   composition, natural grassland cover and cover of a highly suitable crop   host, on infestation by a generalist insect pest in wheat, and   parasitism of this pest by its dominant natural enemies. Surprisingly,   we found no significant influences of increasing natural grassland   habitat, at either local or landscape scales, on infestation by the   wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus, or parasitism of this pest by the   native parasitoid wasps, Bracon cephi and Bracon lissogaster. In   contrast, we found significant increases in levels of C cinctus   infestation with increasing wheat cover at the landscape scale. This   pattern was consistent across six study regions spanning three states in   the northern Great Plains of North America, despite large differences in   cropping systems and pest population densities across regions. Regional   variation in pest infestation was best explained by long-term averages   in precipitation, with higher C. cinctus infestation rates found in   drier regions. Results suggest that landscape-mediated variation in pest   pressure in this system is better explained by a direct response of pest   insects to increasing cover of a highly suitable crop rather than an   indirect response via reductions in natural enemies as natural habitat   declines. The implication is that habitat diversification at the   landscape scale could play a role in suppressing agricultural pest   populations via reductions in area of suitable crop hosts.

LocationForests restored by planting a high diversity assemblage of tree   species, within the Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil.   MethodsWe sampled all reproductive individuals (353 species) and   classified them in terms of floral type, colour, size, generalization   level and openness. As most trees were planted and non-tree species   (sub-shrub, shrub, herbs, epiphytes, climbers and hemi-parasitic plants)   were mostly naturally established, we analysed them in separate   analyses. We compared species richness, functional diversity, redundancy   and originality among sites. Moreover, we identified optimal subsets of   flower traits to describe vegetation succession trends.   Results(1) Flower functional diversity of tree species could be achieved   after two decades of restoration, but remained far from reference values   for non-tree species. The same gap regarding reference values occurred   with species richness, which increased over restoration periods,   although were far from the reference values. Redundancy and functional   diversity are not related to restoration age.

ConclusionA highly diverse species pool seems to promise to increase   richness and functional diversity of tree species, but not of non-tree   species. Trait analyses have important implications for restoration   projects and can be used instead of species taxonomic identity,   especially for highly diverse tropical forests. Such functional   diversity may be advanced through a priori definition of which species   from the regional pool can be used in plantings for forest restoration,   with special attention to functional traits of non-tree species.   Otherwise, restoration sites in highly fragmented landscapes will not   reach functional diversity of reference sites, even after a five-decade   period.",2151,NO,CS,,,

Although modeling tools are needed to design innovative   integrated pest management strategies that consider tritrophic   interactions at the landscape scale, landscape models that consider   agricultural practices as levers to enhance biological regulation are   lacking. To begin filling this gap, we developed a grid-based lattice   model called Mosaic-Pest that simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of   Meligethes aeneus, a major pest of oilseed rape, and its parasitoid,   Tersilochus heterocerus through a landscape that changes through time   according to agricultural practices. The following agricultural   practices were assumed to influence the tritrophic system and were   included in the model: crop allocation in time and space, ploughing, and   trap crop planting. To test the effect of agricultural practices on   biological regulation across landscape configurations, we used a   complete factorial design with the variables described below and ran   long-term simulations using Mosaic-Pest. The model showed that crop   rotation and the use of trap crop greatly affected pollen beetle   densities and parasitism rates while ploughing had only a small effect.   The use of Mosaic-Pest as a tool to select the combination of   agricultural practices that best limit the pest population is discussed.",2157,NO,CS,,,

Applicable at different   geographical scales and organizational levels, alien species indicators   struggle with data availability and quality. Based on policy needs and   previous work on the global scale, we here present a set of six alien   species indicators for Europe, which capture complementary facets of   biological invasions in Europe: (a) an combined index of invasion   trends, (b) an indicator on pathways of invasions, (c) the Red List   Index of Invasive Alien Species (IAS), (d) an indicator of IAS impacts   on ecosystem services, (e) trends in incidence of livestock diseases and   (f) an indicator on costs for alien species management and research.   Each of these indicators has its particular strengths and shortcomings,   but combined they allow for a nuanced understanding of the status and   trends of biological invasions in Europe. We found that the scale and   impact of biological invasions are steadily increasing across all impact   indicators, although societal response in recent years has increased.   The Red List Index is fit-for-purpose and demonstrates that overall   extinction risks (here shown for amphibians in Europe) are increasing.   Introduction pathway dynamics have changed, with some pathways   decreasing in relevance (e.g., biological control agents) and others   increasing (e.g., horticultural trade) providing a leverage for targeted   policy and stakeholder response. The IAS indicators presented here for   the first time on a continental basis serve as a starting point for   future improvements, and as a basis for monitoring the efficacy of the   recent EU legislation of IAS. This will need a better work-flow for data   collection and management. To achieve this, all main actors must work   toward improving the interoperability among existing databases and   between data holders. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",2161,NO,CS,,,

Current process-based modeling approaches of insect   outbreaks are often based on population processes operating at small   spatial scales (i.e. within individual forest stands). As such, they are   difficult to parameterize and offer limited applicability when modeling   and predicting outbreaks at the landscape level where management actions   take place. In this paper, we propose a new process-based landscape   model of forest insect outbreaks that is based on stand defoliation, the   Forest-Infected-Recovering-Forest (FIRF) model. We explore both   spatially-implicit (mean field equations with global dispersal) and   spatially-explicit (cellular automata with limited dispersal between   neighboring stands) versions of this model to assess the role of   dispersal in the landscape dynamics of outbreaks. We show that   density-dependent dispersal is necessary to generate cyclic outbreaks in   the spatially-implicit version of the model. The spatially-explicit FIRF   model with local and stochastic dispersal displays cyclic outbreaks at   the landscape scale and patchy outbreaks in space, even without   density-dependence. Our simple, process-based FIRF model reproduces   large scale outbreaks and can provide an innovative approach to model   and manage forest pests at the landscape scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, this process is   unlikely to be successful and cost effective without access to an   independently verified and comprehensive available list of options.   There is currently burgeoning interest in ecosystem services and   quantitative assessments of their importance and value. Recognition of   the value of ecosystem services to human well-being represents an   increasingly important argument for protecting and restoring the natural   environment, alongside the moral and ethical justifications for   conservation. As well as understanding the benefits of ecosystem   services, it is also important to synthesize the practical interventions   that are capable of maintaining and/or enhancing these services. Apart   from pest regulation, pollination, and global climate regulation, this   type of exercise has attracted relatively little attention. Through a   systematic consultation exercise, we identify a candidate list of 296   possible interventions across the main regulating services of air   quality regulation, climate regulation, water flow regulation, erosion   regulation, water purification and waste treatment, disease regulation,   pest regulation, pollination and natural hazard regulation. The range of   interventions differs greatly between habitats and services depending   upon the ease of manipulation and the level of research intensity. Some   interventions have the potential to deliver benefits across a range of   regulating services, especially those that reduce soil loss and maintain   forest cover. Synthesis and applications: Solution scanning is important   for questioning existing knowledge and identifying the range of options   available to researchers and practitioners, as well as serving as the   necessary basis for assessing cost effectiveness and guiding   implementation strategies.

Human alterations   can increase the attractiveness of a low-quality habitat and/or decrease   the suitability of a high-quality habitat, herewith creating an   ecological trap. In an ecological trap, animals prefer to stay in   habitats where mortality exceeds natality, which can result in   extirpation of a population. It is important to distinguish ecological   traps from sinks; however, relative population densities do not   necessarily give reliable information. In order to identify ecological   traps and set appropriate conservation priorities, it is necessary to   gain insight into the relationship between habitat preference, quality   and suitability. In this study, we used African wild dog hunt data and   energetic cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the preferred   habitat outside Hwange National Park (HNP) serves as an ecological trap.   This analysis enabled us to take several ecological factors into account   while assessing habitat quality. Although outside HNP anthropogenic   mortality exceeded natality, per capita energetic intake was higher.   This indicates that the habitat outside HNP serves as an ecological trap   where human alterations have decreased the suitability of the high   quality habitat. In order to ensure the recovery of the African wild dog   population, conservation efforts should therefore focus on improving the   suitability of the habitat outside HNP. This study shows that an   energetic cost-benefit analysis can assist with identifying ecological   traps and setting conservation priorities. Moreover, in cases of social   territorial species, the cost-benefit analysis may also help to identify   ecological traps before source populations are depleted, thus increasing   the likelihood of population recovery.",2165,NO,CS,,,

Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity   and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the   impact of landscape changes. Wildflower strips are ecological   compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination   services and biological control of crop pests and to conserve insect   diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species   richness and abundance of the fauna. We describe results from   experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape,   comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement and of   vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps   and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. The proportion   of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape   heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements,   resulting in a more complex trap-nest community with higher abundance   and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food   webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the   underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food web   metrics. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and   abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a   potentially stable community of cavity-nesting hymenoptera in wildflower   strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment   of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial   insect populations.",2166,NO,CS,,,

The aim was   to determine which factor(s) controlled viral dynamics using detailed   concomitant published data on inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll a,   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bacterial production for Beaver Lake   (Freshwater Biology, 51, 2006, 1119). Denaturing Gradient Gel   Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the bacterial community was also   undertaken to investigate the potential relationship between bacterial   community composition and viral dynamics. Virus concentration ranged   between 1.43x104 and 302.4x104 virusesmL-1 and showed a clear increase   over the summer, while bacterial concentrations exhibited no seasonal   pattern (range: 9.6x104 to 44.6x104 cellsmL-1). Consequently, VBR varied   with highest values in January (3.32-7.33). The percentage of lysogenic   phage was low, ranging from 0 to 11.69\%, suggesting that other life   cycles (i.e. lytic or possibly pseudolysogeny) were taking place.   Attempts to measure viral production using both the TdR incorporation   technique and the dilution technique failed to produce consistent   results, in common with other ultra-oligotrophic Antarctic lakes. There   were significant correlations between viral concentration and each of   chlorophyll a, DOC, ammonium and nitrate concentrations and bacterial   production, but not between bacterial abundance and either soluble   reactive phosphorus or temperature. Lack of change in the dominant   bacterial community composition over summer suggests that changes in   viral concentrations were a function of changes in other biological and   physicochemical factors, rather than changes in host/phage infection.   The results suggest a significant connection between viruses and   bacteria, with the DOC pool acting as a conduit for the movement of   carbon between the two components.",2167,MAYBE,CS,yes,,

Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality   in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has   been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local   adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in   non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree   in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of   its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern   tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x   environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of   Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent   introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in   western North America is generally adapted to local environmental   conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two   species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource   availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and   (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and   increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based   on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on   the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in   Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to   non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis   for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor   edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a   minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon   and its demand by various sinks. Identifying patterns of local   adaptation of traits related to resource allocation will improve   forecasting of Tamarix population susceptibility to episodic herbivory.",2168,NO,CS,,,

Such   DNA-based techniques have largely been used to establish the presence of   free-living organisms, but have much potential for detecting and   quantifying infectious agents in the environment, which is necessary to   evaluate disease risk. We developed an eDNA method to examine the   distribution and abundance of the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae, a   pathogenic parasite known to cause malformations in North American   amphibians. In addition to comparing this eDNA approach to classical   host necropsy, we examined the detectability of R. ondatrae in water   samples subject to different degradation conditions (time and   temperature). Our test exhibited high specificity and sensitivity to R.   ondatrae, capable of detecting as little as 14 fg (femtograms) of this   parasite's DNA (1/2500th of a single infectious stage) from field water   samples. Compared to our results from amphibian host necropsy,   quantitative PCR was similar to 90\% concordant with respect to R.   ondatrae detection from 15 field sites and was also a significant   predictor of host infection abundance. DNA was still detectable in lab   samples after 21 days at 25 degrees C, indicating that our method is   robust to field conditions. By comparing the advantages and   disadvantages of eDNA vs. traditional survey methods for determining   pathogen presence and abundance in the field, we found that the lower   cost and effort associated with eDNA approaches provide many advantages.
