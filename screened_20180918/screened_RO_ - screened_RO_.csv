We examined the associations of environmental variables with   fungal community structures in dead pine logs at 12 geographically   distant sites using amplicon pyrosequencing of fungal ITS rDNA. A total   of 575 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified based on   clustering at 97\% similarity. Among the known fungal ecological groups,   saprotrophic fungi generally showed highest frequency of occurrence and   were positively associated with mean annual temperature (MAT) and log   diameter. Wood decay fungi with unknown decay type were positively   associated with pine wilt disease and negatively associated with log   diameter. Ordination analysis of the 42 most prevalent OTUs showed that   MAT and annual precipitation significantly explained the observed fungal   community structure. These results suggested that climate conditions and   site history differentially effect structure fungal communities in pine   logs among different ecological groups.

A growing number of studies indicate   that plants can also influence the performance of the natural enemies of   the herbivores. Plant species in the Brassicaceae produce secondary   compounds known as glucosinolates (GLS) whose hydrolysis products are   potentially toxic to many herbivores. Some specialist insects are known   to sequester the GLS, but up to date, there is no data on impact of GLS   sequestration by insect herbivores on the performance of their   parasitoids. We asked whether the performance of the GLS-sequestering   aphid Brevicoryne brassicae and its parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae were   affected by the host plants on which they feed. We selected four host   plant species, one cultivar of Brassica oleracea and B. napus, and two   wild species, B. nigra and Sinapis arvensis. Among other traits, these   species differ in GLS content and composition as well as in some   morphological characteristics. Population growth rate of Br brassicae   was not affected by host plant species. However, adult aphids were the   smallest, but also lived the longest when they had developed on the B.   oleracea cultivar. Parasitoids were larger when their aphid hosts fed on   the wild species. Unexpectedly, parasitism rate was lower on B.   oleracea. Thus, variation in host plant characteristics had an impact on   the fitness of the parasitoid through its aphid host. In contrast to   previous studies, which have shown that sequestration is a good defence   mechanism against predators, we did not observe that Br brassicae   benefits from the sequestration of GLS to limit attacks by its main   parasitoid.",1630,no,RO,,,
Heloise Gibb,2012,How Might Terrestrial Arthropod Assemblages Have Changed After the   Dramatic Decline of Critical Weight Range (CWR) Mammals in Australia?   Using Reintroductions at Scotia Sanctuary as a Model for Pre-European   Ecosystems,PROCEEDINGS OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES,A19-A26,A19-A26,NA,"In Australia, populations of mammals within the critical weight range   (CWR) of 35 to 5500 g have been severely affected by European   settlement, with twenty-two species having become extinct over the past   200 years. Many highly threatened CWR mammals, such as bilbies,   bandicoots and numbats, are insectivorous or omnivorous, and   invertebrates comprise a significant portion of their diet.   Additionally, such mammals cause significant disturbance to arthropod   habitats through burrowing and engage in a range of other interactions   with arthropods, including mutualisms, parasitism and competition. The   loss of this trophic level is thus likely to have had considerable   impacts on arthropods. Here, I consider the potential effects of the   dramatic decline of native omnivores on the abundance, diversity,   composition, morphology and functional roles performed by arthropods. I   also discuss reintroductions such as that at Scotia Sanctuary in western   NSW and other conservation sites as a model for understanding the   pre-European state of arthropod-CWR mammal interactions.",1631,NO,RO,,,

The improved housing efficiency and resilience will contribute   to strengthen sanitation and hygiene, improve the living comfort and   reduce environmental impact, particularly focusing on preserving the   forest biodiversity. The project was developed following the criteria of   environmental, technical, social and economic sustainability to propose   a shared model, reproducible by the beneficiaries living in different   kinds of Mosquitian ecosystems. Increased building efficiency is   obtained through optimization of construction techniques and improvement   of materials' performances. The main material of the proposed dwelling   is wood, coherently with the ``Miskita'' tradition; the increase of   its durability, which is obtained by proper seasoning and protection   from atmospheric agents and parasites, contributes to the optimization   of the use of this natural resource and to reducing the impact on   deforestation, which threatens forest biodiversity. The data collection   campaign, conducted before developing the housing model design and which   has aimed at obtaining information on technical and social aspects   related to residences' welfare and health conditions, has highlighted   the great importance of improving the construction model. Despite the   advance in sanitary conditions and the economic level, the data   collection campaign revealed that even the most developed communities   amongst those visited have been perpetrating substantial construction   errors, which reduce the resilience of structures to extreme natural   phenomena, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which frequently   affect the Mosquitia region. This unexpected discovery increased the   importance of housing model design in order to correct these improper   construction techniques and avoid their application in the newly-started   village growth.",1632,NO,RO,,,

Mesorhizobium Strains from Different   Regions of Senegal,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,641-651,641-651,10.1007/s00248-014-0507-1,"Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal are small, deciduous legume trees, most   highly valued for nitrogen fixation and for the production of gum   arabic, a commodity of international trade since ancient times.   Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by legumes represents the main natural input   of atmospheric N-2 into ecosystems which may ultimately benefit all   organisms. We analyzed the nod and nif symbiotic genes and symbiotic   properties of root-nodulating bacteria isolated from A. senegal and A.   seyal in Senegal. The symbiotic genes of rhizobial strains from the two   Acacia species were closed to those of Mesorhizobium plurifarium and   grouped separately in the phylogenetic trees. Phylogeny of rhizobial   nitrogen fixation gene nifH was similar to those of nodulation genes   (nodA and nodC). All A. senegal rhizobial strains showed identical nodA,   nodC, and nifH gene sequences. By contrast, A. seyal rhizobial strains   exhibited different symbiotic gene sequences. Efficiency tests   demonstrated that inoculation of both Acacia species significantly   affected nodulation, total dry weight, acetylene reduction activity   (ARA), and specific acetylene reduction activity (SARA) of plants.   However, these cross-inoculation tests did not show any specificity of   Mesorhizobium strains toward a given Acacia host species in terms of   infectivity and efficiency as stated by principal component analysis   (PCA). This study demonstrates that large-scale inoculation of A.   senegal and A. seyal in the framework of reafforestation programs   requires a preliminary step of rhizobial strain selection for both   Acacia species.",1633,NO,RO,,,

Anthrax is endemic throughout Africa, causing considerable livestock   and wildlife losses and severe, sometimes fatal, infection in humans.   Predicting the risk of infection is therefore important for public   health, wildlife conservation and livestock economies. However, because   of the intermittent and variable nature of anthrax outbreaks, associated   environmental and climatic conditions, and diversity of species   affected, the ecology of this multihost pathogen is poorly understood.   2. We explored records of anthrax from the Serengeti ecosystem in   north-west Tanzania where the disease has been documented in humans,   domestic animals and a range of wildlife. Using spatial and temporal   case-detection and seroprevalence data from wild and domestic animals,   we investigated spatial, environmental, climatic and species-specific   associations in exposure and disease.   3. Anthrax was detected annually in numerous species, but large   outbreaks were spatially localized, mostly affecting a few focal   herbivores.   4. Soil alkalinity and cumulative weather extremes were identified as   useful spatial and temporal predictors of exposure and infection risk,   and for triggering the onset of large outbreaks.   5. Interacting ecological and behavioural factors, specifically   functional groups and spatiotemporal overlap, helped to explain the   variable patterns of infection and exposure among species.   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results shed light on ecological   drivers of anthrax infection and suggest that soil alkalinity and   prolonged droughts or rains are useful predictors of disease occurrence   that could guide risk-based surveillance. These insights should inform   strategies for managing anthrax including prophylactic livestock   vaccination, timing of public health warnings and antibiotic provision   in high-risk areas. However, this research highlights the need for   greater surveillance (environmental, serological and   case-detection-orientated) to determine the mechanisms underlying   anthrax dynamics.",1634,NO,RO,,,

James",2018,Spatiotemporal variation in drivers of parasitoid metacommunity   structure in continuous forest landscapes,ECOSPHERE,NA,NA,10.1002/ecs2.2075,"Although landscape spatial structure is known to influence spatial   patterns of biodiversity, its effect on insect communities at higher   trophic levels such as parasitoids remains poorly understood. This is   particularly true in continuously distributed forests in which it can be   difficult to identify clear boundaries among habitat patches. Using the   metacommunity framework, we evaluate the relative importance of forest   landscape structure, non-environmental spatial structure, and host   outbreak status to spatial and within-season temporal variation in   parasitoid communities. We used variation partitioning and metacommunity   structure analyses to identify (1) the drivers of the metacommunity   structure of parasitoids associated with the spruce budworm   (Choristoneura fumiferana), and (2) how their relative influence varies   through a season. We used a multi-scale perspective to summarize   landscape heterogeneity in regions of increasing size around the   community sampling locations. Spruce budworm larvae and pupae were   sampled during three periods during the summer 2014 in 18 locations   within continuous forest landscapes in Quebec, Canada. Thirty-two   parasitoid wasp and fly species were recorded, 16 of which were found at   more than one location. We found that the mechanisms shaping   metacommunity structure changed over the course of a single season and   that community structure varied among sites. At early and late periods   in the season, we found that non-environmental structure, forest   structure, and likely inter-specific competition were the main   mechanisms influencing spatial variation in community structure. These   results suggest a competition-dispersal trade-off. In contrast, at the   middle period of the season, environmental filtering by forest structure   and stochastic events were found to influence community structure. This   period corresponds to the transition between early and late parasitoid   communities. Our findings on the role of environmental filtering and   forest structure support the idea that forest manipulations have the   potential to influence parasitoid populations and hence spruce budworm   outbreak dynamics as hypothesized by the enemies hypothesis. Moreover,   our study highlights the value of considering a multi-scale approach and   temporal variability of species interactions when characterizing the   multiple processes shaping spatial metacommunity structure, particularly   in continuous environments.",1635,NO,RO,,,

Population replacement requires a drive   mechanism to ensure the rapid spread of linked transgenes, the presence   of which may result in a fitness cost to carriers. Medea selfish genetic   elements have the feature that when present in a female, only offspring   that inherit the element survive, a behavior that can lead to spread.   Here, we derive equations that describe the conditions under which Medea   elements with a fitness cost will spread, and the equilibrium allele   frequencies are achieved. Of particular importance, we show that   whenever Medea spreads, the non-Medea genotype is driven out of the   population, and we estimate the number of generations required to   achieve this goal for Medea elements with different fitness costs and   male-only introduction frequencies. Finally, we characterize two   contexts in which Medea elements with fitness costs drive the non-Medea   allele from the population: an autosomal element in which not all   Medea-bearing progeny of a Medea-bearing mother survive, and an X-linked   element in species in which X/Y individuals are male. Our results   suggest that Medea elements can drive population replacement under a   wide range of conditions.",1636,NO,RO,,,

Therefore, for better ecosystem management, it is important to   understand how exotic species colonize and adapt to novel environments.   The threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) can be a good   vertebrate model system to explore the ecological and genetic mechanisms   of adaptation not only in natural populations, but also in non-native   populations. Although morphological changes have been documented in   several introduced populations of stickleback, little is known about the   dietary changes during colonization into novel environments. Here, we   investigated the morphological and dietary changes of exotic threespine   stickleback populations introduced into three Japanese crater lakes   (Lake Towada, Lake Kussharo, and Lake Shikotsu). Sticklebacks were   introduced into the crater lakes likely along with salmonids   transplanted for aquaculture. The stickleback population in Lake   Kussharo had multiple mitochondrial haplotypes and had larger phenotypic   variances than other crater lake stickleback populations that had only   one mitochondrial haplotype. Compilation of historical data on the   morphology and stomach contents of the Lake Towada stickleback   population showed that substantial shifts in body size and stomach   contents occurred after colonization. Some of these changes may be   related to an outbreak of the Schistocephalus parasite. These results   suggest that sticklebacks can change their morphology and trophic   ecology when they colonize novel environments. Therefore, extreme care   should be taken when salmonids are transported between watersheds for   aquaculture and that long-term monitoring of exotic species is essential   for ecosystem management. In addition, further genetic studies on   phenotypic changes in crater lake sticklebacks would help elucidate the   genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptation of exotic fishes to novel   environments.",1637,NO,RO,,,

For increased   understanding of such interactions, we evaluated the presence of major   fungal diseases by visual inspection, and content of phenolic compounds   by HPLC in leaves of five segregating black currant breeding   populations. Eight individual flavonols (e. g. quercetin-3-O-glucoside,   quercetin-3-O-rutinoside and kaempferol-malonylgucoside), three   flavan-3-ols (epigallocatechin, catechin and epicatechin) and two   chlorogenic acids (neochlorogenic acid and chlorogenic acid) were   significantly correlated to the leaf diseases.

They play an important role in aquatic   ecosystems, performing the tasks of decomposing organic matter, cycling   nutrients and forming the base of microbial food webs.

Bacterioplankton cells are usually less   abundant than in Lake Michigan and rarer than in more eutrophic Lake   Erie. Heterotrophic bacterial production ranges from 0.02 to 0.66 mg C   m(-3) h(-1) in the western arm of Lake Superior, which is generally   lower than in the other Laurentian Great Lakes.

Interaction   strengths between plants and arthropods varied within a calendar year;   being strongest in winter months (July and August), initiation of the   growth season (November) and peak growth season (February and March). It   was hypothesised that variation was caused by changing primary   productivity. The trophic composition of the arthropod community   supported this hypothesis as the ratio between primary consumers   (herbivores) and secondary consumers (predators and parasitoids) showed   patterns that coincided with periods of strong arthropod-plant   interactions. Patterns were explained by multiple theories linking plant   and arthropod diversity. It was concluded that arthropod assemblages are   closely linked to primary producers, the abiotic environment and   top-down trophic forces at different times of the year.

Food supply is an important limiting factor in most animal populations   and may have demographic consequences. Optimal foraging theory predicts   greater consumption of preferred prey and less diet diversity when food   is abundant, which may benefit key fitness parameters such as   productivity and survival. Nevertheless, the correspondence between   individual resource use and demographic processes in populations of   avian predators inhabiting large geographic areas remains largely   unexplored, particularly in complex ecosystems such as those of the   Mediterranean basin. Based on a long-term monitoring program of the diet   and demography of Bonelli's eagle Aquila fasciata in western Europe,   here we test the hypothesis that a predator's diet is correlated to its   breeding productivity and survival at both the territorial and   population levels, and ultimately to its population growth rate. At the   territorial level, we found that productivity increased with greater   consumption of European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, the Bonelli's   eagle's preferred prey, and pigeons, an important alternative prey for   this predator. The survival of territorial pairs was negatively affected   by higher diet diversity, which probably reflected the inability to find   sufficient high quality prey. Diet effects at the population level were   similar but more noticeable than at the territorial level, i.e. a   greater consumption of rabbits, together with lesser consumption of   small-to-medium avian species (other birds'; non-preferred prey),   increased productivity, while greater diet diversity and lower   consumption of rabbits was associated with reduced survival and   population growth rate. Overall, our study illustrates how the diet of a   predator species can be closely related to key individual vital rates,   which, in turn, leave a measurable fingerprint on population dynamics   within and among populations across large spatial scales.",1641,NO,RO,,,

In this paper, we draw   on a recent, high-profile PSF study to illustrate that certain widely   used experimental methods cannot reliably determine if PSFs occur. One   problem involves gathering soil samples adjacent to multiple   conditioning plants, mixing the samples and then growing phytometers in   the mixtures to test for PSFs. This mixed soil approach does not   establish that the conditioning plant being present caused the soil   biota to be present, the first step of a PSF. Also, soil mixing   approximates replacing raw data with averages prior to analysis, a move   certain to generate falsely precise statistical estimates. False   precision also results from sample sizes being artificially inflated   when phytometers are misinterpreted as experimental units. Plant biomass   ratios become another source of false precision when individual plant   values contribute to multiple ratio observations. Any one of these   common missteps can cause still living null hypotheses to be pronounced   dead, and risks of this increase with numbers of missteps. If soil   organisms truly structure plant communities, then null hypotheses   indicating otherwise will not survive proper testing.

We have studied inoculum production by   Fusarium using fungal biomass per unit wheat stubble, stem browning from   CR and the saprophytic fitness of Fusarium strains isolated from two   wheat varieties grown in 2007 and 2008 at ambient and elevated CO(2) in   free-air CO(2) enrichment (FACE) with or without irrigation and once in   a controlled environment. Fungal biomass, determined using primers for   fungal ribosomal 18s and the TRI5 gene, increased significantly at   elevated CO(2) in two of the three studies. Stem browning increased   significantly at elevated CO(2) in the 2007 FACE study. At elevated   CO(2) increased stem browning was not influenced by irrigation in a   susceptible variety but in a resistant variety stem browning increased   by 68\% without irrigation. Wheat variety was significant in regression   models explaining stem browning and Fusarium biomass but pathogen   biomass at the two CO(2) levels was not significantly linked to stem   browning. Fusarium isolates from ambient and elevated CO(2) did not   differ significantly in their saprophytic fitness measured by the rate   of colonization of wheat straw. We show that under elevated CO(2)   Fusarium inoculum in stubbles will be amplified from increased crop and   pathogen biomass while unimpeded saprophytic fitness will retain its   effectiveness. If resistant varieties cannot completely stop infection,   Fusarium will rapidly colonize stubble to further increase inoculum once   the crop is harvested.

Here we   investigate the rarely studied phenomenon of early-season crop   colonization by parasitoids and the relationship with the surrounding   landscape. We assessed parasitism of whiteflies by placing whitefly   infested cotton seedlings in remnant vegetation, arable land 25-125 m   from remnant vegetation, and arable land further than 400 m from remnant   vegetation. Twelve to twenty sentinel plants were exposed in a 25 x 25 m   grid pattern in plots in each habitat. The experiment was conducted at   18 locations across two landscapes and repeated three times in a 2-week   period in 2007 and 2008. Parasitism was observed during the first three   days after the introduction of the whitefly infested seedlings and was   in all cases caused by Encarsia spp. The mean number of parasitized   whitefly per plant was 0.106 +/- 0.025 and was highest on cotton plants   placed in remnant vegetation, declining with increasing distance from   remnant vegetation. A regression model with land use and meteorological   variables received more statistical support from the data than models   with only landscape and time period as factors. Parasitism levels were   influenced by the proportion of remnant vegetation, grassland, as well   as wind, temperature, dew point temperature and year. Early-season   colonization of whitefly infested seedlings by parasitoids was erratic   and characterized by large spatial (inter-plant and inter-plot) and   temporal variation. Our study confirms that remnant vegetation function   as reservoirs for parasitoids and that parasitoids can penetrate arable   fields beyond 125 m within 3 days. However, variation in the occurrence   of parasitism makes it difficult to predict parasitoid colonization at a   specific place and time. Therefore, field-based scouting for pests and   parasitoids is necessary, even in landscapes with a high biocontrol   potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1644,NO,RO,,,

The microorganisms may, however, also be   negatively affected if saprophagous animals do not avoid microbe-laden   resources but feed in the presence of microbial competitors. We   hypothesised that filamentous fungi compete with saprophagous insects,   whereby secondary metabolites provide a chemical shield against the   insect competitors.

Infestation of Drosophila breeding substrate with proliferating fungal   colonies caused graduated larval mortality that strongly depended on   mould species and colony age. Confrontation with conidiospores only, did   not result in significant changes in larval survival, suggesting that   insect death may not be ascribed to pathogenic effects. When confronted   with colonies of transgenic fungi that lack the ability to express the   global secondary metabolite regulator LaeA (Delta laeA), larval   mortality was significantly reduced compared to the impact of the wild   type strains. Yet, also in the. Delta laeA strains, inter-specific   variation in the influence on insect growth occurred. Competition with   Drosophila larvae impaired fungal growth, however, wild type colonies of   A. nidulans and A. flavus recovered more rapidly from insect competition   than the corresponding. Delta laeA mutants (not in A. fumigatus). Our   findings provide genetic evidence that toxic secondary metabolites   synthesised by saprotrophic fungi may serve as a means to combat insect   competitors. Variation in the ability of LaeA to control expression of   various secondary metabolite gene clusters might explain the observed   species-specific variation in Drosophila-Aspergillus competition.",1645,NO,RO,,,

However, studies of bacterial   communities associated with tropical rainforest tree root surfaces, or   rhizoplane, are lacking. Here, we analyzed the bacterial community of   root surfaces of four species of native trees, Agathis borneensis,   Dipterocarpus kerrii, Dyera costulata, and Gnetum gnemon, and nearby   bulk soils, in a rainforest arboretum in Malaysia, using 454   pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The rhizoplane bacterial   communities for each of the four tree species sampled clustered   separately from one another on an ordination, suggesting that these   assemblages are linked to chemical and biological characteristics of the   host or possibly to the mycorrhizal fungi present. Bacterial communities   of the rhizoplane had various similarities to surrounding bulk soils.   Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria were dominant   in rhizoplane communities and in bulk soils from the same depth (0-10   cm). In contrast, the relative abundance of certain bacterial lineages   on the rhizoplane was different from that in bulk soils: Bacteroidetes   and Betaproteobacteria, which are known as copiotrophs, were much more   abundant in the rhizoplane in comparison to bulk soil. At the genus   level, Burkholderia, Acidobacterium, Dyella, and Edaphobacter were more   abundant in the rhizoplane. Burkholderia, which are known as both   pathogens and mutualists of plants, were especially abundant on the   rhizoplane of all tree species sampled. The Burkholderia species present   included known mutualists of tropical crops and also known N fixers. The   host-specific character of tropical tree rhizoplane bacterial   communities may have implications for understanding nutrient cycling,   recruitment, and structuring of tree species diversity in tropical   forests.

Plant community productivity commonly increases with increasing plant   diversity, which is explained by complementarity among plant species in   resource utilization (complementarity effect), or by selection of   particularly productive plant species in diverse plant communities   (selection effect). Recent studies have also shown that soil biota can   drive the positive plant diversity-productivity relationship by   suppressing productivity more in low- than in high-diversity plant   communities. However, much remains unknown about whether soil fertility   plays a role in determining how soil biota affect plant   diversity-productivity relationships.   2. We hypothesized that under high soil fertility conditions, negative   soil biota effects dominate, which reduces plant monoculture biomass   more than that of high-diversity plant communities. Conversely, under   low soil fertility conditions, we hypothesized positive soil biota   effects dominate, which facilitates plant resource partitioning and   enhances community-level biomass in high-diversity plant communities.   Hence, we expected positive plant diversity-community productivity   relationships under low and high soil fertility conditions but caused by   different mechanisms. 3. We tested these hypotheses using woody   seedlings and set up plant assemblages with four species richness levels   (one, two, four and eight species), and grew them in sterilized and   unsterilized (sterilized soil + living soil inoculum) soils at two   nutrient levels (low versus high fertility).   4. We found that at high fertility negative soil biota effects dominated   and suppressed plant community biomass more in high-diversity plant   communities than in monocultures, resulting in reduced complementarity   effects of diverse plant communities and a non-significant plant species   richness-community biomass relationship in unsterilized soil. Whereas at   low fertility soil biota had net neutral to positive effects on plant   community biomass but the beneficial effects did not increase with   increasing plant species richness. Instead, soil biota neutrally   affected the positive plant species richness-community biomass   relationship, presumably due to non-specific effects of beneficial soil   biota.   5. Synthesis. Soil biota and soil fertility interactively determine   plant species richness-community biomass relationships. Moreover, soil   biota modulate the complementary resource use among plant species. These   findings suggest that environmental context plays an important role in   determining whether and how soil biota generate the   biodiversity-productivity relationship. Future studies would benefit   from revealing the mechanisms underlying the interactive effects of soil   biota, soil fertility, and plant diversity on ecosystem functioning.",1647,MAYBE,RO,maybe,effects of PP and non-PP not separable,

The   foundation tree species Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) is declining   due to infestation by the nonnative insect Adelges tsugae (hemlock   woolly adelgid). The decline and expected elimination of hemlock from   northeastern U.S. forests is changing forest structure, function, and   assemblages of associated species. We assessed 10 years of changes in   occupancy, detection probability, and relative abundance of two species   of terrestrial salamanders, Plethodon cinereus (eastern red-back   salamander) and Notopthalmus viridescens viridescens (eastern   red-spotted newt), to the experimental removal in 2005 of T. canadensis   at Harvard Forest. Salamanders were sampled under cover boards and using   visual encounter surveys before (2004) and after (2005, 2013, 2014)   canopy manipulations in replicate 0.81-ha plots. In 2004, occupancy of   P. cinereus was 35\% lower in stands dominated by T. canadensis than   that in associated mixed-hardwood control stands, whereas detection   probability and estimated abundance of P. cinereus were, respectively,   60\% and 100\% greater in T. canadensis stands. Estimated abundance of   N. v. viridescens in 2004 was 50\% higher in T. canadensis stands.   Removal of the T. canadensis canopy increased occupancy of P. cinereus   but significantly reduced its estimated detection probability and   abundance. Estimated abundance of N. v. viridescens also declined   dramatically after canopy manipulations. Our results suggest that ten   years after T. canadensis loss due to either the adelgid or pre-emptive   salvage logging, and 50-70 years later when these forests have become   mid-successional mixed deciduous stands, the abundance of these   salamanders likely will be <50\% of their abundance in current, intact   T. canadensis stands.

As the only known   obligate scavengers, vultures are uniquely adapted to a scavenging   lifestyle. Vultures' unique adaptations include soaring flight, keen   eyesight, and extremely low pH levels in their stomachs. Presently, 14   of 23 (61\%) vulture species worldwide are threatened with extinction,   and the most rapid declines have occurred in the vulture-rich regions of   Asia and Africa. The reasons for the population declines are varied, but   poisoning or human persecution, or both, feature in the list of nearly   every declining species. Deliberate poisoning of carnivores is likely   the most widespread cause of vulture poisoning. In Asia, Gyps vultures   have declined by >95\% due to poisoning by the veterinary drug   diclofenac, which was banned by regional governments in 2006. Human   persecution of vultures has occurred for centuries, and shooting and   deliberate poisoning are the most widely practiced activities.   Ecological consequences of vulture declines include changes in community   composition of scavengers at carcasses and an increased potential for   disease transmission between mammalian scavengers at carcasses. There   have been cultural and economic costs of vulture declines as well,   particularly in Asia. In the wake of catastrophic vulture declines in   Asia, regional governments, the international scientific and donor   communities, and the media have given the crisis substantial attention.   Even though the Asian vulture crisis focused attention on the plight of   vultures worldwide, the situation for African vultures has received   relatively little attention especially given the similar levels of   population decline. While the Asian crisis has been largely linked to   poisoning by diclofenac, vulture population declines in Africa have   numerous causes, which have made conserving existing populations more   difficult. And in Africa there has been little government support to   conserve vultures despite mounting evidence of the major threats. In   other regions with successful vulture conservation programs, a common   theme is a huge investment of financial resources and highly skilled   personnel, as well as political will and community support.",1649,NO,RO,,,

Demand recently has   increased for fruits for the herbal remedies market. Because only wild   saw palmettos are harvested, management strategies are needed to promote   flowering and fruiting. This study investigated effects of time since   growing season (April July) fires on flowering and fruiting of saw   palmetto ramets >= 54 cm in height, in 18 pine flatwoods or dry prairie   sites (six sites in three locations, burned in 1996, 1995, 1994, 1993,   1992, or before 1991) in central and southwest Florida from 1996 to   1999. We used repeated measures, linear mixed models to test for time   since fire effects on proportion of ramets flowering, proportion of   ramets fruiting, and fruit yield. Ranges of means among sites over all   years of the study for proportion of ramets flowering, proportion of   ramets fruiting, and fruit yield were 0 to 0.78, 0 to 0.72, and 0   kg.ha(-1) to 2 869 kg.ha(-1), respectively. Time since fire strongly   influenced flowering; highest probability of flowering occurred 1 yr   after burning, followed by an abrupt decrease 2 yr after burning, then a   gradual increase from 3 to 5 yr after fires (polynomial regression, P <   0.0001 for fixed effects). Probability of fruiting increased with   increasing time since fire (quadratic regression, P < 0.001 for fixed   effects), but fruit yields showed no pattern in response to time since   fire (P=0.916). The decrease in influence of fire from flowering through   fruit maturity presumably was caused by mortality from factors such as   caterpillar predation and fungal infection. To promote increased   flowering and fruit yields, we recommend that growing season burns be   conducted approximately every 5 yr.

Plant-soil feedbacks can influence the success of non-native plant   invasions. We investigated if these feedbacks and the underlying   invasion effects on soil microbes and nutrients depend on the species   composition of the invaded vegetation, and whether these effects are   related to differences in the invasibility of native plant communities.   2. We carried out a mesocosm experiment simulating the invasion of   Solidago gigantea into three wetland plant communities (Molinion,   Magnocaricion and Filipendulion), each composed of five plant species   but differing in productivity. To study plant-soil feedbacks, we used   different soil inoculum types from invaded and non-invaded field sites   of the corresponding communities and a reference site. Invasion success   was assessed by measuring the biomass of S. gigantea after three growing   seasons and by analysing soil properties several times during the   experiment.   3. Invasion success varied significantly among communities and soil   inoculum types. Solidago gigantea produced more biomass in the Molinion   than in the two more productive communities. In all three communities,   it exhibited a negative feedback upon itself, producing 31-46\% less   biomass when the substrate was inoculated with soil from a stand invaded   with S. gigantea.   4. The presence of S. gigantea did not influence total biomass in any   community nor Nand P availability in soil. However, it led to a decrease   in soil bacterial and an increase in soil fungal biomasses. These   changes were similar in the three communities and unrelated to the   biomass of S. gigantea biomass in the invaded communities.   5. Synthesis. The experimental comparison between effects of an invasive   plant species on soil properties in different native communities showed   similar effects despite pronounced differences in the ability of the   invasive species to grow in the different communities. In this system,   plant-soil interactions may thus affect invasion, but not explain   differences in the invasibility of different communities. The invasive   species increased soil fungal biomass, particularly in its own soil,   compared to native species and experienced a negative feedback,   suggesting that the course of its invasion might be affected by   species-specific soil pathogens.",1651,NO,RO,,,

Flueck,2009,Evolution of Forest Systems: the Role of Biogeochemical Cycles in   Determining Sustainable Forestry Practices,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,NA,NA,NA,"The exploitation of natural resources such as forests leads to   sustainable forest management (SFM). The key question is how to define   and parametrize ``sustainable use.'' Promoting forest use that   conserves spatial characteristics of forest landscapes and the structure   and composition of forest stands was proposed as a way of maintaining   elements of biodiversity such as species richness and genetic variation.   However, to establish the parameter space for sustainable forest use, it   is essential to consider the nutrient requirements of forest systems,   that is, plants and animals, the need for fertilizer application, and   the effects on biogeochemical cycles, a cornerstone of biological   evolution and, thus, biodiversity. The use of forest products is   inevitably tied to exporting biomass from those ecosystems because   products are used elsewhere, thus changing natural practically   steady-state ecosystems to open ones. Continued biomass export results   in soil acidification and nutrient removal. Among macronutrients,   phosphorus takes a key position, but several others have been shown to   be depleted in managed-forest systems. Micronutrients are more crucial   for forest-dwelling animals, particularly those nutrients that are only   essential to animals. Depletion of their reserves, selenium for   instance, through biomass export will not affect plants, and initial   subclinical effects on animals are difficult to detect. The generalized   effect may be reflected in changing rates of recruitment or disease   resistance, and thus ecosystem processes. Forest products and their   export reduces soil-nutrient reserves, and slash burning and water   runoff further add to cumulative losses of several minerals. Such   impacts from forest products need to be addressed, particularly for   mammals and their unique needs for several microelements. Biogeochemical   cycles disturbed by exporting forest products will affect plants and   animals and, therefore, ecosystems and their processes, and these   effects need to be incorporated in SFM designs.",1654,NO,RO,,,

We systematically evaluated   these factors to assist development of locally appropriate strategies to   mitigate disease risk. Wild dogs from 16 sites representing five   unconnected populations were examined for rabies virus, canine distemper   virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and Babesia spp.   exposure. Analyses revealed widespread exposure to viral pathogens, but   Babesia was never detected. Exposure to CDV was associated with   unprotected and protected-unfenced areas where wild dogs likely have a   high probability of domestic dog contact and, in the case of   protected-unfenced areas, likely reside amongst high wildlife densities.   Our findings also suggest that domestic dog contact may increase rabies   and coronavirus exposure risk. Therefore, domestic dogs may be a source   of CDV, rabies and coronavirus, while wildlife may also play an   important role in CDV transmission dynamics. Relatively high parvovirus   seroprevalence across land-use types suggests that it might persist in   the absence of spillover from domestic dogs. Should intervention be   needed to control pathogens in wild dogs, efforts to prevent rabies and   coronavirus exposure might be directed at reducing infection in the   presumed domestic dog reservoir through vaccination. If prevention of   CDV and parvovirus infections were deemed a management necessity,   control of disease in domestic dogs may be insufficient to reduce   transmission risks, and vaccination of wild dogs themselves may be the   optimal strategy.

Infection may lead to   the death of the host cell and release of viruses, to the elimination of   the viral genome through cellular defence mechanisms or the integration   of the viral genome with the host as a chromosomal or extrachromosomal   element. Here, we revisit this canonical view, inspired by recent   experimental findings in which the majority of target host cells can be   induced into a dormant state when exposed to either active or   deactivated viruses, even when viruses are present at low relative   titre. We propose that both the qualitative phenomena and the   quantitative timescales of dormancy induction are consistent with the   hypothesis that cellular physiology can be altered by contact on the   surface of host cells rather than strictly by infection. In order to   test this hypothesis, we develop and study a biophysical model of   contact-mediated dynamics involving virus particles and target cells. We   show how virus particles can catalyse cellular transformations among   many cells, even if they ultimately infect only one (or none).

In   plant-feeding aphids, secondary bacterial symbionts can have strong   fitness effects on the host, e.g. resistance to natural enemies or   fungal pathogens. We examined the secondary symbiont community in three   species of aphid, each feeding on a unique host plant across   experimental plots that varied in plant species richness.

In this study,   we mapped the distribution and abundance of host species for the spruce   budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) to facilitate landscape scale   planning and modeling of outbreak dynamics. We used multitemporal,   multi-seasonal Landsat data and 128 ground truth plots (and 120   additional validation plots) to map basal area (BA), for 6.4 million   hectares of forest in northern Minnesota and neighboring Ontario.   Partial least-squares (PLS) regression was used to determine   relationships between ground data and Landsat sensor data. Subsequently,   BA was mapped for all forests, as well as for two specific host tree   genera (Picea and Abies). These PLS regression analyses yielded   estimates for overall forest BA with an R-2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 4.67   m(2) ha(-1) (20\% of measured BA), white spruce relative BA with an R-2   of 0.88 (RMSE = 12.57 m(2) ha-(1) [20\% of measured]), and balsam fir   relative BA with an R-2 of 0.64 (RMSE=6.08 m(2) ha-(1) [33\% of   measured]). We also used this method to estimate the relative BA of   deciduous and coniferous species, each with R-2 values of 0.86 and RMSE   values of 9.89 m(2) ha(-1) (23\% of measured) and 9.78 m(2) ha-1 (16\%   of measured), respectively. Of note, winter imagery (with snow cover)   and shortwave infrared-based indices - especially the shortwave   infrared/visible ratio - strengthened the models we developed. Because   ground measurements were made largely in forest stands containing spruce   and fir, modeled results are not applicable to stands dominated by   non-target conifers such as pines and cedar. PLS regression has proven   to be an effective modeling tool for regional characterization of forest   structure within spatially heterogeneous forests using multi-temporal   Landsat sensor data.

Multicellular structures with stomata in Cuscuta are   represented by extrafloral nectaries (ENS), reported from the stems of   one Monogynella species, and stomatiferous protuberances (SPs), which   are non-secretory. These latter structures had been noted on the stems   of three Grammica species more than a century ago but entirely forgotten   until recently when similar, non-secretory SPs were reported on the   flowers of several new Grammica species. Here we study for the first   time: (1) the extent of occurrence, diversity and evolution of secretory   (ENs) and non-secretory (SPs) multicellular structures in Cuscuta, and   (2) the function of SPs. We undertook a character evolution study of ENs   and SPs on the stems and flowers of 136 Cuscuta taxa, and examined the   structure/ultrastructure of SPs. ENs are inferred as primitive and   characterize subg. Monogynella. SPs are derived in the remaining   subgenera; they are ubiquitous on the flowers of Cuscuta and   Pachystigma, but absent on their stems. Subgenus Grammica species   develop two functional types of stems during their life cycle:   vegetative, exploratory stems with very low stomata! densities (and no   SPs), and reproductive, haustorial stems with numerous SPs. Moreover, 24   species from nine clades of subg. Grammica have evolved morphologically   diverse floral SPs with systematic significance. To preliminarily   ascertain SP function, we determined in the field the water uptake of   Tithonia tubiformis plants parasitized or not by Cuscuta costaricensis,   a species with both stem and floral SPs, and the stomatal conductance of   dodder stems and flowers, as well as host leaves. Water uptake of   parasitized hosts was significantly higher compared to non-parasitized   plants, even after host leaves were removed, both during the day and   night. The increased water uptake of parasitized hosts and stomatal   conductance values suggest a transpiration role for the SPs, which is   also confirmed by their lacunar structure. Grammica species with floral   SPs grow in arid areas or characterized by a pronounced dry season   during flowering/fruiting, which suggests that SPs may have evolved to   stimulate the host water uptake during these phenophases.

The source of   this normally terrestrial fungus in marine ecosystems is perplexing, but   of interest to coral conservationists, since tracking sources of   pathogens provides one of the few avenues to limit pathogen spread.   Hypothesized inputs of A. sydowii include terrestrial deposits, marine   sources, and African dust. Windborne dust from Africa amounts to nearly   1 x 10(9) t yr(-1), much of which is deposited over the Caribbean   region. Several studies have examined the microbiota of African dust and   detected the presence of Aspergillus spp., although identifications were   only to the genus level. I used specific culture conditions to determine   whether this coral pathogen is present in 4 samples of airborne dust   from the Caribbean and Africa, and 3 sediment samples from Africa and   the Cape Verde Islands (eastern Atlantic). A diversity of fungi were   found, including 7 species of Aspergillus and related taxa. However,   none of the samples contained A. sydowii. The lack of A. sydowii in   airborne dust and sediment samples suggests that African dust is an   unlikely source of the marine pathogen A. sydowii.

The life-history   traits of L. fucensis differed from those generally expected for species   in fluctuating and unpredictable habitats, in that variation in survival   of recruits had the largest effect on population growth, while   perturbations in adult survival or fecundity had little influence.   However, rapid individual growth rates were also necessary to achieve   long-term population growth. The modeled stable stage distribution   adequately represented the dynamics of settler and recruit stages, but   did not match those of adult stages, in populations sampled from 3   different sites. This suggests that factors not accounted for within the   model, such as changing individual behaviour across life stages in   response to environmental stimuli, may be important in shaping the   structure of L. fucensis populations in different microhabitats. In   numerical experiments, density-dependent survival and growth of settlers   resulted in fluctuations in population growth rate and suppressed total   population size over time, Reproductive failure clue to parasitic   infection decreased local recruitment, but did not result in population   extinction. Faster growth rates allowed for population persistence under   greater levels of chronic disturbance.

To improve our understanding of the relationship between the pitcher   plant (Sarracenia purpurea) and the phytotelma community inhabiting its   leaves we built an exploratory, mechanistic model based on stochiometric   constraints on carbon and nitrogen associated with prey decomposition.   2. Our theoretical results suggest that the phytotelma community is   acting as a mineralizing system producing nitrogen for the plant. This   is confirmed by data collected in the field and in the literature, that   show the amount of nitrogen produced by the decomposition of prey is   sufficiently high to be considered as a major source of nitrogen for the   plant.   3. In our model, nitrogen yield is higher if the phytotelma community is   restricted to bacteria alone than when the full food web is present.   Nitrogen availability is negatively affected by bacterivores (rotifers   and protozoa mostly) and positively affected by a cascading effect of   mosquito larvae.   4. When sedimentation rate is high, mosquitoes have a global positive   effect on nitrogen production because they indirectly reduce the amount   of nitrogen lost through sedimentation more than they export nitrogen   through pupation. On the other hand, when sedimentation rate is low   there is a hump-shaped relationship between the uptake rate of   bacterivores by mosquito larvae and the nitrogen yield in the plant.   5. We conclude that plant-bacteria and plant-mosquito interactions are   predominantly mutualistic, whereas plant-bacterivore interactions are   predominantly parasitic. Our work also illustrates how ecosystem   properties (here nitrogen production by the phytotelma community) can be   understood as a function of trophic complexity and can be seen as a   product of selection at the scale of a community.",1665,NO,RO,,,

However, connecting pollution to disease spread remains   difficult, in part, because contaminants can simultaneously exert direct   and multi-generational effects on several host and parasite traits. To   address these challenges, we parametrized a model using a   zooplankton-fungus-copper system. In individual-level assays, we   considered three sublethal contamination scenarios: no contamination,   single-generation contamination (hosts and parasites exposed only during   the assays) and multi-generational contamination (hosts and parasites   exposed for several generations prior to and during the assays).   Contamination boosted transmission by increasing contact of hosts with   parasites. However, it diminished parasite reproduction by reducing the   size and life-span of infected hosts. Multi-generational contamination   further reduced parasite reproduction. The parametrized model predicted   that a single generation of contamination would enhance disease spread   (via enhanced transmission), whereas multi-generational contamination   would inhibit epidemics relative to unpolluted conditions (through   greatly depressed parasite reproduction). In a population-level   experiment, multi-generational contamination reduced the size of   experimental epidemics but did not affect Daphnia populations without   disease. This result highlights the importance of multi-generational   effects for disease dynamics. Such integration of models with   experiments can provide predictive power for disease problems in   contaminated environments.",1667,NO,RO,,,

Pesticides are   one such stressor that can have profound effects on aquatic communities   by directly affecting sensitive species and indirectly affecting other   species via trophic cascades, which can alter ecosystem function.   However, there is growing evidence that non-target species can evolve   increased resistance. When such species are important drivers of the   food web, then evolved resistance should help buffer communities from   the effects of pesticides. To examine this possibility, we cultured four   populations of the common zooplankton Daphnia pulex that we previously   demonstrated were either sensitive or resistant to a common insecticide   (i.e., chlorpyrifos) due to their proximity to agriculture. Using   outdoor mesocosms that contained identical aquatic communities of   phytoplankton, periphyton, and leopard frog tadpoles (Lithobates   pipiens), we manipulated four D. pulex populations and four insecticide   concentrations. As we monitored the communities for nearly 3 months, we   found that the insecticide caused direct mortality of D. pulex in   communities containing sensitive populations, and this led to a bloom of   phytoplankton. In contrast, the insecticide caused much less direct   mortality in communities containing resistant D. pulex populations, and   the trophic cascade was prevented under low to moderate insecticide   concentrations. Across all insecticide treatments, survivorship of   leopard frogs was approximately 72 \% in communities with resistant D.   pulex but only 35 \% in communities with sensitive D. pulex. To our   knowledge, this is one of the first studies to use naturally occurring   population variation in insecticide resistance to show that the   evolution of pesticide resistance in zooplankton can mitigate the   effects of insecticide-induced trophic cascades, and that this outcome   can have far-reaching community effects.",1668,NO,RO,,,

Litterfall samples   collected between 1996 and 2001 revealed that flowers and fruits were   significantly more abundant in N-treated plots, and an analysis of oak   tree abundance found significant variation both among and within plots.   Acorn samples collected during 2003 and 2004 (a mast and a postmast   year) were therefore analyzed using ANCOVA models that included an   estimate of oak tree abundance. This tree abundance estimate was the   only significant driver of increased acorn production during the mast   year, and in both years it was a significant factor on plots receiving   the highest levels of N. In the postmast year, acorn production was   increased in direct response to N-related factors other than tree   abundance. Our comparisons of control and N-treated plots for acorn   quality traits (e.g. rates of acorn damage, germination percentage,   seedling growth) revealed negligible or only transient differences.

In agroecosystems the performance   of (invasive) herbivores and their impacts on crops is of particular   concern. Scientists are presently challenged with making reliable   inferences on invader success, natural enemy performance and efficacy of   biological control, particularly in tropical agroecosystems. In this   study, we assess how trophic regulatory forces (bottom-up vs. top down)   influence the success of three globally important pests of cassava. We   examine the mealybug species (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) of differing   host breadth and invasion history: Phenacoccus manihoti, Paracoccus   marginatus, and Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi. Potted plant fertilizer   trials were combined with a regional survey in Vietnam, Laos and   Cambodia of 65 cassava fields of similar size and age, but with varying   soil fertility. Relative abundance of each mealybug invader was mapped   along a soil fertility gradient, and contrasted with site-specific   measures of parasitism. Potted plant trials revealed strong bottom-up   effects for P. manihoti, such that impacts of nitrogen and potassium   additions were propagated through to higher trophic levels and   substantially boost development and fitness of its specialist   parasitoid, Anctgyrus lopezi (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). Field surveys   indicate that mealybug performance is highly species-specific and   context-dependent. For example, field-level abundance of P.   jackbeardsleyi and P. marginatus, was related to measures of soil   fertility parameters, soil texture and plant disease incidence.   Furthermore, for P. manihoti, in-field abundance is equally associated   with soil texture (i.e., silt content). Principal component analysis   (PCA) and regression suggested that P. manihoti and P. marginatus are   disproportionately favored in low-fertility conditions, while P.   jackbeardsleyi prospers in settings with high organic carbon and   phosphorus. Parasitism of P. manihoti by A. lopezi varied greatly with   field and soil fertility conditions, and was highest in soils with   intermediate fertility levels and where management practices include the   addition of fertilizer supplements. Our characterization of the relative   performance of invasive mealybugs and strength of parasitism across   variable soil fertility conditions will help guide parasitoid release   programs and soil management practices that enhance mealybug biological   control.",1670,NO,RO,,,

Landscape   attributes influence patterns of movement and behaviour of animal hosts,   virus spread and survival, as well as land use practices. A multi-agent   simulation was developed to represent the spatial and temporal dynamics   of pathogens between human-livestock and wildlife interfaces at the   fringe of large wildlife conservation areas. The model represents the   three main elements associated with epidemics - populations, space, and   time - to simulate direct contacts between wildlife and livestock. The   dynamics of these populations emerge from interactions between agents   and the landscape. The model was calibrated to represent the   transmission of foot-and-mouth disease through direct contact at the   border of the Kruger National Park in South Africa. In the region,   African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) act as reservoirs of the virus and   spread the infection to domestic cattle bordering the park. We tested   the sensitivity of various factors influencing contact rate between   buffaloes and cattle, and thus the risk of foot-and-mouth disease   transmission. Results show that cattle-buffalo contacts mostly depend on   the range of displacements of cattle and buffaloes, as influenced by the   landscape configuration, and on the number of fence breakages multiplied   by the time between breakage and repair. Contacts take place not only   close to water-points but also in grazing areas, within an area up to 6   km from the fence. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1671,NO,RO,,,

Understanding these effects is a major   challenge since it is inherently difficult to measure and manipulate   highly diverse soil communities. Mathematical models may advance this   understanding by making the interplay of the various processes affecting   plant-soil interaction explicit and by quantifying the relative   importance of the factors involved. The aim of this paper is to provide   a complete analysis of a pioneering plant-soil feedback model developed   by Bever and colleagues (J Ecol 85: 561-573, 1997; Ecol Lett 2: 52-62,   1999; New Phytol 157: 465-473, 2003) to fully understand the range of   possible impacts of plant-soil feedbacks on plant communities within   this framework. We analyze this model by means of a new graphical method   that provides a complete classification of the potential effects of soil   communities on plant competition. Due to the graphical character of the   method, the results are relatively easy to obtain and understand. We   show that plant diversity depends crucially on two key parameters that   may be viewed as measures of the intensity of plant competition and the   direction and strength of plant-soil feedback, respectively. Our   analysis provides a formal underpinning of earlier claims that   plant-soil feedbacks, especially when they are negative, may enhance the   diversity of plant communities. In particular, negative plant-soil   feedbacks can enhance the range of plant coexistence by inducing   competitive oscillations. However, these oscillations can also   destabilize plant coexistence, leading to low population densities and   extinctions. In addition, positive feedbacks can allow locally stable   forms of plant coexistence by inducing alternative stable states. Our   findings highlight that the inclusion of plant-soil interactions may   fundamentally alter the predictions on the structure and functioning of   above-ground ecosystems. The scenarios presented in this study can be   used to formulate hypotheses about the ways soil community effects may   influence plant competition that can be tested with empirical studies.

A formalized   literature search in the ISI Web of Science shows that plant related   research on the effects of winter climate change is generally   underrepresented. Temperate regions in particular are rarely studied in   this respect, although the few existing studies imply strong effects of   winter climate change on species ranges, species compositions,   phenology, or frost injury. The generally positive effect of warming on   plant survival and production may be counteracted by effects such as an   increased frost injury of roots and shoots, an increased insect pest   risk, or a disrupted synchrony between plants and pollinators.

Understanding the relative effects of interacting climate parameters, as   well as a stronger consideration of short-term events and variability of   climatic conditions is urgent. With respect to plant response, it would   be particularly worthwhile to account for hidden players such as   pathogens, pollinators, herbivores, or fungal partners in   mycorrhization.",1676,NO,RO,,,

Plant-parasitic nematode communities associated with olive trees in   Morocco as a case study,BMC ECOLOGY,NA,NA,10.1186/s12898-016-0113-9,"Background: Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) are major crop pests. On   olive (Olea europaea), they significantly contribute to economic losses   in the top-ten olive producing countries in the world especially in   nurseries and under cropping intensification. The diversity and the   structure of PPN communities respond to environmental and anthropogenic   forces. The olive tree is a good host plant model to understand the   impact of such forces on PPN diversity since it grows according to   different modalities (wild, feral and cultivated olives). A wide soil   survey was conducted in several olive-growing regions in Morocco. The   taxonomical and the functional diversity as well as the structures of   PPN communities were described and then compared between non-cultivated   (wild and feral forms) and cultivated (traditional and high-density   olive cultivation) olives.   Results: A high diversity of PPN with the detection of 117 species and   47 genera was revealed. Some taxa were recorded for the first time on   olive trees worldwide and new species were also identified.   Anthropogenic factors (wild vs cultivated conditions) strongly impacted   the PPN diversity and the functional composition of communities because   the species richness, the local diversity and the evenness of   communities significantly decreased and the abundance of nematodes   significantly increased in high-density conditions. Furthermore, these   conditions exhibited many more obligate and colonizer PPN and less   persister PPN compared to non-cultivated conditions. Taxonomical   structures of communities were also impacted: genera such as Xiphinema   spp. and Heterodera spp. were dominant in wild olive, whereas harmful   taxa such as Meloidogyne spp. were especially enhanced in high-density   orchards.   Conclusions: Olive anthropogenic practices reduce the PPN diversity in   communities and lead to changes of the community structures with the   development of some damaging nematodes. The study underlined the PPN   diversity as a relevant indicator to assess community pathogenicity.   That could be taken into account in order to design control strategies   based on community rearrangements and interactions between species   instead of reducing the most pathogenic species.",1677,NO,RO,,,

Indirect   effects of mutualisms may have important implications for surrounding   ecosystems through changes in density, species composition, or behavior;   however, the latter has been difficult to quantify. In fish cleaning   mutualisms, cleaners benefit by removing and consuming ectoparasites   from clients, whereas clients benefit from a reduction in parasite load.   Cleaner fish are also thought to benefit from immunity to predation and   use tactile stimulation as a preconflict management strategy to   manipulate partners' decisions and to avoid being eaten by piscivorous   client fish. Here we show, using a laboratory experiment, that the   presence of cleaner fish resulted in nearby fish not involved in the   cleaner-client mutualism experiencing less aggression (chases) from   predatory clients. In addition, the rate that piscivorous clients chased   prey was negatively correlated with the amount of tactile stimulation   given to the predator by the cleaner. These data suggest that, in the   laboratory, the risk of aggression from predators toward nearby prey   fish was greatly reduced as a by-product of cleaner fish presence and   tactile stimulation of predators by cleaner fish.

Given that invasions may cause ecological   and economic damage and pose a major threat to biodiversity,   understanding the mechanisms behind invasion success is essential. Both   the release of non-native populations from natural enemies, such as   parasites, and the genetic diversity of these populations may play key   roles in their invasion success. We investigated the roles of parasite   communities, through enemy release and parasite acquisition, and genetic   diversity in the invasion success of the non-native bumblebee, Bombus   hypnorum, in the United Kingdom. The invasive B.hypnorum had higher   parasite prevalence than most, or all native congeners for two   high-impact parasites, probably due to higher susceptibility and   parasite acquisition. Consequently parasites had a higher impact on   B.hypnorum queens' survival and colony-founding success than on native   species. Bombus hypnorum also had lower functional genetic diversity at   the sex-determining locus than native species. Higher parasite   prevalence and lower genetic diversity have not prevented the rapid   invasion of the United Kingdom by B.hypnorum. These data may inform our   understanding of similar invasions by commercial bumblebees around the   world. This study suggests that concerns about parasite impacts on the   small founding populations common to re-introduction and translocation   programs may be less important than currently believed.",1680,NO,RO,,,

Although several functions such as resource and shelter are related to   plant species, the role of the floristic composition is not well   understood. Using a correlative approach, we analysed interactions   between plant functional groups of spontaneous field margin vegetation   and the regulation of crop herbivores. We further compared the influence   of the local plant community with that of landscape structure at   different scales (50-500 m). We used Brassica oleracea crop plants as   phytometers planted into field margins of 48 fields and observed   correlations of explanatory variables (vegetation, landscape) and   response variables (herbivore and natural enemy abundance, crop damage)   for two consecutive years (24 fields x year(-1)).   We observed significant positive and negative correlations between plant   functional groups and variables related to crop herbivore regulation. In   general, plant cover based-models provided a better fit than   diversity-based models. Entomophilous flowering plants providing nectar   showed a positive correlation to ladybird abundance and aphid parasitism   and a negative relationship with major crop plant damage caused by   leaf-chewing invertebrates. Cover and diversity of wild Brassicaceae   species were positively correlated with flea beetle damage and   abundance. Most correlations with plant functional groups remained   significant after fitting variables of landscape structure. The density   of semi natural habitats showed predominantly positive correlations to   crop herbivore regulation, whereas the density of crops was negatively   correlated. The number of significant relationships decreased from   natural enemy to herbivore abundance and to plant damage.   Our results demonstrate the relative importance of field margin   vegetation for crop herbivore regulation. The differential responses to   plant functional groups support the idea that designing specific plant   mixtures may improve biological control. Additional effects of landscape   variables suggest that a combination of local and landscape-scale   management is the most promising strategy to optimise this ecosystem   service.

On this   premise, the annual cycle of a naturally occurring host-pathogen system   was reconstructed by examining infection with and antibodies to avian   influenza virus along the flyway of a long-distance Arctic migrant, the   Svalbard-breeding pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus. A   highly-localized transmission period was identified in winter, in   contrast to the north-south decline expected from dabbling ducks,   indicating the dynamics of infection may differ among host species. In   spring, 63\% (95\% CI: 57.1, 68.9) of adults had detectable antibodies   to the nucleoprotein of avian influenza virus, compared to just 15\%   (95\% CI: 8.7, 23.4) of juveniles, suggesting inter-annual antibody   maintenance. Nevertheless, adult seroprevalence declined by   approximately 30\% from spring to late summer, indicating significant   seroreversion in the population. Integrating these findings in an   epidemiological model, detectable antibodies to nucleoprotein were   estimated to persist for just 343 days (95\% CI: 221, 607); considerably   shorter than for other wildlife diseases in long-lived bird species. The   investigation of wildlife diseases in migratory populations is an   inherently complex task, yet, by integrating disease incidence and   seroprevalence along a migratory flyway, our findings suggest that the   ecological interactions and life history of the host, as well as the   life-history of the pathogen, can influence the dynamics of infection   and host immune response.",1683,NO,RO,,,

The objective of this study was to determine the   effect of single or repeated glyphosate applications on microbial and K   properties of soils. A 54 day incubation study (Exp I) had a 3 x 5   factorial design with 3 soils (silt loam: fine, illitic, mesic Aeric   Epiaqualf) of similar physical and chemical characteristics, that varied   in long-term glyphosate applications (no, low, and high glyphosate field   treatments) and five glyphosate rates (0, 0.5x, 1 x, 2x, and 3x   recommended field rates applied once at time zero). A second 6 month   incubation study (Exp II) had a 3 x 3 factorial design with three soils   (as described above) and three rates of glyphosate (0, 1x, and 2x   recommended field application rates applied monthly). For each study   microbial properties [respiration; community structure measured by   ester linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) analysis and microbial   biomass K] and K fractions (exchangeable and non-exchangeable) were   measured periodically. For Exp I, glyphosate significantly increased   microbial respiration that was closely related to glyphosate application   rate, most notably in soils with a history of receiving glyphosate. For   Exp II, there was no significant effect of repeated glyphosate   application on soil microbial structure (EL-FAME) or biomass K. We   conclude that glyphosate: (1) stimulates microbial respiration   particularly on soils with a history of glyphosate application; (2) has   no significant effect on functional diversity (EL-FAME) or microbial   biomass K: and (3) does not reduce the exchangeable K (putatively   available to plants) or affect non-exchangeable K.

In the high-altitude whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis)   forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), white pine blister   rust (Cronartium ribicola) is an introduced fungal pathogen that is now   the principal cause of tree mortality in many locations. Although   blister rust eradication has failed in the past, there is nonetheless   substantial interest in monitoring the disease and its rate of   progression in order to predict the future impact of forest disturbances   within this critical ecosystem.   This study integrates data from five different field-monitoring   campaigns from 1968 to 2008 to create a blister rust infection model for   sites located throughout the GYE. Our model parameterizes the past rates   of blister rust spread in order to project its future impact on   high-altitude whitebark pine forests. Because the process of blister   rust infection and mortality of individuals occurs over the time frame   of many years, the model in this paper operates on a yearly time step   and defines a series of whitebark pine infection classes: susceptible,   slightly infected, moderately infected, and dead. In our analysis, we   evaluate four different infection models that compare local vs. global   density dependence on the dynamics of blister rust infection. We compare   models in which blister rust infection is: (1) independent of the   density of infected trees, (2) locally density-dependent, (3) locally   density-dependent with a static global infection rate among all sites,   and (4) both locally and globally density-dependent. Model evaluation   through the predictive loss criterion for Bayesian analysis supports the   model that is both locally and globally density-dependent. Using this   best-fit model, we predicted the average residence times for the four   stages of blister rust infection in our model, and we found that, on   average, whitebark pine trees within the GYE remain susceptible for 6.7   years, take 10.9 years to transition from slightly infected to   moderately infected, and take 9.4 years to transition from moderately   infected to dead.

Since rapidity of   phage adsorption is dependent on host density, while infection   productivity is a function of host physiological status, we hypothesized   that marine particles are sites of elevated phage production. In the   present study, organic-matter-rich agarose beads and a marine phage-host   pair (Cellulophaga sp., Phi S(M)) were used as a model system to examine   whether bacterial colonization of particles increases phage production.   While no production of phages was observed in plain seawater, the   presence of beads enhanced attachment and growth of bacteria, as well as   phage production. This was observed because of extensive lysis of   bacteria in the presence of beads and a subsequent increase in phage   abundance both on beads and in the surrounding water. After 12 h,   extensive phage lysis reduced the density of attached bacteria; however,   after 32 h, bacterial abundance increased again. Reexposure to phages   and analyses of bacterial isolates suggested that this regrowth on   particles was by phage-resistant clones. The present demonstration of   elevated lytic phage production associated with model particles   illustrates not only that a marine phage has the ability to successfully   infect and lyse surface-attached bacteria but also that acquisition of   resistance may affect temporal phage-host dynamics on particles. These   findings from a model system may have relevance to the distribution of   phage production in environments rich in particulate matter (e.g., in   coastal areas or during phytoplankton blooms) where a significant part   of phage production may be directly linked to these nutrient-rich ``hot   spots.''.",1691,NO,RO,,,

We propose   to develop such a tool based on a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that   capitalises on the service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm. The   modelling framework around the DSL is composed of a model building   environment, a code generator and compiler, and a program execution   platform. The DSL introduces five language elements (entity, service,   relation, scenario and datafacer) that can be combined to offer a wide   range of possibilities for modelling in space and time at different   scales. When developing a model, model parts are either built using the   DSL or taken from libraries of previously built ones, and adapted to the   specific model. The practical usage of the DSL is illustrated first with   the Lotka-Volterra model, and then with a landscape modelling experiment   on the spread of a mosquito-borne disease in the Sahelian region of West   Africa. An interesting characteristic of this approach is the   possibility of adding new elements into an existing model, and replacing   others with more appropriate ones, thus allowing potentially complex   models to be built from simpler parts.

We experimentally removed arthropods, foliar   fungi and soil fungi from the longest-running plant diversity   experiment. We found that fungi and arthropods removed a constant, large   proportion of biomass leading to a greater reduction of total biomass in   high diversity plots. As a result, the effect of diversity on measured   plant productivity was much higher in the absence of fungi and   arthropods. Thus, diversity increases productivity more than reported in   previous studies that did not control for the effects of heterotrophic   consumption.",1694,NO,RO,,,

Despite   recent observational, experimental, and modeling studies suggesting   increased vulnerability of trees to hotter drought and associated pests   and pathogens, substantial debate remains among research, management and   policy-making communities regarding future tree mortality risks. We   summarize key mortality-relevant findings, differentiating between those   implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence   suggesting lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated   [CO2] and increased water-use efficiency; observed and modeled   increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in   woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological,   morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks;   and potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent   studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to   negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks.   Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising   background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency,   intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as   inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from   die-off; and wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten   contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have   not been discussed collectively. We also present a set of global   vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts   eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3)   atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature   during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought,   consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more   frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming,   increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6)   mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest   recovery. These high-confidence drivers, in concert with research   supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall   viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We surmise that   mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties   in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events. Given the   profound ecological and societal implications of underestimating global   vulnerability to hotter drought, we highlight urgent challenges for   research, management, and policy-making communities.",1697,NO,RO,,,

The ability of a species or ecosystem to persist after a   stochastic threat is strongly related to the extent and spatial pattern   of its geographical distribution. Consequently, protocols for assessing   risks to biodiversity typically include geographic range size criteria   for assessing risks from stochastic threats. However, owing in part to   the rarity of such events in nature, the metrics for assessing risk   categories have never been tested. In this study, we investigate the   performance of alternative range size metrics, including the two most   widely used, extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), as   predictors of ecosystem collapse in landscapes subject to stochastic   threats.   MethodsWe developed a spatially explicit stochastic simulation model to   investigate the impacts of four threat types on a dataset of 1350   simulated geographic distributions of varying pattern and size. We   empirically estimated collapse probability in response to each threat   type and evaluated the ability of a set of spatial predictors to predict   risk.   ResultsThe probability of ecosystem collapse increased rapidly as range   size declined. While AOO and EOO were the most important predictors of   collapse risk for the three spatially explicit threats included in our   model (circle, swipe and cluster), core area, patch density and mean   patch size were better predictors for edge effect threats.   Main conclusionsOur study is the first to quantitatively assess the   range size metrics employed in biodiversity risk assessment protocols.   We show that the current methods for measuring range size are the best   spatial metrics for estimating risks from stochastic threats.

Mistletoes are generally thought not to rely on   nutrient resorption; being xylem-tapping parasites, they instead derive   the nutrients required for new growth from their host plant, at little   or no cost. We measured nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) resorption in 18   parasitic mistletoe-host species pairs distributed across three sites   with notably low-P soil, also quantifying relationships with leaf   lifespan (LL) and specific leaf area (SLA). There was little or no   evidence of N, Ca or Mg resorption. By contrast, on average similar to   30\% of P and similar to 20\% of K were resorbed prior to leaf fall.   Longer LL in mistletoes was associated with lower N and P concentrations   in mistletoes and in host leaves. We provide evidence that, even though   mistletoes are relatively inefficient in terms of nutrient resorption   compared to non-parasite species, on low-P soils their ecological and   evolutionary strategies for conserving phosphorous involve modulation of   both leaf lifespan and P concentration in senesced leaves.",1700,NO,RO,,,

Leaf litter subsidies are important resources for aquatic consumers   like tadpoles and snails, causing bottom-up effects on wetland   ecosystems. Recent studies have shown that variation in litter   nutritional quality can be as important as litter quantity in driving   these bottom-up effects. Resource subsidies likely also have indirect   and trait-mediated effects on predation and parasitism, but these   potential effects remain largely unexplored.   2. We generated predictions for differential effects of litter nutrition   and secondary polyphenolic compounds on tadpole (Lithobates sylvatica)   exposure and susceptibility to Ribeiroia ondatrae, based on ecological   stoichiometry and community-ecology theory. We predicted direct and   indirect effects on key traits of the tadpole host (rates of growth,   development and survival), the trematode parasite (production of the   cercaria infective stages) and the parasite's snail intermediate host   (growth and reproduction).   3. To test these predictions, we conducted a large-scale mesocosm   experiment using a natural gradient in the concentrations of nutrients   (nitrogen) and toxic secondary compounds (polyphenolics) of nine leaf   litter species. To differentiate between effects on exposure vs.   susceptibility to infection, we included multiple infection experiments   including one with constant per capita exposure.   4. We found that increased litter nitrogen increased tadpole survival,   and also increased cercaria production by the snail intermediate hosts,   causing opposing effects on tadpole per capita exposure to trematode   infection. Increased litter polyphenolics slowed tadpole development,   leading to increased infection by increasing both their susceptibility   to infection and the length of time they were exposed to parasites.   5. Based on these results, recent shifts in forest composition towards   more nitrogen-poor litter species should decrease trematode infection in   tadpoles via density-and trait-mediated effects on the snail   intermediate hosts. However, these shifts also involve increased   abundance of litter species with high polyphenolic levels, which should   increase trematode infection via trait-mediated effects on tadpoles.   Future studies will be needed to determine the relative strength of   these opposing effects in natural wetland communities.

In Yellowstone National Park, river otters Lontra   canadensis depend on native cutthroat trout as prey. However, nonnative   lake trout and whirling disease have significantly reduced the abundance   of these native fish in the park's largest body of water, Yellowstone   Lake. We studied the demographic and behavioral responses of otters to   declining cutthroat trout on Yellowstone Lake and its tributaries. From   2002-2008, we monitored otter activity at latrine (scentmarking) sites,   collected scat for prey identification, and used individual genotypes   from scat and hair samples to evaluate survival and abundance with   capture-recapture methods. Otter activity at latrines decreased with   declines in cutthroat trout, and the prevalence of these fish in otter   scat declined from 73\% to 53\%. Cutthroat trout numbers were the best   predictor of temporal variation in apparent survival, and mean annual   survival for otters was low (0.72). The density of otters in out study   area (1 otter per 13.4 km of shoreline) was also low, and evidence of a   recent genetic bottleneck suggests that otter abundance might have   declined prior to our study. River otters in and around Yellowstone Lake   appear to be responding to reductions in cutthroat trout via changes in   distribution, diet, and possibly survival and abundance.

Here, we report evidence for two costs of   reproduction that may influence survival in wild female baboons-injury   risk and delayed wound healing. Based on 29 years of observations in the   Amboseli ecosystem, Kenya, we found that wild female baboons experienced   the highest risk of injury on days when they were most likely to be   ovulating. In addition, lactating females healed from wounds more slowly   than pregnant or cycling females, indicating a possible trade-off   between lactation and immune function.

This article   presents the first multi-species, multi-country, single-crop impact   assessment of parasitic weeds in Africa. A systematic search of public   international and national herbaria and the scientific literature was   conducted to collect all available data on the regional distribution,   incidences and related yield losses of the most important parasitic   weeds in rice. Herbaria specimens were geo-referenced and these   coordinates were overlapped with rain-fed rice areas. Probabilistic   diffusion waves of parasitic weeds were generated to derive most likely   incidence values. Estimates from this spatial analysis were then   combined with secondary data from the literature into a stochastic   impact assessment model to generate a confidence interval of the likely   economic impact per country and for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.   Rhamphicarpa fistulosa occurs in at least 36 African countries, 28 of   which produce rice in rain-fed lowlands where this species thrives.   Striga hermonthica is found in at least 32 countries, Striga asiatica in   at least 44 and S. aspera in at least 17. A total of 50 countries have   at least one of these three species of Striga, 31 of which produce rice   in the rain-fed uplands where these species can be encountered.

Pacific salmon and steelhead once contributed large amounts of   marine-derived carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to freshwater ecosystems   in the Pacific Northwest of the United States of America (California,   Oregon, Washington and Idaho). Declines in historically abundant   anadromous salmonid populations represent a significant loss of   returning nutrients across a large spatial scale. Recently, a   manufactured salmon carcass analogue was developed and tested as a safe   and effective method of delivering nutrients to freshwater and linked   riparian ecosystems where marine-derived nutrients have been reduced or   eliminated.   2. We compared four streams: two reference and two treatment streams   using salmon carcass analogue(s) (SCA) as a treatment. Response   variables measured included: surface streamwater chemistry; nutrient   limitation status; carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes; periphyton   chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass (AFDM); macroinvertebrate density   and biomass; and leaf litter decomposition rates. Within each stream,   upstream reference and downstream treatment reaches were sampled 1 year   before, during, and 1 year after the addition of SCA.   3. Periphyton chlorophyll a and AFDM and macroinvertebrate biomass were   significantly higher in stream reaches treated with SCA. Enriched stable   isotope (delta N-15) signatures were observed in periphyton and   macroinvertebrate samples collected from treatment reaches in both   treatment streams, indicating trophic transfer from SCA to consumers.   Densities of Ephemerellidae, Elmidae and Brachycentridae were   significantly higher in treatment reaches. Macroinvertebrate community   composition and structure, as measured by taxonomic richness and   diversity, did not appear to respond significantly to SCA treatment.   Leaf breakdown rates were variable among treatment streams:   significantly higher in one stream treatment reach but not the other.   Salmon carcass analogue treatments had no detectable effect on measured   water chemistry variables.   4. Our results suggest that SCA addition successfully increased   periphyton and macroinvertebrate biomass with no detectable response in   streamwater nutrient concentrations. Correspondingly, no change in   nutrient limitation status was detected based on dissolved inorganic   nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus ratios (DIN/SRP) and   nutrient-diffusing substrata experiments. Salmon carcass analogues   appear to increase freshwater productivity.   5. Salmon carcass analogues represent a pathogen-free nutrient   enhancement tool that mimics natural trophic transfer pathways, can be   manufactured using recycled fish products, and is easily transported;   however, salmon carcass analogues should not be viewed as a replacement   for naturally spawning salmon and the important ecological processes   they provide.",1707,NO,RO,,,

We simultaneously   investigated the relative importance of the viral and heterotrophic   nanoflagellate (HNF) grazing-induced prokaryotic mortality in   bathypelagic waters by means of dilution experiments performed on   samples collected at 1500 m depth from the Atlantic Ocean to the Eastern   Mediterranean Sea. Prokaryotic abundance (range: 1.4 to 8.9 x 10(4)   cells ml(-1)), although different from one station to another, was on   average not significantly different among biogeographic regions. The   potential predators of prokaryotes (viruses, HNF and microzooplankton)   followed a similar spatial pattern. Viruses were responsible for an   important fraction of prokaryotic mortality (on average 13.4\% d(-1)).   Dilution experiments carried out to estimate the potential predation of   HNF suggested a high effect on prokaryotic abundance. However, since the   latter experiments also include the effect of viruses on prokaryotes,   when this factor was disentangled from the overall mortality, the   potential rates of HNF predation on prokaryotes (on average 49.5\%) were   ca. 4 times higher than the effect due to viral infections. Conversely   to patterns of distribution, the relative importance of virus-mediated   mortality vs. HNF predation changed significantly among different   regions. Results should be treated with caution due to the intrinsic   difficulty in reproducing experimentally natural deep-sea conditions,   but they permit disentangling of the relative effect of viruses and HNF   on prokaryotes and compare the potential predatory control in different   biogeographic regions.",1708,NO,RO,,,

Food web structure was altered by habitat fragmentation, with different   metrics being affected depending on interaction type, and with all   changes being driven by the reduced size of networks in smaller   fragments. Only connectance varied in both quantitative and qualitative   analyses, being negatively related to area. In addition, the   interactions were represented by proper successive subsets, modulated   mainly by resource availability (plantherbivore) or consumer   specialization (hostparasitoid), as forest size decreased.

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will   contribute to understanding human effects on biogeochemical cycles from   local to continental scales. The broad NEON biogeochemistry measurement   design focuses on measuring atmospheric deposition of reactive mineral   compounds and CO2 fluxes, ecosystem carbon (C) and nutrient stocks, and   surface water chemistry across 20 eco-climatic domains within the United   States for 30 yr. Herein, we present the rationale and plan for the   ground-based measurements of C and nutrients in soils and plants based   on overarching or high-level requirements agreed upon by the National   Science Foundation and NEON. The resulting design incorporates early   recommendations by expert review teams, as well as recent input from the   larger natural sciences community that went into the formation and   interpretation of the requirements, respectively. NEON's efforts will   focus on a suite of data streams that will enable end-users to study and   predict changes to biogeochemical cycling and transfers within and   across air, land, and water systems at regional to continental scales.   At each NEON site, there will be an initial, one-time effort to survey   soil properties to 1 m (including soil texture, bulk density, pH,   baseline chemistry) and vegetation community structure and diversity. A   sampling program will follow, focused on capturing long-term trends in   soil C, nitrogen (N), and sulfur stocks, isotopic composition (of C and   N), soil N transformation rates, phosphorus pools, and plant tissue   chemistry and isotopic composition (of C and N). To this end, NEON will   conduct extensive measurements of soils and plants within stratified   random plots distributed across each site. The resulting data will be a   new resource for members of the scientific community interested in   addressing questions about long-term changes in continental-scale   biogeochemical cycles, and is predicted to inspire further process-based   research.",1711,NO,RO,,,

In the present study, we used   a secondary compost process to re-use the compost products, and   evaluated the effect of secondary compost products (SCP) on tomato   bacterial wilt in three field trials. The results showed that SCP   application had great potential for the control of tomato bacterial   wilt. Compared with the control (local conventional cultivation), SCP   application decreased the disease incidence by 32-81\% and increased   fruit yields by 59-95\% across the three trials. Irrespective of   treatment, significant correlations were found between Ralstonia   solanacearum populations and total nitrogen, soil organic carbon and   NO3--N contents.

The results indicate that the   enhancement of soil suppressiveness against R. solanacearum by SCP   application was likely due to the alteration of microbial community   structure and increased competitive ability of beneficial microorganisms   with pathogens.

Waterfowl are key players in ecological processes in   wetlands and surrounding habitats through predator-prey interactions and   their transportation of nutrients and other organisms. Understanding the   drivers of their movement behaviour is crucial to predict how   environmental changes affect their role in ecosystem functioning.   Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos) are the most abundant duck species   worldwide and important dispersers of aquatic invertebrates, plants and   pathogens like avian influenza viruses. By GPS tracking of 97 mallards   in four landscape types along a gradient of wetland availability, we   identified patterns in their daily movement behaviour and quantified   potential effects of weather conditions and water availability on the   spatial scale of their movements.   Results: We demonstrate that mallard movement patterns were highly   predictable, with regular commuting flights at dusk and dawn between a   fixed day roost and one or several fixed nocturnal foraging sites,   linked strongly to surface water. Wind and precipitation hardly affected   movement, but flight distances and home range sizes increased when   temperatures dropped towards zero. Flight distances and home range sizes   increased exponentially with decreasing availability of freshwater   habitat. Total shoreline length and the number of water bodies in the   landscape surrounding the roost were the best predictors of the spatial   scale of daily mallard movements.   Conclusions: Our results show how mallards may flexibly adjust the   spatial scale of their movements to wetland availability in the   landscape. This implies that mallards moving between discrete habitat   patches continue to preserve biotic connectivity in increasingly   fragmented landscapes. The high predictability of mallard movement   behaviour in relation to landscape features makes them reliable   dispersal vectors for organisms to adapt to, and allows prediction of   their ecological role in other landscapes.",1713,NO,RO,,,

Microplastic fibers (e.g., synthetic fabrics) and pellets (e.g.,   abrasives in personal care products) are abundant in wastewater   treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and can serve as a point source of   microplastic in rivers. The buoyancy, hydrophobic surface, and long   transport distance of microplastic make it a novel substrate for the   selection and dispersal of unique microbial assemblages. We measured   microplastic concentration and bacterial assemblage composition on   microplastic and natural surfaces upstream and downstream of WWTP   effluent sites at nine rivers in Illinois, United States. Microplastic   concentration was higher downstream of WWTP effluent outfall sites in   all but two rivers. Pellets, fibers, and fragments were the dominant   microplastic types, and polymers were identified as polypropylene,   polyethylene, and polystyrene. Mean microplastic flux was 1,338,757   pieces per day, although the flux was highly variable among nine sites   (min = 15,520 per day, max = 4,721,709 per day). High-throughput   sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed bacterial assemblage composition was   significantly different among microplastic, seston, and water column   substrates. Microplastic bacterial assemblages had lower taxon richness,   diversity, and evenness than those on other substrates, and microplastic   selected for taxa that may degrade plastic polymers (e.g., Pseudomonas)   and those representing common human intestinal pathogens (e.g.,   Arcobacter). Effluent from WWTPs in rivers is an important component of   the global plastic ``lifecycle,'' and microplastic serves as a novel   substrate that selects and transports distinct bacterial assemblages in   urban rivers.

Plants form mutualistic symbioses with a variety of microorganisms   including endophytic fungi that live inside the plant and cause no overt   symptoms of infection. Some endophytic fungi form defensive mutualisms   based on the production of bioactive metabolites that protect the plant   from herbivores in exchange for a protected niche and nutrition from the   host plant. Key elements of these symbioses are vertical transmission of   the fungus through seed of the host plant, a narrow host range, and   production of bioactive metabolites by the fungus.   2. Grasses frequently form symbioses with endophytic fungi belonging to   the family Clavicipitaceae. These symbioses have been studied   extensively because of their significant impacts on insect and mammalian   herbivores. Many of the impacts are likely due to the production of four   classes of bioactive alkaloids - ergot alkaloids, lolines,   indole-diterpenes and peramine-that are distributed in different   combinations among endophyte taxa.   3. Several legumes, including locoweeds, are associated with a toxic   syndrome called locoism as a result of their accumulation of   swainsonine. Species in two genera were recently found to contain   previously undescribed endophytic fungi (Undifilum spp., family   Pleosporaceae) that are the source of that toxin. The fungi are strictly   vertically transmitted and have narrow host ranges.   4. Some plant species in the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae) also   form symbioses with endophytic fungi of the Clavicipitaceae that produce   ergot alkaloids and, perhaps in at least one case, lolines. Other   species in this plant family form symbioses with undescribed fungi that   produce swainsonine. The swainsonine-producing endophytes associated   with the Convolvulaceae are distinct from the Undifilum spp. associated   with locoweeds and the Clavicipitaceous fungi associated with   Convolvulaceae.   5. In the establishment of vertically transmitted symbioses, fungi must   have entered the symbiosis with traits that were immediately useful to   the plant. Bioactive metabolites are likely candidates for such   pre-adapted traits which were likely useful to the free-living fungi as   well. With future research, vertically transmitted fungi from diverse   clades with narrow host ranges and that produce bioactive compounds are   likely to be found as important mutualists in additional plants.",1716,NO,RO,,,

When there are few between-subpopulation   contacts for the duration of a disease event, transmission becomes   localized to subpopulations. The number of per capita infectious   contacts approaches the subpopulation size as pathogen infectiousness   increases. Here, we illustrate that this is the case during epidemics of   highly infectious pneumonia in bighorn lambs (Ovis canadensis). We   classified individually marked bighorn ewes into disjoint seasonal   subpopulations, and decomposed the variance in lamb survival to weaning   into components associated with individual ewes, subpopulations,   populations and years. During epidemics, lamb survival varied   substantially more between ewe-subpopulations than across populations or   years, suggesting localized pathogen transmission. This pattern of lamb   survival was not observed during years when disease was absent.   Additionally, group sizes in ewe-subpopulations were independent of   population size, but the number of ewe-subpopulations increased with   population size. Consequently, although one might reasonably assume that   force of infection for this highly communicable disease scales with   population size, in fact, host social behaviour modulates transmission   such that disease is frequency-dependent within populations, and some   groups remain protected during epidemic events.",1717,NO,RO,,,

We analyzed histopathological data from annual shellfish   disease monitoring from 1988 to 2006 to quantify prevalence of B.   ostreae in flat oyster stocks of the marine Lake Grevelingen. In   addition, we estimated prevalence of B. ostreae on a monthly basis with   field surveys in 2003. The parasite was detected with PCR, using   specific primers for B. ostreae. Prevalence of B. ostreae was analyzed   relative to O. edulis density, biomass and a range of environmental   parameters. B. ostreae was detected in flat oysters throughout the year   with a higher prevalence in spring than in autumn, possibly due to   termination of spawning and the onset of oyster growth in autumn.   Although B. ostreae was detected in all oyster weight classes,   prevalence was highest in the largest oysters in spring and declined   disproportionately in autumn, possibly due to high mortality of large   oysters before autumn, suggesting that prevalence depends on oyster age.   Parasite prevalence was independent of oyster density and total biomass,   but appeared to be higher after a warm autumn. Abundance of the flat   oyster (infected or non-infected with B. ostreae) was negatively related   to the temperature of the preceding period, suggesting that mortality in   flat oysters increased at higher water temperatures. Furthermore, O.   edulis appeared to be more susceptible to B. ostreae after years with   lower food availability and lower salinities (<29.5).

Here we used aquaria and field experiments to   determine if feeding on BBD lesions by corallivorous fishes influences   disease progression rates. Although selective predation on lesions was   observed in both controlled laboratory experiments and field-based   observations, we found no evidence that fish feeding either reduced or   enhanced progression rates of BBD. Variability in disease progression   rates in the field was explained by variation among coral colonies   (24.46\%) and among sample days (37.77\%) rather than by predation   treatment (< 0.1\%). Also, disease progression rate was significantly   correlated with the width of the disease band. This suggests that   properties of the disease band, potentially the complexity of the   microbial community forming the band, influence rates of tissue loss.

Assessment of insect community   composition, combined with gut content analyses, was used to generate   periphyton-insect food webs for a Panamanian stream, both pre- and   post-amphibian decline. We then used network analysis to assess the   effects of amphibian declines on food web structure. Although 48\% of   consumer taxa, including many insect taxa, were lost between pre- and   post-amphibian decline sampling dates, connectance declined by less than   3\%. We then quantified the resilience of food web structure by   calculating the number of expected cascading extirpations from the loss   of tadpoles. This analysis showed the expected effects of species loss   on connectance and linkage density to be more than 60\% and 40\%,   respectively, than were actually observed. Instead, new trophic linkages   in the post-decline food web reorganized the food web topology, changing   the identity of ``hub'' taxa, and consequently reducing the effects of   amphibian declines on many food web attributes. Resilience of food web   attributes was driven by a combination of changes in consumer diets,   particularly those of insect predators, as well as the appearance of   generalist insect consumers, suggesting that food web structure is   maintained by factors independent of the original trophic linkages.",1721,NO,RO,,,

We were interested in   discovering whether deterministic or stochastic factors dominate   nematode community variation. We used a novel metagenetic approach to   investigate variation in nematode community structure in the Fynbos   vegetation of South Africa. We compared 23 samples of soil nematode   communities from five different Fynbos landscapes. Nematode DNA was   454-pyrosequenced for the 18S rRNA gene. We investigated the community   structure, diversity, and the relative role of both deterministic   (niche-based) and neutral processes may play in delimiting the nematode   phylogenetic community structure in different Fynbos vegetation types.   Nematode diversity showed no relationship to any measured soil   parameter. The phylogenetic signal showed that more closely related   types of nematodes in the Fynbos tended to co-occur more often than   would be expected by chance, demonstrating that (a) closely related   lineages occupy similar niches spatially and (b) community variation is   influenced more by determinism than stochasticity. The standardised beta   mean nearest taxon distance (ses.beta MNTD) index showed no association   with vegetation type. Both ses.NTI (nearest taxon index) and ses.beta   MNTD deviated significantly from null models, indicating that   deterministic processes were important in the assembly of nematode   communities. Furthermore, at local scale, the ses.NTI was significantly   higher than null expectations, indicating that co-occurrence of related   nematode lineages is determined by the differences in environmental   conditions across the sites. We conclude that in the Fynbos there is   niche overlap between closely related types of nematodes, that nematode   speciation tends to occur conservatively into closely related niches,   and that the phylogenetic community structure reveals that deterministic   (rather than stochastic) processes are more important in delimiting the   community assembly.",1722,NO,RO,,,

The   tripartite mutualism between fungus-growing ants, their fungal   cultivars, and antibiotic-producing bacteria exemplifies symbiotic   complexity. Here we reveal how black yeasts, newly described symbionts   of the ant microbe system, compromise the efficiency of bacteria-derived   antibiotic defense in fungus-growing ants. We found that symbiotic black   yeasts acquire nutrients from the ants' bacterial mutualist, and   suppress bacterial growth. Experimental manipulation of ant colonies and   their symbionts shows that ants infected with black yeasts are   significantly less effective at defending their fungus garden from   Escovopsis, a prevalent and specialized pathogen. The reduction of   mutualistic bacterial biomass on ants, likely caused by black yeast   symbionts, apparently reduces the quantity of antibiotics available to   inhibit the garden pathogen. Success of the ant fungal mutualism is   directly dependent on fungus garden health. Thus our finding that black   yeasts compromise the ants' ability to deal with the garden parasite   indicates that it is an integral component of the symbiosis.

Symbioses   with algae of clades A and B released ca. 30-40\% of fixed carbon to the   animal tissues. Incorporation into the lipid fraction and the low   molecular weight fraction dominated by amino acids was significantly   higher in symbioses with algae of clade A than of clade B, suggesting   that the genetically different algae in C. gigantea are not functionally   equivalent.

We   hypothesized that: (i) below-ground organisms, both herbivores (negative   effect on plants) and detritivores (positive effect on plants), will   have a profound effect on the interactions among above-ground   arthropods; (ii) floral herbivores will negatively affect other   above-ground herbivores associated with the plant; and (iii) not only   above- and below-ground herbivores, but also detritivores will affect   the production of secondary metabolites, i.e. glucosinolates, in the   plants.   2.

Our results show that not only above- and below-ground herbivores,   but also detritivores affected other herbivores and parasitoids   associated with the host plant. Most effects were not additive because   their strength changed when other organisms belonging to different   functional groups or food web compartments were present. Moreover,   below-ground herbivore and detritivore effects on above-ground fauna   were related to changes in glucosinolate concentrations and in quantity   of resources.   4.

Method: We examine the extent to which novel, gravity-based spherical   plots can produce revealing visualizations to incorporate the complexity   of such multidimensional acceleration data using a suite of different   acceleration-derived metrics with a view to highlighting patterns that   are not obvious using current approaches. The basis for the   visualisation involved three-dimensional plots of the smoothed   acceleration values, which then occupied points on the surface of a   sphere. This sphere was divided into facets and point density within   each facet expressed as a histogram. Within each facet-dependent   histogram, data were also grouped into frequency bins of any desirable   parameters, most particularly dynamic body acceleration (DBA), which   were then presented as discs on a central spine radiating from the   facet. Greater radial distances from the sphere surface indicated   greater DBA values while greater disc diameter indicated larger numbers   of data points with that particular value.   Conclusions: We indicate how this approach links behaviour and proxies   for energetics and can inform our identification and understanding of   movement-related processes, highlighting subtle differences in movement   and its associated energetics. This approach has ramifications that   should expand to areas as disparate as disease identification,   lifestyle, sports practice and wild animal ecology.

Nothing is known, however, if a similar relationship exists in other   organisms like fungi. Here, we explored the N-RS relationship across   sporocarps of 93 fungal species that varied in their guilds   (mutualistic, saprotrophic and parasitic) as well as tissue' types (caps   and stipes). We hypothesized that RS, N and protein concentrations were   higher for saprotrophic fungi than for either mutualistic or parasitic   fungi and were higher for caps than for stipes. We also hypothesized   that respiration of fungal guild could be predicted by the N   concentration. Lastly, we predicted N and RS were phylogenetically   conserved and that by subtracting metabolically inactive N in chitin, we   could improve the N-RS relationship. Sporocarp N concentration only   explained 26\% of the variation in RS across species. We found a   significant difference in the N-RS relationship among the three fungal   guilds, but no difference between the two tissue types. Saprotrophic   species had higher N concentration and respiration than mutualistic and   parasitic fungal species. Sporocarp components differed with caps   showing both higher respiration and higher N and protein concentrations   than stipes. Overall, our results show that fungal sporocarp nitrogen   concentration is phylogenetically conserved among fungal families and   may prove to be a strong predictor of fungal guild. The positive N-RS   relationships existed for all fungal species (similar to plants), within   fungal guilds (similar to plant functional groups), and fungal tissue'   types (like plants' organs). The clear linkage of fungal sporocarp   respiration to total N concentration could help improve C and N cycling   models in forest ecosystems by including estimates of fungal respiration   based on fungal N concentration.",1727,NO,RO,,,

The aim of this work   was to analyse the population structure of the rabies virus (RABV)   variants associated with vampire bats in the Americas and to study their   phylodynamic pattern within Argentina. The phylogenetic analysis based   on all available vampire bat-related N gene sequences showed both a   geographical and a temporal structure. The two largest groups of RABV   variants from Argentina were isolated from northwestern Argentina and   from the central western zone of northeastern Argentina, corresponding   to livestock areas with different climatic, topographic and   biogeographical conditions, which determined their dissemination and   evolutionary patterns. In addition, multiple introductions of the   infection into Argentina, possibly from Brazil, were detected. The   phylodynamic analysis suggests that RABV transmission dynamics is   characterized by initial epizootic waves followed by local enzootic   cycles with variable persistence.

There is considerable interest in how parasite life   cycle rates, growth, and impacts on hosts will change under altered   environmental temperatures. Likewise, transformed thermal regimes may   reduce natural resistance and barriers preventing establishment of   invasive species or alter the range and impacts of established exotic   species. The Laurentian Great Lakes are some of the most invaded   ecosystems and have been profoundly shaped by exotic species. Invasion   by the parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) contributed to major   declines in many Great Lakes fish populations. In Lake Superior,   substantial progress has been made towards controlling invasive sea   lamprey and rehabilitating native fish populations. Surface water   temperatures in Lake Superior have been increasing rapidly since 1980   presenting a new challenge for management. Here we test how thermal   changes in Lake Superior have impacted the feeding and growth of the   parasitic sea lamprey. Sea lamprey have increased in size corresponding   with longer durations of thermal habitat (i.e., longer growing seasons)   for their preferred hosts. To compare regional differences in sea   lamprey feeding and growth rates, we used a bioenergetics model with   temperature estimates from a lake-wide hydrodynamic model hindcast from   1979-2006. Spatial differences in patterns of warming across the lake   result in regionally different predictions for increases in sea lamprey   feeding rates and size. These predictions were matched by data from   adult sea lamprey spawning in streams draining into these different   thermal regions. Larger sea lampreys will be more fecund and have   increased feeding rates, thus increasing mortality among host fishes.   Resource management should consider these climate driven regional   impacts when allocating resources to sea lamprey control efforts. Under   new and evolving thermal regimes, successful management systems may need   to be restructured for changing phenology, growth, and shifts in   host-parasite systems towards greater impacts on host populations.",1729,yes,RO,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,sea lamprey weight but not abundance

We hypothesised that endophytes of grasses would retard the process of   faecal degradation since grazing animals consume primarily live plant   material and excrete a large portion of the herbage they consume as   faeces. We examined the degradation rates of faeces from sheep that had   consumed pure swards of perennial ryegrass containing a range of unique   strains (AR1, AR37, or Wild type) of the fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium   lolii, or no endophyte. Ultimately, the presence of endophytes in   perennial ryegrass resulted in slower faecal decay rates compared to the   nil endophyte treatment, although only consistently for the C   concentration decay rates that were approximately 2x to 4x slower in the   endophyte-derived faecal matter. The decay rate of dry matter content   was significantly slower (ca. 1.5x) in the novel endophyte-derived   faeces (AR1 and AR37) compared to the nil endophyte-derived faeces. The   N decay rates differed significantly only in the AR1 treatment that was   approximately 4x slower than the nil endophyte group. The reduced decay   rates are attributed to the presence of endophyte-derived alkaloids in   the faeces, and a greater proportion of more easily degraded   hemicellulose in faeces from sheep that consumed the endophyte-free   grass. There were no significant differences in the faecal carbon and   nitrogen decay rates among the three endophyte strain treatments. This   suggests that all the strain-specific alkaloids might have similar   effects, or that N. lolii has a general effect that is not   strain-specific, such as altered fibre composition, as reported here.   This is the first report of a fungal endophyte affecting the rate of   faecal degradation, and the first report of the alkaloids peramine,   lolitrem B and epoxy-janthitrems in faecal matter.

In this comparative study, we analysed the genetic structure of   two freshwater trematode species with different life histories using   cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI) sequences and examined the effect of a   unidirectional river current on their genetic diversity at 10 sites   along the river. We found moderate genetic structure consistent with an   isolation-by-distance pattern among subpopulations of Coitocaecum parvum   but not in Stegodexamene anguillae. These contrasting parasite   population structures were consistent with the relative dispersal   abilities of their most mobile hosts (i.e. their definitive hosts).   Genetic diversity decreased, as a likely consequence of unidirectional   river flow, with increasing distance upstream in C. parvum, which   utilizes a definitive host with only restricted mobility. The absence of   such a pattern in S. anguillae suggests that unidirectional river flow   affects parasite species differently depending on the dispersal   abilities of their most mobile host. In conclusion, genetic structure,   genetic diversity loss and drift are stronger in parasites whose most   mobile hosts have low dispersal abilities and small home ranges. An   additional prediction can be made for parasites under unidirectional   drift: those parasites that stay longer in their benthic intermediate   host or have more than one benthic intermediate hosts would have   relatively high local recruitment and hence increased retention of   upstream genetic diversity.",1731,NO,RO,,,

Loss of habitat is just one aspect of the   overall fragmentation process. The consequences of fragmentation depend   on how different organisms respond to the intervening matrix and how   complex interactions between species and species assemblages are   disrupted. These processes are often cryptic or difficult to observe and   remain largely unpredictable. Molecular approaches provide a powerful   tool for investigating critical processes such as species mating   behaviour or dispersal following forest fragmentation. The erosion of   genetic diversity through population isolation and restriction of gene   flow in fragmented forests can also be accurately estimated. Forest   fragmentation has been shown to have negative genetic impacts on some   plant and animal species by increasing mating between close relatives   (inbreeding), thus reducing their overall genetic diversity or   decreasing population viability. Nevertheless, some species do not seem   to be negatively affected by forest fragmentation, for example either   because they manage to disperse through a wide range of landscape   elements or because they are adapted to persist in small and isolated   habitats. It can be difficult to detect genetic consequences of   fragmentation, particularly when fragmentation has been relatively   recent and species have long generation times. In this chapter, we   review the current state of knowledge on forest fragmentation genetics   with a focus on plant and animal species, highlight the importance of   molecular approaches for informing management of forest fragments and   discuss priority areas for future research.",1737,NO,RO,,,

The presence of viable AMF propagules across the   successional vegetation gradient indicates the important role of this   interaction on plant survivorship in stressful conditions such as that   present in Sisal.

Plant defence theory provides a robust framework for understanding   interactions between plants and antagonists, and for interpreting broad   patterns in the functional-trait composition of plant communities.   However, this framework has been built almost entirely on traits   expressed by seedlings and mature plants.   2. No equivalent seed defence theory exists that recognizes the distinct   suite of natural enemies that seeds encounter, and the unique   constraints to their response. Furthermore, most attention has been paid   to insect and vertebrate seed predators active above ground, whereas   microbes in soil also have large effects on seed survival, particularly   for plants that recruit from soil seed banks.   3. We suggest that concurrent selection on seed dormancy and resistance   to microbial antagonists should result in distinct seed defence   syndromes. We predict that species with physical seed dormancy will rely   on physical defences to exclude predators and pathogens, and rapid seed   germination to escape pathogens at the emergence stage. In contrast,   species with physiological seed dormancy will deploy a continuum of   physical and chemical defences, depending on soil pathogen pressure and   duration of seed persistence. Finally, seeds of some species persist in   the soil in a non-dormant, imbibed state, and lack obvious chemical and   physical defences. These seeds may be especially dependent upon   protection from beneficial seed-inhabiting microbes.   4. Framing a general `seed defence theory' may help to account for the   distribution of seed dormancy types across ecosystems. We predict that   physiological dormancy will be favoured in dry or well-drained   environments where pathogen pressure is relatively low, germination cues   are most unpredictable, and seedling recruitment success is most   variable. In contrast, physical dormancy should be favoured in warm and   moist environments where pathogen pressure is high, and where   germination cues are a stronger predictor of recruitment success.   Persistent, non-dormant seeds are restricted to relatively aseasonal   environments where favourable conditions for recruitment can occur over   most of the year.   5. Synthesis. Integrating seed defence and dormancy traits can provide   new insights into selection on dormancy types, and will help elucidate   major trends in seed ecology and evolution. Understanding how seeds are   defended also may improve our ability to predict plant regeneration and   help develop innovative management strategies for weedy and invasive   species.",1744,NO,RO,,,

For   instance, trematode infections significantly reduce consumption by the   herbivorous gastropod Littorina littorea, in turn affecting the   composition of coastal macroalgal communities on which the snail grazes.   However, trematodes are extremely sensitive to temperature changes, in   that production and release of infective stages (cercariae) from the   snail host are strongly accelerated by increasing temperature. Hence,   trematode-infected periwinkles may increase their rates of consumption   under warmer conditions to support the additional energetic burden   exerted through elevated cercarial shedding. We therefore hypothesized   that the combined effect of higher temperatures and parasitism may   neutralize the negative impact trematodes otherwise have on periwinkle   consumption. To test this, we performed a microcosm experiment examining   the combined effect of infection and temperature on the snails'   consumption of the green macroalgae Ulva lactuca. Our results show an   overall positive effect of temperature on consumption by larger   periwinkles, but particularly so in trematode-infected specimens.   Whereas infected snails consumed less than uninfected ones at 18 degrees   C, no difference was evident at 21 degrees C. Hence, the synergy between   parasitism and a relevant temperature increase, e.g. in lieu of expected   global warming within this century (3 degrees C), may indeed counteract   the generally negative impact of trematodes on periwinkle grazing.",1745,MAYBE,RO,yes,,

Parasite virulence varies greatly. Theory predicts that this arises   from parasites optimising a trade-off between the mortality they inflict   on current hosts, and their transmission to future hosts. The effect of   the environment on this co-evolution is rarely considered.   2. Geographic mosaics are fertile systems for studying co-evolution, but   again, the diversity of outcomes is often assumed to result from   co-evolutionary dynamism, rather than being moulded by the environment.   3. Here, we quantify variation in virulence among lakes in a geographic   mosaic of co-evolution between a trematode ectoparasite (Gyrodactylus   arcuatus) and its three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)   host.   4. Virulence varies greatly in this system, and parasites are generally   locally adapted to their hosts.   5. Parasites are also locally adapted to the water in their own lake,   and virulence is strongly related to lake pH, the dominant axis of   abiotic environmental variation in this system.   6. These results suggest that the evolution of virulence can be   substantially affected by the abiotic environment, which has important   implications for understanding co-evolution. There are also implications   for the evolutionary management of disease, e.g. ectoparasites in   aquaculture, the impacts of which might be expected to reduce given   ongoing acidification of aquatic ecosystems.",1746,no,RO,,,

Intracellular   accommodation that facilitates nutrient exchange between the two   partners and protects bacteria from plant defense reactions has been a   major evolutionary step towards mutualism. Yet the forces that drove the   selection of the late event of intracellular infection during rhizobium   evolution are unknown. To address this question, we took advantage of   the previous conversion of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum   into a legume-nodulating bacterium that infected nodules only   extracellularly. We experimentally evolved this draft rhizobium into   intracellular endosymbionts using serial cycles of legume-bacterium   cocultures. The three derived lineages rapidly gained intracellular   infection capacity, revealing that the legume is a highly selective   environment for the evolution of this trait. From genome resequencing,   we identified in each lineage a mutation responsible for the   extracellular-intracellular transition. All three mutations target   virulence regulators, strongly suggesting that several   virulence-associated functions interfere with intracellular infection.   We provide evidence that the adaptive mutations were selected for their   positive effect on nodulation. Moreover, we showed that inactivation of   the type three secretion system of R. solanacearum that initially   allowed the ancestral draft rhizobium to nodulate, was also required to   permit intracellular infection, suggesting a similar checkpoint for   bacterial invasion at the early nodulation/root infection and late   nodule cell entry levels.

We established and tested biological, physical and chemical methods   of assessing the stream bed in 26 streams from seven European countries.   We analysed penetration resistance, texture, the concentrations and   ratios of C, N, S, P, Fe, Mn in fine material < 100 mu m, and redox, pH   and electric conductivity at the surface and at 5 and 10 cm into the   substratum.   3. Sites with high stream bed quality (promoting pearl mussel   populations with good juvenile recruitment) had coarser and better   sorted substrata with significantly lower quantities of fines, and a   higher Mn concentration in the fines, than poor quality sites. Redox   potential (Eh) at sites without recruitment differed markedly between   the free-flowing water at the surface and at 5 and 10 cm in the bed,   whereas no differences were detectable at good quality sites. This was   also true of electric conductivity and, to a lesser extent, pH. The   stream bed at sites lacking pearl mussel recruitment had a more variable   and higher penetration resistance, indicating clogging of the   interstitial macropore system by the deposition of mud and compaction of   the stream bed.   4. Our results show that habitat quality for pearl mussels depends   strongly on the exchange between the surface and the interstices, which   is governed by physicochemical characteristics of the stream substratum.   Combined measurements of penetration resistance, depth gradients of Eh   and texture were most suitable for assessing stream bed quality, while   water chemistry was insufficient because of the decoupling of   interstitial and free-flowing water at poor quality sites.",1748,NO,RO,,,

CO2 concentration has risen from the industrial   revolution to the current time, and is expected to continue to rise.   Climatic changes alter physiological processes, growth, and development   in numerous plant species, potentially changing concentrations of plant   secondary compounds. These physiological changes may influence plant   population density, growth, fitness, and toxin concentrations and thus   influence the risk of toxic plants to grazing livestock. Locoweeds,   swainsonine-containing Astragalus species, are one group of plants that   may be influenced by climate change. We evaluated how two different   swainsonine-containing Astragalus species responded to elevated CO2   concentrations. Measurements of biomass, crude protein, water soluble   carbohydrates and swainsonine concentrations were measured in two   chemotypes (positive and negative for swainsonine) of each species after   growth at CO2 levels near present day and at projected future   concentrations. Biomass and water soluble carbohydrate concentrations   responded positively while crude protein concentrations responded   negatively to elevated CO2 in the two species. Swainsonine   concentrations were not strongly affected by elevated CO2 in the two   species. In the different chemotypes, biomass responded negatively and   crude protein concentrations responded positively in the   swainsonine-positive plants compared to the swainsonine-negative plants.

PSF is a good example of bidirectional interactions between biomes and   the non-living environments, acting as a major driving force of   community structure and ecosystem function. Among the major types of PSF   mediated by various soil components, there are many holes in our   knowledge of the interactions between PSF mediated by plant   species-specific litter and PSF mediated by soil microbes. Here I   discuss the role of the functional diversity of microbial decomposers in   litter-mediated PSF and also propose new hypotheses on the role of   microbial diversity in PSF mediated by pathogenic and mutualistic soil   microbes. I also review how PSF interacts with human-induced   environmental change, i.e., direct drivers of change in the ecosystem   (e.g. climate change and the invasion of alien species). Many authors   have suggested that the impact of alien plant species on ecosystems is   mediated by PSF, which also interacts with other direct drivers, such as   climate change. Using a simple model of litter-mediated PSF with   microbial decomposers, I confirm that the interactions between PSF and   other direct drivers affect the invasion process of alien species. The   model also demonstrates that the functional diversity of microbial   decomposers accelerates or decelerates the speed of the invasion   depending on the environmental change scenarios.

Theory suggests that the   relative timing of pest and natural enemy arrival in crops may influence   pest suppression. However, there is a lack of data to substantiate this   claim. We investigate the movement patterns of insects from native   vegetation (NV) and discuss the implications of these patterns for pest   control services. Using bi-directional interception traps we quantified   the number of insects crossing an NV/crop ecotone relative to a control   crop/crop interface in two agricultural regions early in the growing   season. We used these data to infer patterns of movement and net flux.   At the community-level, insect movement patterns were influenced by   ecotone in two out of three years by region combinations. At the   functional-group level, pests and parasitoids showed similar movement   patterns from NV very soon after crop emergence. However, movement   across the control interface increased towards the end of the   earlyseason sampling period. Predators consistently moved more often   from NV into crops than vice versa, even after crop emergence. Not all   species showed a significant response to ecotone, however when a   response was detected, these species showed similar patterns between the   two regions. Our results highlight the importance of NV for the   recruitment of natural enemies for early season crop immigration that   may be potentially important for pest suppression. However, NV was also   associated with crop immigration by some pest species. Hence, NV offers   both opportunities and risks for pest management. The development of   targeted NV management may reduce the risk of crop immigration by pests,   but not of natural enemies. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by   Elsevier B.V.

In plant invasion ecology, viruses and other pathogens are often   considered in terms of the enemy release hypothesis, which predicts that   plants become invasive in new ranges if they escape pathogens from their   home range. However, pathogens may sometimes facilitate host spread   rather than hinder it.   2. Previously, we hypothesized that apparent competition mediated by   barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (Luteoviridae: BYDVs, CYDVs) may   have facilitated historical grassland invasion in California, USA, where   Eurasian grasses displaced native grasses in the 18th and 19th centuries   (the disease facilitation hypotheses). However, this could have happened   only if the viruses were present during the invasion, which is unknown.   3. To investigate the historical ecology of BYDVs in California grasses,   we analysed preserved virus infections in herbarium specimens and used   the historical virus sequences to determine rough time estimates of   relevant phylogenetic events.   4. The historical viral RNA sequences we identified in invasive and   native grasses date from 1917 and are among the oldest recovered from   plants thus far and the oldest from North America.   5. Herbarium evidence and phylogenetic analysis suggest that BYDVs were   likely to have been present in wild grasses during the California   grassland invasion and to have shared some functional characteristics   with present-day isolates, supporting the disease facilitation   hypothesis.   6. We found evidence of virus spread from California to Australia (or,   less likely, from Australia to California) in the late 19th century,   when much horticultural exchange occurred, as well as potential   correspondence in the timing of virus diversification events and the   beginning of extensive human exchange between the Old and New Worlds.   7.

The Australian brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula)   introduction to New Zealand has exacted a heavy toll on native   biodiversity and presented the country with its greatest wildlife   reservoir host for bovine tuberculosis (TB). Management efforts to   control both possums and TB have been ongoing for decades, and the   biology of possums has been studied extensively in Australia and New   Zealand over the past 50 years; however, we still do not have a clear   understanding of its home-range dynamics.   Aims. To investigate determinants of home range size by using a uniquely   large dataset in the Orongorongo Valley, a highly monitored research   area in New Zealand and compare our findings with those of other   studies.   Methods. Possum density was estimated, for subpopulations on four 13-ha   cage-trap grids, by the spatially explicit capture-mark-recapture   analysis of trapping data from 10 consecutive months. Home ranges were   estimated from trap locations using a 100\% minimum convex polygon (MCP)   method for 348 individuals and analysed with respect to grid, age and   sex.   Key results. Mean (standard error) possum density, estimated as 4.87   (0.19), 6.92 (0.29), 4.08 (0.21) and 4.20 (0.19) ha(-1) for the four   grids, was significantly negatively correlated with mean MCP home-range   size. Grid, age, and the interaction of age and sex were significantly   related to home-range size. Older possums had larger home ranges than   did younger possums. When `juvenile cohort' and `adult cohort' data were   analysed separately, to investigate the significant interaction, males   in the `adult cohort' had significantly larger home ranges than did   females, with the grid effect still being apparent, whereas neither sex   nor grid effects were significant for the `juvenile cohort'.   Conclusions. Our findings indicate that, in addition to density, age and   sex are likely to be consistent determinants of possum home-range size,   but their influences may be masked in some studies by the complexity of   wild-population dynamics.   Implications. Our findings have strong implications regarding both   disease transmission among possums and possum management. The fact that   adult males occupy larger home ranges and the understanding that possum   home range increases as population density decreases are an indication   that males may be the primary drivers of disease transmission in possum   populations. The understanding that possum home range increases as   population density decreases could be a direct reflection of the ability   of TB to persist in the wild that counteracts current management   procedures. If individuals, and particularly males, infected with TB can   withstand control measures, their ensuing home-range expansion will   result in possible bacteria spread in both the expanded area of   habitation and new individuals becoming subjected to infection (both   immigrant possums and other control survivors). Therefore, managers   should consider potential approaches for luring possum males in control   operations.",1755,NO,RO,,,

However, while   functionally distinct belowground microorganisms commonly co-occur in   the rhizosphere, their combined effects, and relative contributions,   respectively, on performance of aboveground plant-associated organisms   are virtually unexplored.

DB,   which also act as AMF helper bacteria, enhanced root colonization by   AMF, whereas AMF did not affect DB abundance.

The resulting patterns greatly affect   biomagnificiation and bioaccumulation. The complexity of food webs can   be expressed by connectance C (ratio of observed number of links vs.   total number of theoretically possible links) and the interactive   strength. Lower values of interactive strength tend to stabilize food   webs.   The ultimate source of the vast majority of energy-sustaining food webs   is the sun. Marine and terrestrial contributions to total primary   production are fairly evenly balanced. When primary producers (plants,   algae) are eaten while alive, they are said to enter the grazing food   chain. Most primary producers die before being consumed and thereby fuel   the detritus food chain, which is strongly influenced by microorganisms.   Parasites have an essential though often underappreciated impact on food   chains.   Recent approaches to food webs combine metabolic theory with ecological   stoichiometry - metabolic rates of various organisms are assumed to be   constrained by size, temperature, and stoichiometry. The ratio of C:N:P   (Redfield ratio) in phytoplankton is remarkably stable. Energy and   matter are tightly linked by chemistry and metabolic energetics. Food   chains and webs result in nutrient cycles that can be examined at   various scales, ranging from individuals to the entire planet. Depending   on the scale, nutrient cycles are open or closed. The basic concepts of   food webs and nutrient cycles can be applied regardless of habitat, but   terrestrial and aquatic species experience very different environments,   which has affected the evolution and dominance of species and resulted   in considerable differences in nutrient cycles.",1759,NO,RO,,,

Despite little variation   in the richness of each trophic group, we found considerable changes in   trophic link properties across the landscape complexity gradient.   Unexpectedly, aphid-parasitoid food webs exhibited a lower complexity   (lower linkage density, interaction diversity and generality) in   structurally complex landscapes, which was related to the dominance of   one aphid species in complex landscapes. Nevertheless, primary   parasitism, as well as hyperparasitism, was higher in complex   landscapes, with primary parasitism reaching levels for potentially   successful biological control. In conclusion, landscape complexity   appeared to foster higher parasitism rates, but simpler food webs,   thereby casting doubt on the general importance of food web complexity   for ecosystem functioning.",1760,NO,RO,,,

The omnivorous nature of slugs   makes them potential disrupters of predator-prey relationships, as a   direct threat to small insects and through indirect, plant-mediated   effects. Here, we examined the effects of the presence of two species of   slugs, Arion rufus (native) and A. vulgaris (invasive) on the   survivorship of young Pieris brassicae caterpillars when feeding on   Brassica rapa plants, and on plant attractiveness to the main natural   enemy of P. brassicae, the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. In two separate   predation experiments, caterpillar mortality was significantly higher on   plants co-infested with A. rufus or A. vulgaris. Moreover, caterpillar   mortality correlated positively with slug mass and leaf consumption by   A. vulgaris. At the third trophic level, plants infested with slugs and   plants co-infested with slugs and caterpillars were far less attractive   to parasitoids than plants damaged by caterpillars only, independently   of slug species. Chemical analyses confirmed that volatile emissions,   which provide foraging cues for parasitoids, were strongly reduced in   co-infested plants. Our study shows that the presence of slugs has the   potential to affect insect populations, directly via consumptive   effects, and indirectly via changes in plant volatiles that result in a   reduced attraction of natural enemies. The fitness cost for P. brassicae   imposed by increased mortality in presence of slugs may be   counterbalanced by the benefit of escaping its parasitoids.",1761,NO,RO,,,

Currently, predictions on the vulnerability of ecological   communities to extinction cascades are based on models that focus on   bottom-up effects, which cannot capture the effects of extinctions at   higher trophic levels. We show, in experimental insect communities, that   harvesting of single carnivorous parasitoid species led to a significant   increase in extinction rate of other parasitoid species, separated by   four trophic links. Harvesting resulted in the release of prey from   top-down control, leading to increased interspecific competition at the   herbivore trophic level. This resulted in increased extinction rates of   non-harvested parasitoid species when their host had become rare   relative to other herbivores. The results demonstrate a mechanism for   horizontal extinction cascades, and illustrate that altering the   relationship between a predator and its prey can cause wide-ranging   ripple effects through ecosystems, including unexpected extinctions.",1762,NO,RO,,,

Viruses have been shown to decrease photochemical   efficiency (F-v/F-m) of Emiliania huxleyi late in infection, although   the precise timing and mechanism of this reduction remain largely   unexplored. We coupled high-resolution temporal measurements of   photosystem II (PSII) efficiency during coccolithovirus EhV-86 infection   with expression of host psbA (D1), PSII assembly and repair genes (ctpA,   ftsH, and HCF136), and antioxidant genes (ascorbate peroxidase [apx]   and superoxide dismutase [sod2]) using digital PCR. F-v/F-m declined   significantly in infected cultures from 1.25 h post-inoculation (p.i.),   while non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), measured as the normalized   Stern-Volmer parameter, significantly increased from 4.0 h p.i.

Significant down-regulation   of sod2 homologs and apx was observed later, starting at 1 to 3 h p.i.   Our data suggest that virus-induced photophysiological changes may begin   with a reduction in PSII repair and assembly, followed by a reduction in   antioxidants that may result in an accumulation of damaged PSII   complexes. Elevated NPQ during infection may help dissipate excess   energy resulting from damage to PSII.

Thus, on-site   treatment is the preferred option to treat the slaughterhouse effluents   for water reuse and potential energy recovery due to the conversion of   organics into biogas. The treatment of an actual SWW is studied in a   combined biological system, including aerobic and anaerobic processes.   An anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) followed by an aerobic activated   sludge (AS) reactor are used in continuous mode at laboratory scale.   Response surface methodology (RSM) is used for the process optimization   to maximize biogas yield and to remove the total organic carbon (TOC)   and total nitrogen (TN) while minimizing the total suspended solids   (TSS) residuals. The effects of the flow rate, the pH, the influent TOC   concentration, and their interactions on the overall treatment   efficiency as well as the biogas yield are studied. Maximum TOC and TN   removals of 85.03 and 72.10\%, minimum TSS residual of 19.54 mg/L, and   maximum biogas yield of 116.56 mL/min are found at the optimum operating   conditions of the influent TOC concentration of 343 mg/L, the feed flow   rate of 63 mL/min, and the pH of 6.84. The agreement between model   predictions and experimental values indicates that the proposed model   could describe the performance of combined anaerobic aerobic systems for   SWW treatment and the reduction of operating costs via biogas production   while providing high-quality treated effluent for water reuse.

Theoretical ecology and empirical data support the potential of   introduced mammals to drive native species to extinction, indeed the   majority of practical evidence comes from insular environments, where   conditions may differ from the mainland. We analyzed the effects of an   introduced lagomorph, the eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus on   two native mammals, the European hare Lepus europaeus and the red fox   Vulpes vulpes. We used relative abundances collected over 8 years at 30   protected areas in Italy. A generalized linear mixed model was fit to   test various hypotheses about the relationships between cottontails,   foxes and climatic conditions over the abundance of native hares. In our   model, hare and cottontail abundances did not show a negative   relationship and we believe that no direct competition occurs between   the two species. However, the relationship between fox and hare   abundances, positive when cottontails were scarce, became more and more   negative as cottontails increased: this supports the hypothesis that   indirect dynamics like apparent competition exists between the two   lagomorphs. Climatic conditions, expressed through the North Atlantic   Oscillation, did not affect the relationship between cottontail and hare   abundances. As the impact of parasites on mammal populations is   generally climate dependent, we believe that cottontails do not play a   direct role in the cycle of parasites affecting hares. Our results   provide a clue that an invasive mammal, the eastern cottontail, is   modifying the predator-prey relationship between two native species in a   non-insular environment. The existence of such dynamics should lead   wildlife managers to account for the effect of introduced species in   their decision making, directing control activities on cottontails and   not on native foxes.",1765,NO,RO,,,

Air temperature is commonly obtained from   synoptic measurements in weather stations. In Africa, the spatial   distribution of weather stations is often limited and the dissemination   of temperature data is variable, therefore limiting their use for   real-time applications. Compensation for this paucity of information may   be obtained by using satellite-based methods. However, the derivation of   near surface air temperature (Ta), from the land surface temperature   (Ts) derived from satellite is far from straight forward. Some studies   have tried to derive maximum Ta from satellites through regression   analysis but the accuracy obtained is quite variable according to the   study. The main objective of this study was to explore the possibility   of retrieving high-resolution Ta data from the Moderate Resolution   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Ts products over different ecosystems   in Africa. First, comparisons between night MODIS Ts data with minimum   Ta showed that MODIS nighttime products provide a good estimation of   minimum Ta over different ecosystems (with (Delta Ts - Ta) centered at 0   degrees C, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.73 degrees C and a standard   deviation = 2.4 degrees C). Secondly, comparisons between day MODIS Ts   data with maximum Ta showed that (Delta Ts - Ta) strongly varies   according to the seasonality, the ecosystems, the solar radiation, and   cloud-cover. Two factors proposed in the literature to retrieve maximum   Ta from Ts, i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and   the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA), were analyzed.

For example, they have   confirmed the long-hypothesized role of generalist predators in   retarding early-season build-up of pest populations prior to the arrival   of more specialized predators and parasitoids and documented the   ubiquity of secondary and intraguild predation. However, raw qualitative   gut-content data cannot be used to assess the relative impact of   different predator taxa on prey population dynamics: they must first be   weighted by the relative detectability periods for molecular prey   remains for each predator-prey combination.

This study applied a combination of   laboratory experiments and field observations to investigate the effects   of reduced freshwater input on Apalachicola oysters. Oysters suffered   significant disease-related mortality under high-salinity, drought   conditions, particularly during the warm summer months. Mortality was   size-specific, with large oysters of commercially harvestable size being   more susceptible than small oysters. A potential salinity threshold was   revealed between 17 and 25 ppt, where small oysters began to suffer   mortality, and large oysters exhibited an increase in mortality. These   findings have important implications for watershed management, because   upstream freshwater releases could be carefully timed and allocated   during stressful periods of the summer to reduce disease-related oyster   mortality.

Thus, very different mechanisms could produce similar patterns.   2. Using replicated common gardens located along an elevation and   distance gradient, observational studies in the wild, and a greenhouse   inoculation experiment, we examined these two non-mutually exclusive   hypotheses for Populus angustifolia and its fungal leaf pathogen   community.   3. Supporting the environmental heterogeneity hypothesis, plant   genotypic effects on fungal leaf pathogen communities were two to three   times stronger within than among gardens. Consistent with the local   adaptation hypothesis, plant genotypic effects on pathogens also varied   significantly among gardens (i.e. G x E interaction effect).   Observational data from the wild and our greenhouse inoculation   experiment unveiled clinal adaptation in plant genetic resistance that   is correlated with disease risk along the elevation gradient, but did   not support local pathogen adaptation to plants or vice versa.   4. Synthesis. While our study found that plant genotype plays a   significant role in shaping associated pathogen communities at local and   geographic scales, the environment most strongly influenced P.   angustifolia leaf pathogens at the geographic scale. Plant genetic   effects on pathogens were also influenced by the environment,   highlighting the potential for environmental (e.g. climate) change to   trigger local evolutionary responses in plant-pathogen community   interactions.",1776,NO,RO,,,

We hypothesize that ice formation   promotes attachment of these non-motile phytoplankton to overlying ice,   thereby maintaining a favorable position for the diatoms in the photic   zone. However, it is unclear whether the diatoms themselves are   responsible for ice nucleation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed   associations of bacterial epiphytes with the dominant diatoms of the   phytoplankton assemblage, and bacteria isolated from the phytoplankton   showed elevated temperatures of crystallization (T-c) as high as -3   degrees C. Ice nucleation-active bacteria were identified as belonging   to the genus Pseudomonas, but we could not demonstrate that they were   sufficiently abundant to incite the observed freezing. Regardless of the   source of ice nucleation activity, the resulting production of frazil   ice may provide a means for the diatoms to be recruited to the overlying   lake ice, thereby increasing their fitness. Bacterial epiphytes are   likewise expected to benefit from their association with the diatoms as   recipients of organic carbon excreted by their hosts.

Heinz Rennenberg,2015,Communities and Ecosystem Functioning,NA,77-91,77-91,NA,"Ecosystem and community functioning is highly dependent on the interplay   of its different biota in acquisition and distribution of resources   required for maintenance, growth and development, defense against   abiotic and biotic stresses in the environment, and competitive and   symbiotic interactions. These processes constitute the predominant   ``sinks'' of resources in all biota, but even mutualistic coexistence   may require the investment of additional resources, for example, in   order to prevent a switch from coexistence to parasitism. The interplay   of different biota in resource acquisition and distribution is of   particular significance when availability of resources is limited. Under   these conditions, different biota will compete for a limited resource,   but may also avoid competition by different resource acquisition   strategies in space (e.g., exploitation of different soil horizons)   or/and time (e.g., preferential acquisition at different seasons). In   this context, plants as primary producers play a decisive role and often   control resource acquisition by other biota, in particular, by soil   microbial communities.   It has been generally assumed that at a given net primary productivity   (NPP), plants in their specific environment allocate different fractions   of their NPP to their internal sinks and that this allocation is   characterized by trade-off mechanisms. This indicates, for example, that   an enhanced requirement of resources for defense or competitive   interactions may result in reduced resource availability for growth and   development. However, recent studies indicate that such trade-off   mechanisms are not generally observed and facilitation mechanisms can be   found instead, because the expansion of an existing or the generation of   a new sink of resources can enhance NPP. As a consequence, the use of   resources for defense and competitive interactions will, for example,   not necessarily reduce resource availability for growth and development.   Therefore, the investment of part of the NPP in competitive and   symbiotic interactions usually will not weaken short-term plant   performance and will even improve it in the long run.   Because of the immobile lifestyle of plants, successful resource   acquisition requires space occupation by growth either by the plant   itself or by its symbiont(s). Aboveground space occupation is needed to   acquire light and CO2, belowground space occupation to acquire nutrients   and water. Occupying space and acquiring resources can be achieved by   different strategies, that is, competition, symbiotic interactions,   avoidance of competition, and facilitation, all of which imply the   development of specific structural and physiological features. These   strategies rely largely on signaling between biota often by volatile   metabolites and result either in more efficient resource acquisition for   a given plant species (e.g., water and nutrient acquisition   bymycorrhizal roots), sharing the same resource between plant species by   differential use (e.g., preferential N uptake at different seasons), or   the exploitation of existing resources that are not generally available   (e.g., fixation of atmospheric N-2 as N source). The latter may be   defined as developing a physiological niche.",1779,NO,RO,,,

We used cavity nesting Hymenoptera and their parasitoids   collected in a subtropical forest as a model system to test whether   hosts, parasitoids, and their interactions are influenced by tree PD and   a comprehensive set of environmental variables, including tree species   richness. Parasitism rate and parasitoid abundance were positively   correlated with tree PD. All variables describing parasitoids decreased   with elevation, and were, except parasitism rate, dependent on host   abundance. Quantitative descriptors of host parasitoid networks were   independent of the environment. Our study indicates that host parasitoid   interactions in species-rich forests are related to the PD of the tree   community, which influences parasitism rates through parasitoid   abundance. We show that effects of tree community PD are much stronger   than effects of tree species richness, can cascade to high trophic   levels, and promote trophic interactions.

In this paper,   the case of the invasive North American tree Prunus serotina in Flanders   (Belgium) is presented. Our main objectives were to determine the   susceptibility of forest stands to invasion by P. serotina and the   subsequent effects of invasion on the understorey community. We used the   large database of the first Flemish Forest Inventory. Multiple logistic   regressions indicated that P. serotina occurred more frequently in   privately owned, younger forest on coarse-textured, dry soils (podzols),   and the combination of these factors allowed us to correctly predict   presence/absence of P. serotina in 70\% of the validation plots.   However, locational variables proved to be important as well, indicating   that the invasion process is still ongoing. Prediction of P. serotina   densities by means of multiple linear regressions was less successful.   Effects on the understorey richness were analysed by comparing the   number of species and the mean Ellenberg values between pairs of plots,   only differing by the presence of P. serotina in the shrub layer. A   reduction of the understorey richness following invasion was only   pronounced on the more moist soils, while compositional changes mainly   occurred on drier soils. It is concluded that priority for control   should be given to landscapes with a low fraction of invaded stands and   to forest stands located on more moist soils. However, using its   potential to threaten native biodiversity as an argument for control   should be done with care as further research is needed whether the   observed negative effects are due to a species (i.e. native vs.   non-native) or a density effect (high vs. low).",1782,NO,RO,,,

Grazing   on bacteria by protists was evaluated using the FLB disappearance   method. Lysis of bacteria due to viral infections was measured using the   virus reduction approach. Losses of bacterial production caused by   protists (PMMBP) dominated losses caused by viruses (VMMBP) throughout   the study. Lysogenic viral production was detected in 7 out of 21   measurements and constituted from 33.9 to 100.0\% of the total viral   production. Significantly higher PMMBP and lower VMMBP were detected in   waters affected by ice melting compared with unaffected waters.   Consequently, significantly more bacterial carbon was channelled to the   higher trophic levels in affected waters (13.05 +/- A 5.98 mu gC l(-1)   day(-1)) than in unaffected waters (8.91 +/- A 8.33 mu gC l(-1)   day(-1)).

Such food   web modules entailing predation and competition have been the focus of   much theory, whereas modules involving mutualism have received far less   attention. We examined an empirically common food web module involving   mutualistic (N (2)) and parasitic (N (3)) consumers exploiting a   resource of a basal mutualist (N (1)), as illustrated by plants,   pollinators, and nectar robbers. This mutualism-parasitism food web   module is structurally similar to exploitative competition, suggesting   that the module of two consumers exploiting a resource is unstable.   Rather than parasitic consumers destabilizing the module through (-,-)   indirect interactions, two mechanisms associated with the mutualism can   actually enhance the persistence of the module. First, the positive   feedback of mutualism favors coexistence in stable limit cycles, whereby   (+,-) indirect interactions emerge in which increases in N (2) have   positive effects on N (3) and increases in N (3) have negative effects   on N (2). This (+,-) indirect interaction arising from the saturating   positive feedback of mutualism has broad feasibility across many types   of food web modules entailing mutualism. Second, optimization of   resource exploitation by the mutualistic consumer can lead to   persistence of the food web module in a stable equilibrium.

To determine how current   trends and variation in climate change affect seedling establishment, we   analyzed demographic responses to spatiotemporal variation to   temperature and soil moisture in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We   monitored seedling establishment for 10 years in five plots located   along an elevational gradient of five dominant tree species: Acer   rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron tulip fera, Nyssa sylvatica, and   Quercus rubra. A hierarchical Bayes model allowed us to incorporate   different sources of information, observation errors, and the inherent   variability of the establishment process. From our analysis, spring   temperatures and heterogeneity in soil moisture emerge as key drivers,   and they act through nonlinear population demographic processes. We   found that all species benefited from warmer springs, in particular the   species found on dry slopes, N.sylvatica, and those dominant at higher   elevations, Betula spp. and Q. rubra. This last species also benefited   from dry environments. Conversely, L. tulipifera, which is abundant on   mesic sites, experienced highest establishment rates at high moisture.   The mechanisms behind these results may differ among species. Higher   temperatures are apparently more important for some, while dry   conditions and reduced pathogenic attacks on their seeds and new   seedlings have a large impact for others. Our results suggest that only   communities found at higher elevations are in danger of regional   extinction when their habitats disappear given the current climatic   trends.

EhV infection is accompanied by induction of hallmarks   of programmed cell death and production of reactive oxygen species   (ROS). Here we characterized alterations in ROS metabolism and explored   its role during infection. Transcriptomic analysis of ROS-related genes   predicted an increase in glutathione (GSH) and H2O2 production during   infection. In accordance, using biochemical assays and specific   fluorescent probes we demonstrated the overproduction of GSH during   lytic infection. We also showed that H2O2 production, rather than   superoxide, is the predominant ROS during the onset of the lytic phase   of infection. Using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and   multispectral imaging flow cytometry, we showed that the profound   co-production of H2O2 and GSH occurred in the same subpopulation of   cells but at different subcellular localization.

In silico tests showed   that holothurinoside A and DCA (3,4-dichloroaniline) had highest and   lowest docking scores for cyanobacterial photosystem II, respectively.   Although the most successful biocide was commercial biocide, zinc pyrion   in the antifouling tests, the semi-purified triterpene glycosides based   plates showed excellent antifouling properties. The control plates were   heavily fouled by sea worms whereas the plates including semi-purified   triterpene glycosides and zinc-pyrion prevented macro fouling   settlement.

Such   intensification strategies, that require both material and investment   increases, may impose economic as well as environmental risks, given the   fragile island ecosystems. In order to assess the environmental   performance of banana production in Guadeloupe. emergy synthesis methods   were applied to six different types of banana cropping systems   previously identified in the island. Additionally, aiming at improving   managerial capacity and investment decision making, environmental   performance results were contrasted with economic analysis for the six   cropping systems. As a general outcome, these analyses showed that the   better the environmental performance of the cropping system, the worse   its economic performance. This result was corroborated by an increased   contrast among cropping systems as related to their dependence on   purchased inputs, although all cropping systems followed the same   intensive and arguably wasteful agricultural model. Therefore, the   analyses point out that sustainable banana production in Guadeloupe   depends on a shift from the high fossil input model to a natural   resources intensive one. In this sense, emergy flow analysis shows that   innovation towards environmentally sound practices that would enhance   nutrient cycling: integrate weeds, pests and diseases control; and   improve the banana packing process might result in most positive impacts   on overall sustainability. Economic analysis showed that the high labour   costs contribute largely to the dependency of banana production on   agricultural subsidies. However, reorienting the current European   agricultural income policy to an environmental performance-based   subvention might be a policy opportunity to achieve the present social   goals while promoting sustainability in banana production. Furthermore,   the EC regulation on quality standards for commercial bananas. by   imposing strict aesthetic benchmarks, has a negative effect on the   sustainability of banana production because substantial non-renewable   and purchased emergy inflows into banana production systems aim to   improve aesthetic standards over sound ecological management.

We start by providing a not exhaustive list of five   different types of uncertainties end-users of nutrigenomics have to cope   with without being able to perceive them as risks and to subject them to   risk-analysis. First, genes connected with the human body or nutrients   can have different functions in interaction with their environment (for   instance, one nutrient can be healthy for the heart, but can also be a   high risk in relation to cancer). Secondly, uncertainties are formed by   risk analyses. Will it be possible to calculate a certain risk of   getting a certain condition with a certain lifestyle? Will it be   difficult to separate the genetic component and the lifestyle component?   How high will these risks be? How will these risks be handled by the   actors? In the case of personal genotyping, it is unclear how frequent   an adverse polymorphism will occur. Will every individual have a certain   vulnerability to a certain disease or will it only be applicable to a   small group of the population or particular populations? Thirdly,   dietary advices are subject to uncertainties and still to be developed   professional standards: some will have adverse outcomes, some will not   delay the disease, and some will assume uncertain associations between   nutrients, lifestyle, and genetic vulnerabilities. Fourth, with regard   to the usefulness of tests it is uncertain to what extent risks   indications about obesity and diabetes and other vulnerabilities really   influence people to live healthier and therefore will help to prevent   these conditions. Fifth, it is uncertain how and what nutrigenomics   products will be developed and used. Will it be possible to develop more   effectively health improving products? Or is this too difficult and will   nutrigenomics continue to be used in not always justified health claims   as a commercial and marketing tool? Present-day ethics and theories of   responsibilities presuppose that uncertainties will disappear and   concentrate on what seems to be fixed and stable in science. We develop   provisional thoughts that assume that the dynamic of science to produce   uncertainties and dilemmas is endemic, and we stress the need for   consumers to institutionalize value searching, exploring, and   deliberating devices in the health and food sector to find out the most   important uncertainties and correspondingly socially desirable research   priorities.",1789,NO,RO,,,

Historically, mutualisms have been considered to be less important   than antagonisms in affecting the composition of ecological communities.   In plant communities, beneficial microbes may feature as keystone   mutualists in structuring community composition. Understanding the   direction and magnitude of mutualist effects at the community scale may   be critical for making accurate predictions on plant responses to   climate change, particularly for mutualists that ameliorate   climate-induced stressors. Such mitigation could shift outcomes between   mutualist-enhanced species diversity and mutualist-reduced diversity,   depending on whether a mutualist accelerates habitat modification or   competitive exclusion by its partner species.   2. Here, we tested the relative importance and interactive effects of   altered precipitation and symbiosis between an epichloid fungal   endophyte and a dominant grass species for dune plant communities along   the Great Lakes, USA. In 2010, we imposed field manipulations of   endophyte presence in the foundation dune grass Ammophila breviligulata   in combination with rainout shelters and rainfall additions. We   monitored natural rates of colonization by new plant individuals over 3   years.   3. Under the current precipitation regime, endophyte symbiosis in A.   breviligulata reduced colonizing plant diversity, species richness and   evenness. This effect depended on the amount of precipitation, with the   symbiosis having weaker effects on plant diversity under both augmented   and reduced rainfall treatments.   4. Despite the overall negative effect of endophyte symbiosis on plant   diversity, plant responses to the endophyte were species specific. A   federally threatened forb, Cirsium pitcheri, increased in abundance when   the symbiosis was present, regardless of precipitation regime. Endophyte   symbiosis in A. breviligulata caused minor reductions in the abundance   of other grass species; however, augmented precipitation benefited other   grasses.   5. Synthesis. We show that microbial mutualisms can have strong effects   on community structure in a native ecosystem and that the amount of   precipitation has the potential to alter how these keystone species   interactions affect community composition. Predictions on future plant   community structure, for both restored and native dunes, can be improved   by accounting for the presence of fungal symbionts in the foundation   plant species.",1790,NO,RO,,,

Organic farming also resulted   in improved soil structure with higher organic matter concentrations and   higher soil aggregation, a profound reduction in groundwater nitrate   concentrations, and fewer plant-parasitic nematodes. Temporal stability   between the three farming systems was similar, but when excluding years   of Phytophthora outbreaks in potato, temporal stability was higher in   the organic farming system. There are two non-mutually exclusive   mechanistic explanations for these results. First, the enhanced spatial   stability in the organic farming system could result from changes in   resource-based (i.e. bottom-up) processes, which coincides with the   observed higher nutrient provisioning throughout the season in soils   with more organic matter. Second, enhanced resource inputs may also   affect stability via increased predator-based (i.e. top-down) control.   According to this explanation, predators stabilize population dynamics   of soil organisms, which is supported by the observed higher soil food   web biomass in the organic farming system.We conclude that closure of   the yield gap between organic and conventional farming can be a matter   of time and that organic farming may result in greater spatial stability   of soil biotic and abiotic properties and soil processes. This is likely   due to the time required to fundamentally alter soil properties.",1791,NO,RO,,,

The effects of mulches of dairy manure solids (DMS) and composted dairy   manure solids (CDMS) on soil N and P dynamics, nematode community   structure, and root growth were studied over three years in a new field   of raspberry planted in northwestern Washington. Five fertilizer/mulch   treatments were applied to 16-m-long row plots: (1) 34kg N ha(-1)   applied as granular fertilizer in April; (2) 34kg N ha(-1) applied in   May; (3) split application of 34kg N ha(-1) April + 34kg N ha(-1) May;   (4) 34kg N ha(-1) fertilizer + DMS; and (5) 34kg N ha(-1) fertilizer +   CDMS. Cumulative applications of DMS and CDMS were 28 and 49 Mg dry   material ha(-1) concentrated on the raspberry row, respectively.   Adsorption of NO3-N and P onto anion-exchange resins, and October soil   NO3-N concentrations, were lower in mulched soil than in non-mulched   soil, but leaf N concentrations were greater in mulch treatments. Fine   root biomass and the abundances of bacterivorous, fungivorous, and   omnivorous-predacious nematodes, and the nematode Structure Index were   greater in mulched soil than in non-mulched soil. Mulches had no effect   on root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans) infecting roots. Our   results suggest that mulches of composted or non-composted DMS can   enhance root growth, overall soil biological activity, and nutrient   acquisition while also reducing soil mineral N pools and the risk of   nitrate leaching. There were no substantial differences between   composted and non-composted DMS.",1792,NO,RO,,,

Results of this multi-tiered approach provide   strong evidence of the causal linkage between infection and   malformations while offering additional insights about the influence of   experimental venue on effect size. Among years and across 18 wetlands in   northern California, Ribeiroia infection was a strong predictor of   malformation frequency, which ranged from 0 to 77\% at all sites (n =   6,511). Correspondingly, the addition of >500 Ribeiroia infected snails   to an experimentally divided wetland using a three-year Before After   Control Impact (BACI) design caused sharp increases in Ribeiroia   infection and severe malformations in P. regilla during the manipulation   year (but not pre- or post-manipulation). These results were   complemented by the findings from a replicated (n = 16)   enclosure/exclosure study conducted on both sides of the divided wetland   (Hog Lake), which showed increased infection and malformations only   among larvae within cages that allowed parasite entry and only on the   manipulated side. No differences in mortality were observed among   animals as a function of cage type. A comparison of the slope between   observed infection and malformations as a function of venue (previous   laboratory work and the two spatial scales of this study (cages and   whole-pond)) indicated that small-scale experiments exhibit stronger   effects relative to results from larger spatial extents. Multi-year   sampling also indicated that malformed frogs were unlikely to return as   breeding adults, highlighting the potential for population-level impacts   associated with high Ribeiroia infections. Taken together, these results   provide support for the causal relationship between Ribeiroia infection   and amphibian malformations under realistic conditions while   simultaneously emphasizing the influence of study venue on the strength   of this relationship.",1793,NO,RO,,,

Some food chain models reproduce cascade   effects seen in nature, but to what extent is this dependent on their   formulation? We show that inclusion of processes represented   mathematically as density-dependent regulation of either consumer uptake   or mortality rates is necessary for the generation of realistic   top-down' cascades in simple food chain models. Realistically modelled   bottom-up' cascades, caused by changing nutrient input, are also   dependent on the inclusion of density dependence, but especially on   mortality regulation as a caricature of, e.g. disease and parasite   dynamics or intraguild predation.

In this study, metabolic theory of   ecology is used to quantify the relative contributions of two broad   bacterioplankton groups, autotrophs and heterotrophs, to energy flux on   27 Pacific coral reef ecosystems experiencing human impact to varying   degrees. The effective activation energy required for photosynthesis is   lower than the average energy of activation for the biochemical   reactions of the Krebs cycle, and changes in the proportional abundance   of these two groups can greatly affect rates of energy and materials   cycling. We show that reef-water communities with a higher proportional   abundance of microbial autotrophs expend more metabolic energy per gram   of microbial biomass.

Climate-mediated disease can have severe consequences in   natural systems, particularly when ecosystem engineers, such as   habitat-formers or top predators are affected, as any impacts can   cascade throughout entire food webs. In temperate marine ecosystems,   seaweeds are the dominant habitat-formers on rocky reefs. We   investigated a putative bleaching disease affecting Delisea pulchra, a   chemically defended seaweed that occurs within a global warming   `hot-spot' and assessed how patterns of this phenomenon were influenced   by ocean temperature, solar radiation, algal chemical defences and   microbial pathogens. Warmer waters were consistently and positively   correlated with higher frequencies of bleaching in seaweed populations,   but patterns of bleaching were not consistently influenced by light   levels. Bleached thalli had low levels of antibacterial chemical   defences relative to healthy conspecifics and this was observed across   entire thalli of partially bleached algae. Microbial communities   associated with bleached algae were distinct from those on the surfaces   of healthy seaweeds. Direct testing of the importance of algal chemical   defences, done here for the first time in the field, demonstrated that   they protected the seaweed from bleaching. Treatment of algal thalli   with antibiotics reduced the severity of bleaching in experimental   algae, especially at high water temperatures. These results indicate   that bleaching in D. pulchra is the result of temperature-mediated   bacterial infections and highlight the potential for warming to   influence disease dynamics by stressing hosts.

These rates vary among taxa   due to dispersal behaviour, plot productivity and natural enemy impact.   Previous studies in aphids suggest that aphid densities are highest in   patches of intermediate sizes, and lower in small and large patches. The   suggested mechanism causing these patterns is that the dispersal   behaviour in aphids creates a mixture of area- and perimeter-dependent   migration rates. In this paper, we used these predictions to examine the   additional consequences of nutrient availability and natural enemies on   the density-area relationship. The derived predictions were compared to   data from a system with three aphid species, a set of aphid parasitoids   and generalist natural enemies, and at two levels of plant nutrient   availability. We find that predictions from the model based only on   dispersal and local growth agree with the temporal dynamics of   density-area relationships for aphids in high nutrient patches. In   patches with low nutrients, high parasitism rates appeared to cause a   negative density-area relationship for aphids, thereby deviating from   predictions driven by the aphids' dispersal behavior. Hence, the   dispersal model with scale-dependent migration rates can provide a   useful tool for understanding insect distribution in patch size   gradients, but the relative importance of top-down effects can   completely change with plot productivity.",1798,NO,RO,,,

Its distribution area and the range   of its host plants, whether they are cultivated plants or weeds, are   expanding dramatically. As no natural regression of the infestation has   been recorded so far, we undertook a detailed study of the different   steps of the biological cycle of the P. ramosa/oilseed rape pathosystem   to determine the adaptive traits that favour the parasite's success. We   combined experimental approaches involving controlled conditions with in   vitro and in pot co-cultivation on the one hand and a field trial on the   other hand. These experiments allowed us to determine a 4-mm zone around   host roots within which oilseed rape root exudates stimulate the   germination of P. ramosa, the early action of host root exudates and the   rapid fixation of the parasite on host roots. We also unveiled that P.   ramosa was able to tune its biological cycle to that of oilseed rape.   The important trophic relationships between the parasite and its host   induced phenotypic (dwarfism, leaf chlorosis, silique abortion) as well   as agronomical (90\% yield losses) consequences on oilseed rape.

A large number of migratory bird species appear to be declining as   the result of climate change, but whether resident bird species have or   will be adversely affected by climate change is less clear.

Our results indicate that the South Hills crossbill has declined by   over 60\% between 2003 and 2008, and that decreasing adult survival   drives this population decline.   3. We evaluated the relative support for multiple hypotheses linking   crossbill survival to climate, an ectoparasitic mite (scaly-leg mites   Knemidokoptes jamaicensis), and the recent emergence of West Nile virus.   Changes in adult apparent survival rate were closely associated with   average spring and annual temperatures, and with high temperatures (>=   32 degrees C) during summer, which have increased during the last   decade. In contrast, there was little evidence that scaly-leg mites or   West Nile virus contributed to recent declines in adult survival.   4. The most probable mechanism causing the decline in adult survival and   population size is a decrease in the availability of their primary food   resource, seeds in serotinous pine cones. Cone production has declined   with increasing annual temperatures, and these cones appear to be   prematurely opening owing to increasingly hot summer conditions   releasing their seeds and reducing the carrying capacity for crossbills   later in the year.   5. In light of regional climate change forecasts, which include an   increase in both annual temperature and hot days (>32 degrees C), and   the likely disappearance of lodgepole pine from southern Idaho by the   end of this century, additional research is needed to determine how to   maintain lodgepole pine forests and their supply of seeds to conserve   one of the few bird species endemic to the continental United States.",1801,NO,RO,,,

We   used a decision table to investigate how four extrinsic factors may have   contributed to these declines: food supply, predation, parasites, and   poaching, which have all been previously shown to limit Serengeti   ungulate populations. Lower recruitment likely resulted from a reduction   in diet quality, owing to the replacement of preferred trees with   unpalatable species, while decreased adult survival resulted from   illegal harvesting, which appears to have had a greater impact on   giraffe populations bordering the western and northern Serengeti.

Changes in the density of an organism near a boundary elements   (edge effects) are often thought to be generated by changes in movement   behaviour, but in most cases the mechanism underlying these effects is   unknown.   2. We quantified the movement behaviour of a minute parasitic wasp,   Anagrus columbi, in relation to edges in its habitat. This wasp attacks   eggs of the planthopper Prokelisia crocea, which inhabits a wet prairie   ecosystem composed of patches of its host plant prairie cordgrass   (Spartina pectinata) interspersed within a matrix of mudflat, smooth   brome (Bromus inermis) and native grasses. Two edge types are common in   this system, cordgrass-mudflat and cordgrass-brome.   3. We conducted mark-recapture experiments in which wasps were released   at the cordgrass-matrix edge and 50 cm within cordgrass or matrix, for   both edge types. The marked wasps were recaptured using a grid of sticky   traps. We fitted an advection-diffusion model to these data, yielding   estimates of the diffusion rate and advection coefficient for cordgrass   and matrix, for each release position and edge type.   4. The spatial distribution of wasps was well-described by the   advection-diffusion model. The pattern suggests that marked wasps   strongly biased their movements towards the edge when released in   matrix, and to a lesser extent when released in cordgrass, while edge   releases showed little bias. The advection coefficients were similar for   the two edge types, as were the diffusion rates for the three substrates   (cordgrass, brome, mudflat). The diffusive and advective components of   movement were of comparable magnitude for matrix and cordgrass releases,   suggesting equal amounts of directed and random movement.   5. Our results suggest the wasps are attracted to cordgrass patches   across short distances, and that bias in their movements may concentrate   them at the patch edge. Their edge behaviour is qualitatively different   from that of the host insect.   6.

To better understand how local and landscape factors influence natural   enemies in urban agroecosystems, we used urban community gardens as a   model system to test if and how local resource manipulation and   differences in cityscape quality affect natural enemy (ladybird beetles,   parasitoid wasps) communities and their fidelity to urban habitats.

Rather, ladybeetle fidelity to gardens was   lower in gardens in low quality cityscapes with high impervious cover.   Cityscape quality influences natural enemies in and fidelity to gardens.

Most trophic interaction theory assumes that all predators are an   abstract form of risk to which prey respond in a quantitatively similar   manner. This conceptualization can be problematic because recent   empirical work demonstrates that variation in the responses of prey to   different predators can play a key role in structuring communities and   regulating ecosystem function.   2. Predator identity - the species specific response of prey to a   predator - has been proposed as an ultimate mechanism driving the   relative contribution of indirect effects in food webs; however few   studies have explicitly tested this hypothesis.   3. This study explores the impact of predator identity on direct   consumptive (CE) and non-consumptive effects (NCEs), and on the relative   contribution of indirect, density and trait-mediated effects in trophic   cascades within host-parasitoid communities.   4. We systematically compared the individual, host-parasitoid-plant   interactions of two actively foraging parasitoid species with disparate   foraging styles, one aggressive and one furtive, a common aphid host and   plant. Our results demonstrate that the degree of risk aversion by prey   to each particular predator species (i.e. predator identity) is a key   factor driving the nature and strength of direct and indirect   transmission pathways.   5. Both parasitoid species, in general, had a negative impact on plants.   The magnitude of the aphid anti-predator dispersal response was   positively correlated with plant infestation and plant damage. The   qualitative effect of predator-induced infestation of new plants   superseded the quantitative effects of predator-mediated reductions in   aphid numbers.   6. The greatest indirect impact on plants was generated by the   aggressively foraging parasitoid, and the strength of the aphids   anti-predator response (a NCE) antagonistically traded-off with CEs due   to an increased investment in attempting to capture risk-sensitized   prey. In contrast, the furtive parasitoid did not elicit a strong   anti-predator response, had little indirect impact on plants, but   generated very high CEs due to the advantage of ovipositing into a   sedentary prey population.   7. Our data suggest the responses of prey to different predatory cues   may be an important mechanism driving the relative contribution of   transmission pathways in trophic cascades. We conclude that predator   identity is a key factor influencing the nature and strength of food web   interactions.",1807,NO,RO,,,

In a   reed-dominated estuarine tidal marsh, we examined the impacts of   insectivorous birds on three groups of insect herbivores with   concealed-feeding habits, including scale insects, gall-forming fly   larvae, and stem-boring caterpillars. Insectivorous birds attacked   14.0-75.8\% of reed shoots infested with scale insects, 13.3-20.7\% with   gall-forming fly larvae, and 8.0-100.0\% with stem-boring caterpillars.   Bird predation also significantly changed the abundance of herbivores,   reducing scale insects by 36.7-85.9\%, gall-forming fly larvae by   33.3-46.0\%, and stem-boring caterpillars by 77.0-100.0\%.

This study examined how local and landscape scale variables   associated with urbanization influenced parasitic Hymenoptera abundance   and diversity in residential and commercial properties along a rural to   urban landscape gradient in Wisconsin. At a landscape scale, 300 m   surrounding sites, land cover percentages were calculated for five cover   classes: impervious cover, forest, grassland, agriculture, and urban   green space. In addition, habitat diversity (Simpson's index) was   calculated for the landscape surrounding study sites. At a local scale   (within the boundaries of an individual property), flower diversity,   flower area, tree density, and hardscape were measured and related to   parasitoid abundance and diversity. During 2006 and 2007, parasitoids   were sampled twice a month June-August using yellow sticky cards.   Parasitoid abundance was a positive function of flower diversity, a   local scale variable. The positive relationship between parasitoid   abundance and flower diversity only occurred in areas containing high to   moderate levels of urban development, suggesting parasitoids locally   benefited from the increased availability of floral resources in urban   but not rural sites. Parasitoid diversity decreased as impervious cover   increased in the surrounding landscape. Parasitoid diversity decreased   by approximately 10\% in highly urbanized sites relative to rural sites,   a pattern driven by several parasitoid families not detected in urban   sites.

Biotic and abiotic controls underlying its distribution patterns have   been difficult to establish, but might be related to a greater capacity   of infected plants to deal with drought and herbivory. In this study we   examined the relationship between grazing intensity and symbiosis   frequency in plant species differentially preferred by herbivores. In   all the grass species found in the studied Patagonian steppe, we   determined the infection frequency along a grazing gradient by sheep   (ungrazed, moderate- and intense-grazing). Three out of five preferred   species and one out of four non-preferred species presented the   symbiosis. Within the group of species having the symbiosis, intense   grazing decreased the infection frequency of the preferred species while   the frequency of the non-preferred species remained constant. These   changes of infection frequency were correlated with changes in tiller   biomass of hosts suggesting that symbiosis frequency could depend on   overall plant performance. Our results suggest that high grazing   intensity could weaken the relationship between these endophytes and   their palatable hosts, eventually making them even more vulnerable to   further grazing.

Despite the central role of such studies in   the advancement of freshwater ecology, there has been little effort to   incorporate parasites into studies of freshwater energy flow. This   omission is particularly important considering the roles that parasites   sometimes play in shaping community structure and ecosystem processes.   Using quantitative surveys and dissections of over 1600 aquatic   invertebrate and amphibian hosts, we calculated the ecosystem-level   biomass and productivity of trematode parasites alongside the biomass of   free-living aquatic organisms in three freshwater ponds in California,   USA. Snails and amphibian larvae, which are both important intermediate   trematode hosts, dominated the dry biomass of free-living organisms   across ponds (snails=3 center dot 2gm2; amphibians=3 center dot 1gm2).   An average of 33 center dot 5\% of mature snails were infected with one   of six trematode taxa, amounting to a density of 13 infected snails m2   of pond substrate. Between 18\% and 33\% of the combined host and   parasite biomass within each infected snail consisted of larval   trematode tissue, which collectively accounted for 87\% of the total   trematode biomass within the three ponds. Mid-summer trematode dry   biomass averaged 0 center dot 10gm2, which was equal to or greater than   that of the most abundant insect orders (coleoptera=0 center dot 10gm2,   odonata=0 center dot 08gm2, hemiptera=0 center dot 07gm2 and   ephemeroptera=0 center dot 03gm2).

Given that infected snails release cercariae   for 34months a year, the pond trematode communities produced an average   of 153mgm2yr1 of dry cercarial biomass (range=70220mgm2yr1).

Previous studies revealed   that nopaline-type pathogens may expand their niche to also assimilate   octopine in the presence of nopaline, but consequences of this   phenomenon on pathogen dynamics in planta were not known. Here, we   provided molecular insight into how the transport protein NocT can bind   octopine as well as nopaline, contributing to niche expansion. We   further showed that despite the ability for niche expansion,   nopaline-type pathogens had no competitive advantage over octopine-type   pathogens in co-infected plants.

Analysis of the soil microbial community using 16 S rRNA   gene sequencing showed distinct microbiota profiles assembling by   flowering time treatment. Plant hosts grown with the   late-flowering-associated microbiomes showed consequent increases in   inflorescence biomass for three A. thaliana genotypes and an increase in   total biomass for B. rapa. The increase in biomass was correlated with   two-to five-fold enhancement of microbial extracellular enzyme   activities associated with nitrogen mineralization in soils.

Forecasts from a discrete time, stage-structured   population model assimilated with annual census and sex and age   classifications are being used annually to help park managers decide on   actions needed to meet goals for elk and vegetation. In particular, park   managers were able to determine the probability that the elk population   would fall within a desired population range, which led to both   population reduction actions and no action depending on the year of   interest. Moreover, this approach allowed multiple survey methodologies   from the last 47 years to be incorporated into a single model with   associated estimates of uncertainty.

We examined the indirect   community and ecosystem-level effects of plague to address the   hypothesis that frequent plague epizootics have a mediating effect on   the important role of prairie dogs in shaping grassland plant   communities.   We used 25 years of spatially explicit monitoring data on the Pawnee   National Grassland (Colorado, USA) to estimate frequency of plague   epizootics in prairie dog colonies.

Approximately 98\% of colonies experienced a plague epizootic within 15   years of continuous activity, nearly half remained inactive for at least   5 years following an epizootic, and less than half attained their   pre-plague area within 10 years of an epizootic.

Strong mutualistic associations are expected to arise between host   and microbial symbionts when symbionts lose sexuality, and rely strictly   on their host for reproduction via vertical transmission. The   Neotyphodium endophyte is a vertically transmitted, asexual symbiont of   pooid grasses. In agronomic grasses, Neotyphodium typically interacts   mutualistically with its host by increasing drought resistance and other   properties. However, the interaction likely depends on host and   endophyte genotypic variation, yet little is known how this variation   influences host physiological and morphological responses, especially in   wild grasses.   2. We used four different Neotyphodium-infected maternal lines of a wild   grass, Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica). Two lines harboured one   haplotype and two lines harboured a different haplotype. We   experimentally removed the endophyte from some ramets of the four lines.   We grew infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants in a greenhouse under   varying water availability.   3. We examined the effect of endophyte infection, endophyte and host   plant maternal genotype, and water availability on traditional growth   parameters. We also measured leaf net photosynthesis and dark   respiration, leaf conductance to water vapour, leaf water potential,   leaf rolling and stomatal density to provide explanations for   differences in biomass production and relative growth rates (RGR).   4. Our general findings show that Neotyphodium infection, Neotyphodium   haplotype and its interaction with host maternal genotype, and varying   water availability influence Arizona fescue physiology, growth and   biomass production. Based only on infection status, the direction of   interaction between endophyte and host is not mutualistic in terms of   host growth. Overall, endophyte haplotype and its interaction with host   maternal genotype is the most critical, and consistent factor in   influencing host growth and physiological outcomes. Variation due to   endophyte haplotype in terms of growth and physiological parameters is   often greater than that between infected and uninfected hosts.   5.

The most prevalent differences were among   locations. The transcript patterns among groups reflect the influence of   environmental factors, such as nutritional status, disease, and   xenobiotic exposure. However, these profiles also likely represent   baselines for each unique environment by which future measures can be   made to identify early indication of population-level changes due to,   for example, increasing Arctic temperatures. Some of those environmental   changes are predicted to be potentially positive for brown bears, but   other effects such as the manifestation of disease or indirect effects   of oceanic acidification may produce negative impacts.",1824,NO,RO,,,

In coastal foredunes, the   ectoparasitic nematode Tylenchorhynchus ventralis would be a major root   herbivore if not strongly controlled by soil microorganisms. Here, we   examined if the suppressive effects of the microbial enemies of T.   ventralis act by local interactions such as predation, parasitism or   antagonism, or local induction of plant defence, or by non-local   interactions, such as systemic effects when microorganisms in one   section of the plant roots can affect nematode control in another   section of the root system. We show that abundance of T. ventralis in   the root zone of the grass Ammophila arenaria is suppressed by local   interactions.   We compared local vs. non-local control of nematodes by a natural   community of soil microorganisms in a split-root experiment, where   nematodes and microbes were inoculated to the same, or to opposite root   compartments.   The split-root experiment revealed that microorganisms affected T.   ventralis numbers only when present in the same root compartment.   Therefore, the effects of microorganisms on T. ventralis are due to   local interactions and not due to induction of a systemic defence   mechanism in the plant host.   When inoculated together with microorganisms, the nematodes were heavily   infected with unknown bacteria and with fungi that resembled the genus   Catenaria, suggesting that microorganisms control nematodes through   parasitism. However, local defence induction cannot be completely   excluded.   Besides microbial enemies of nematodes, the root zone of A. arenaria   also contains plant pathogens. Root biomass was reduced by nematode   infection, but also by the combination of nematodes and microorganisms,   most likely because the soil pathogens overwhelmed the effects of   nematode control on plant production.   We conclude that there may be a trade-off between beneficial effects of   soil microorganisms on the plant host due to nematode control vs.   pathogenic effects of soil microorganisms on the plant host. We propose   that such trade-offs require more attention when studying below-ground   multitrophic interactions.",1825,MAYBE,RO,yes,,

Many of them are introduced plants, so   they pose a serious threat of biological invasions. Production of   allelopathic compounds can increase invasion success by limiting   co-occurring species in the invaded environment (novel weapons   hypothesis). In this study, we focused on plant chemistry and production   of allelopathic compounds by biofuel crops (hybrid sorrel Rumex   tianschanicus x Rumex patientia and miscanthus Miscanthus sinensis) in   comparison with invasive knotweed (Fallopia sachalinensis) and cultural   meadow species.

Miscanthus and hybrid sorrel   litter had a higher content of phenols than knotweed and cultural meadow   litter. Leachates from hybrid sorrel, miscanthus and knotweed biomass   significantly decreased seed germination of wheat and mustard in both   substrates. Soil fungal pathogens grew less vigorously on agar enriched   by leachates from both biofuel crops than on agar enriched by knotweed   and leachates.

To fulfill this goal, the National Park Service implemented a long-term   monitoring program to quantify landscape dynamics across 1.5 million ha   within and adjacent to eight national parks in the Upper Midwest United   States using an automated satellite-based change detection program   called LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and   recovery).

In this paper, we take a   mosquito-centric approach by studying mosquito states (i.e., energy,   neurological health, and toxin information state) to demonstrate how key   parameters of malaria, biting and movement rates and mosquito survival,   are all emergent properties of those states when considered in the   context of the background community interactions. We do so as follows:   First, we develop a dynamic state variable model of mosquito biting and   movement decisions that maximize mosquito expected reproductive success   (fitness), and then we embed those optimal policies in a Monte Carlo   simulation wherein mosquitoes attempt to feed on human hosts at   domiciles where insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) and insecticidal   residual wall sprays (IRSs) are used. We find that biting rates, at the   domicile level, are not impacted by mosquito state but that emigration   rates from domiciles are determined by an interaction between mosquito   energy state, information state, and risk of predation. This means that   malaria incidence, at the village level at least, may be best understood   as a response of mosquitoes to their ecological community that includes   nectar-bearing plants, predators, the spatial arrangement of homes, and   the protection of humans in those homes.",1828,NO,RO,,,

We   extend recent developments in integrated analysis and use novel methods   to produce effect size estimates that are relevant to policy makers and   include estimates of uncertainty. Results can be directly applied to   evaluate trade-offs among alternative management decisions. The methods   and results are also broadly applicable outside. sheries stock   assessment. We show that multiple factors influence populations and that   analysis of factors in isolation can be misleading. We illustrate the   framework by applying it to Pacific herring of Prince William Sound,   Alaska ( USA). The Pacific herring stock that spawns in Prince William   Sound is a stock that has collapsed, but there are several competing or   alternative hypotheses to account for the initial collapse and   subsequent lack of recovery. Factors failing the initial screening tests   for statistical significance included indicators of the 1989 Exxon   Valdez oil spill, coho salmon predation, sea lion predation, Pacific   Decadal Oscillation, Northern Oscillation Index, and effects of   containment in the herring egg-on-kelp pound fishery. The overall   results indicate that the most statistically significant factors related   to the lack of recovery of the herring stock involve competition or   predation by juvenile hatchery pink salmon on herring juveniles.   Secondary factors identified in the analysis were poor nutrition in the   winter, ocean (Gulf of Alaska) temperature in the winter, the viral   hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and the pathogen Ichthyophonus hoferi. The   implication of this result to. sheries management in Prince William   Sound is that it may well be difficult to simultaneously increase the   production of pink salmon and maintain a viable Pacific herring fishery.

In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, this situation   has already occurred and population dynamics of four widespread corals   (Acropora downingi, Porites harrisoni, Dipsastrea pallida, Cyphastrea   micropthalma) were examined across the first-ever occurrence of four   back-to-back mass mortality events (2009-2012). Mortality was driven by   diseases in 2009, bleaching and subsequent diseases in 2010/2011/2012.   2009 reduced P. harrisoni cover and size, the other events increasingly   reduced overall cover (2009: -10\%; 2010: -20\%; 2011: -20\%; 2012:   -15\%) and affected all examined species. Regeneration was only observed   after the first disturbance. P. harrisoni and A. downingi severely   declined from 2010 due to bleaching and subsequent white syndromes,   while D. pallida and P. daedalea declined from 2011 due to bleaching and   black-band disease. C. microphthalma cover was not affected. In all   species, most large corals were lost while fission due to partial tissue   mortality bolstered small size classes. This general shrinkage led to a   decrease of coral cover and a dramatic reduction of fecundity.   Transition matrices for disturbed and undisturbed conditions were   evaluated as Life Table Response Experiment and showed that C.   microphthalma changed the least in size-class dynamics and fecundity,   suggesting they were `winners'. In an ordered `degradation cascade',   impacts decreased from the most common to the least common species,   leading to step-wise removal of previously dominant species. A   potentially permanent shift from high-to low-coral cover with different   coral community and size structure can be expected due to the   demographic dynamics resultant from the disturbances. Similarities to   degradation of other Caribbean and Pacific reefs are discussed.

To   assess and project tree distributional shifts, researchers may compare   the distribution of juvenile and adult trees under the assumption that   differences between tree life stages reflect distributional shifts   triggered by climate change. However, the distribution of tree life   stages could differ within the lifespan of trees, therefore, we   hypothesize that currently observed distributional differences could   represent shifts over ontogeny as opposed to climatically driven   changes. Here, we test this hypothesis with data from 1435 plots   resurveyed after more than three decades across the Western Carpathians.   We compared seedling, sapling and adult distribution of 12 tree species   along elevation, temperature and precipitation gradients. We analyzed   (i) temporal shifts between the surveys and (ii) distributional   differences between tree life stages within both surveys. Despite   climate warming, tree species distribution of any life stage did not   shift directionally upward along elevation between the surveys. Temporal   elevational shifts were species specific and an order of magnitude lower   than differences among tree life stages within the surveys. Our results   show that the observed range shifts among tree life stages are more   consistent with ontogenetic differences in the species' environmental   requirements than with responses to recent climate change. The   distribution of seedlings substantially differed from saplings and   adults, while the distribution of saplings did not differ from adults,   indicating a critical transition between seedling and sapling tree life   stages.

In this paper we investigated how predation control cause an   increase in host growth in the abundance of hard clam (Meretrix lusoria)   populations subject to mercury (Hg)-stressed birnavirus. Here we linked   predator-prey relationships with a bioenergetic matrix population model   (MPM) associated with a susceptible-infectious-mortality (SIM) model   based on a host-pathogen-predator framework to quantify the predator   effects on population dynamics of disease in hard clam populations. Our   results indicated that relative high predation rates could promote the   hard clam abundances in relation to predators that selectively captured   the infected hard clam, by which the disease transmission was   suppressed. The results also demonstrated that predator-induced   modifications in host behavior could have potential negative or positive   effects on host growth depending on relative species density and   resource dynamics. The most immediate implication of this study for the   management of aquatic ecosystem is that, beyond the potential for   causing a growth in abundance, predation might provoke greater   predictability in aquatic ecosystem species populations and thereby   increase the safety of ecosystem production from stochastic   environmental events.

We examined the effects of these two microbial   groups on lower trophic level microbial food resources, such as   bacteria, small flagellates, and organic particles, in the water column,   and on Culex larval development and adult production. In three   independent laboratory experiments using two microeukaryote species (one   ciliate protist and one rotifer) acquired from field larval mosquito   habitats and cultured in the laboratory, we determined the effects of   Culex nigripalpus larval grazing on water column microbial dynamics,   while simultaneously monitoring larval growth and development.

Wildlife communities (especially   the large vertebrate species) are typically incompatible with   agricultural development because the opportunity costs of wildlife   conservation are unaffordable except in arid and semi-arid regions.   Ecological factors including the provision of supplementary food and   water for livestock, together with the persecution of large predators,   result in livestock replacing wildlife at biomass densities far   exceeding those of indigenous ungulates. Diseases are difficult to   eradicate from free-ranging wildlife populations and so veterinary   controls usually focus on separating commercial livestock herds from   wildlife. Persecution of large carnivores due to their depredation of   livestock has caused the virtual eradication of apex predators from most   rangelands. However, recent research points to a broad range of   solutions to reduce conflict at the live-stock-wildlife interface.   Conserving wildlife bolsters the adaptive capacity of a rangeland by   providing stakeholders with options for dealing with environmental   change. This is contingent upon local communities being empowered to   benefit directly from their wildlife resources within a management   framework that integrates land-use sectors at the landscape scale.

We first deal with resistance and   resilience against abiotic disturbance and stress. There is evidence   that soil biodiversity does confer stability to stress and disturbance,   but the mechanism is not yet fully understood. It appears to depend on   the kind of stress and disturbance and on the combination of stress and   disturbance effects. Alternatively, community structure may play a role.   Both possible explanations will guide further research. We then discuss   biotic stress. There is evidence that soil microbial diversity confers   protection against soil-borne disease, but crop and soil type and   management also play a role. Their relative importance as well as the   role of biodiversity in multitrophic interactions warrant further study.   Henceforth, we focus on the effects of plant and soil biodiversity on   nutrient and water use efficiencies as important ecological functions in   agroecosystems. The available evidence suggests that mycorrhizal   diversity positively contributes to nutrient and, possibly, water use   efficiency. Soil fauna effects on nutrient and water use efficiencies   are also apparent, but diversity effects may be indirect, through   effects on soil structure. We present a conceptual diagram relating   plant and soil biodiversity with soil structure and water and nutrient   use efficiencies as a framework for future studies. We then consider how   cropping systems design and management are interrelated and how   management options might be interfaced with farmers' knowledge in taking   management decisions. Finally, we attempt to express some economic   benefits of soil biodiversity to society as part of a wider strategy of   conserving and using agrobiodiversity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We address this issue using a   planktonic system (a zooplankton host, Daphnia dentifera, and its   virulent fungal parasite, Metschnikowia bicuspidata). Controlled   laboratory experiments, coupled with in situ field incubations of   spores, revealed that quite low levels of UVR (as well as longer   wavelength light) sharply reduced the infectivity of fungal spores but   did not affect host susceptibility to infection. The parasites   sensitivity to solar radiation may underlie patterns in a lake survey:   higher penetration of solar radiation into lakes correlated with smaller   epidemics that started later in autumn (as incident sunlight declined).

However, the   discipline of urban ecology is relatively new and one that is undergoing   rapid growth. All wildlife in urban areas will interact with humans to   some degree. With rates of urbanisation increasing globally, there is a   pressing need to understand the type and nature of human-wildlife   interactions within urban environments, to help manage, mitigate or even   promote these interactions. Much research attention has focussed on the   core topic of human-wildlife conflict. This inherent bias in the   literature is probably driven by the ease with which it can be   quantified and assessed. Human-wildlife conflicts in terms of disease   transmission, physical attack and property damage are important topics   to understand. Equally, the benefits of human-wildlife interactions are   becoming increasingly recognised, despite being harder to quantify and   generalise. Wildlife may contribute to the provision of ecosystem   services in urban areas, and some recent work has shown how interactions   with wildlife can provide a range of benefits to health and wellbeing.   More research is needed to improve understanding in this area, requiring   wildlife biologists to work with other disciplines including economics,   public health, sociology, ethics, psychology and planning. There will   always be a need to control wildlife populations in certain urban   situations to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

We consider an environment consisting of   sites interconnected by dispersal, and propose a novel mechanism of   stabilization for the case with a non-sigmoid functional response of   predators. We assume that the carrying capacity of the prey is   infinitely large in each site, and show that successful top-down   regulation of this otherwise globally unstable system is made possible   through an interplay between the unevenness of prey fitness across the   sites and the rapid food-dependent migration of predators. We argue that   this mechanism of stabilization is different from those previously   reported in the literature: in particular, it requires a high degree of   synchronicity in local oscillations of species densities across the   sites. Prey outbreaks take place synchronously, but the unevenness of   prey growth rates across the sites results in a pronounced difference in   the species densities, and so the predator quickly disperses to the   sites with the highest prey abundances. For this reason, the consumption   of prey mostly takes place in the sites with high densities of prey,   which assures an efficient suppression of outbreaks. Furthermore, when   the total size of prey population is low, the distribution of both   species among the sites becomes more even, and this prevents   overconsumption of the prey by the predator. Finally, we put forward the   hypothesis that this mechanism, when considered in a tri-trophic   plankton community in the water column, can explain the stability of the   nutrient-rich low-chlorophyll open ocean regions.

The grass   treatment, irrespective of earthworm presence, resutted in a tower soil   pH, increased the proportion of large soil. aggregates and increased the   abundance of mites, collembolans and nematodes. The microbial biomass   (SIR) was increased by grass incorporation, as a result of an increase   in growing microbial biomass. When earthworms were present, the response   of the microbial community was more pronounced, and the organic   material. was mineralised more efficiently, leading to a higher   percentage ash content of the soil. In contrary to these changes,   clubroot disease severity did not differ among the treatments at any   specific sampling. Across all samplings, however, disease severity was   higher in the grass treatment without earthworms compared with the   control treatment. The result contradicts earlier studies on earthworm   effects on P brassicae. The importance of different earthworm species on   the interaction is discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The greatest degree of abundance of soil-free-living   nematodes (88\%) was found in the upper (0-10 cm) soil layer. Plant   parasites were the most abundant trophic group under the two plants (58   and 36\% under Parkinsonia (Cercidium) praecox and Prosopis laevigata,   respectively), whereas omnivore-predators were the most dominant (96\%)   in inter-plant spaces.

Pathways describe the processes that result in the introduction of   alien species from one location to another. A framework is proposed to   facilitate the comparative analysis of invasion pathways by a wide range   of taxa in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Comparisons with a   range of data helped identify existing gaps in current knowledge of   pathways and highlight the limitations of existing legislation to manage   introductions of alien species. The scheme aims for universality but   uses the European Union as a case study for the regulatory perspectives.   2. Alien species may arrive and enter a new region through three broad   mechanisms: importation of a commodity, arrival of a transport vector,   and/or natural spread from a neighbouring region where the species is   itself alien. These three mechanisms result in six principal pathways:   release, escape, contaminant, stowaway, corridor and unaided.   3. Alien species transported as commodities may be introduced as a   deliberate release or as an escape from captivity. Many species are not   intentionally transported but arrive as a contaminant of a commodity,   for example pathogens and pests. Stowaways are directly associated with   human transport but arrive independently of a specific commodity, for   example organisms transported in ballast water, cargo and airfreight.   The corridor pathway highlights the role transport infrastructures play   in the introduction of alien species. The unaided pathway describes   situations where natural spread results in alien species arriving into a   new region from a donor region where it is also alien.   4. Vertebrate pathways tend to be characterized as deliberate releases,   invertebrates as contaminants and plants as escapes. Pathogenic   micro-organisms and fungi are generally introduced as contaminants of   their hosts. The corridor and unaided pathways are often ignored in   pathway assessments but warrant further detailed consideration.   5. Synthesis and applications. Intentional releases and escapes should   be straightforward to monitor and regulate but, in practice, developing   legislation has proved difficult. New introductions continue to occur   through contaminant, stowaway, corridor and unaided pathways. These   pathways represent special challenges for management and legislation.   The present framework should enable these trends to be monitored more   clearly and hopefully lead to the development of appropriate regulations   or codes of practice to stem the number of future introductions.",1842,NO,RO,,,

However, it is poorly   understood whether and how large vertebrate herbivores and plant-soil   feedback effects interact. Here, we study the response of grassland   plant species to grazing-induced legacy effects in the soil and we   explore whether these plant responses can help us to understand   long-term vegetation dynamics in the field.   In a greenhouse experiment we tested the response of four grassland   plant species, Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus and   Rumex acetosa, to field-conditioned soils from grazed and ungrazed   grassland. We relate these responses to long-term vegetation data from a   grassland exclosure experiment in the field.   In the greenhouse experiment, we found that total biomass production and   biomass allocation to roots was higher in soils from grazed than from   ungrazed plots. There were only few relationships between plant   production in the greenhouse and the abundance of conspecifics in the   field. Spatiotemporal patterns in plant community composition were more   stable in grazed than ungrazed grassland plots, but were not related to   plant-soil feedbacks effects and biomass allocation patterns.   We conclude that grazing-induced soil legacy effects mainly influenced   plant biomass allocation patterns, but could not explain altered   vegetation dynamics in grazed grasslands. Consequently, the direct   effects of grazing on plant community composition (e.g. through   modifying light competition or differences in grazing tolerance) appear   to overrule indirect effects through changes in plant-soil feedback.",1843,NO,RO,,,

An efficient disposal/reuse option was sought for reed bed   biosolids accumulated over a 15-year period at a wastewater treatment   facility in New Jersey, USA. The study facility had 14 reed beds, each   with 1000 wet tons capacity, which were full, and so the solids needed   to be removed. Because P. australis is considered an invasive species in   New Jersey and several other states in the United States, disposal or   reuse of solids containing this plant is regulated. Composting was   examined as a potential treatment for destroying the plant's   reproductive rhizomes. The high temperatures achieved during composting   were also tested to determine if regulatory criteria for pathogen   reduction could be met, making the composted product suitable for   unrestricted land application. Preliminary studies indicated the sludge   had stabilized to the point where self-heating did not occur. Among the   carbon amendments tested in the laboratory to stimulate compositing   activity, Phragmites above-ground biomass was determined to be most   suitable. In a field test, Phragmites above-ground biomass was mixed   with reed bed biosolids at a 1: 2 (w/w) ratio. The temperatures achieved   resulted in complete mortality of Phragmites rhizomes.

We develop   a nutrient-limited food web model to investigate how manipulation of   intermediate host susceptibility, nutrient supply, and predator   diversity determine parasite abundance and infection prevalence in   intermediate and definitive hosts. We show that the effects of   intermediate host manipulation on parasite abundance and infection   prevalence depend on nutrient supply while the coexistence of competing   definitive hosts and ``dead-ends'' (where parasites cannot reproduce)   depends primarily on intermediate host susceptibility to predation.

During 1993-1999 and 2001-2002, we measured   frequencies of parasitism and examined how differences in size of host,   life-history traits, and behavior, as well as aspects of behavior of   brown-headed cowbirds (i.e., removal of eggs of host and multiple   parasitism), influenced reproductive success of blue-gray gnatcatchers   (Polioptila caerulea), plumbeous vireos (Vireo plumbens), and western   tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana). Brown-headed cowbirds parasitized 79\%   of 288 nests of blue-gray gnatcatchers, 84\% of 170 nests of plumbeous   vireos, and 76\% of 129 nests of western tanagers. Parasitism reduced   productivity of hosts through removal of eggs, reduced hatching success,   reduced survival of nestlings, and desertion of nest. Relative to   unparasitized nests, size of clutch of singly parasitized nests was   reduced, on average, by 0.3 eggs for the plumbeous vireo and by 0.8 eggs   for the two other species. Both blue-gray gnatcatchers and plumbeous   vireos rarely fledged any of their own young from parasitized nests,   whereas western tanagers did so regularly. All three species deserted   some nests in association with parasitism, but the primary response to   parasitism was acceptance of eggs from brown-headed cowbirds. Multiple   parasitism was common, however, mean number of young of hosts that   fledged only differed between singly and multiply parasitized nests for   the western tanager due to high costs of single parasitism for the   blue-gray gnatcatcher and plumbeous vireo. Overall, costs of parasitism   were negatively correlated to body size of host; parasitism caused   failure of 58\% of nests of blue-gray gnatcatchers, 49\% of nests of   plumbeous vireos, and 22\% of nests of western tanagers.",1846,NO,RO,,,

Variation in   aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus is maintained by balancing   selection, but the ecological function and impact on fungal fitness of   this compound are unknown. We hypothesize that balancing selection for   aflatoxin production in A. flavus is driven by interaction with insects.   To test this, we competed naturally occurring aflatoxigenic and   non-aflatoxigenic fungal isolates against Drosophila larvae on medium   containing 0-1750 ppb aflatoxin, using quantitative PCR to quantify A.   flavus DNA as a proxy for fungal fitness. The addition of aflatoxin   across this range resulted in a 26-fold increase in fungal fitness. With   no added toxin, aflatoxigenic isolates caused higher mortality of   Drosophila larvae and had slightly higher fitness than non-aflatoxigenic   isolates. Additionally, aflatoxin production increased an average of   1.5-fold in the presence of a single larva and nearly threefold when the   fungus was mechanically damaged. We argue that the role of aflatoxin in   protection from fungivory is inextricably linked to its role in   interference competition.

Testing environmental effects of pharmaceutical   residues is therefore often mandated in form of single-species   ecotoxicological laboratory tests, yet differential sensitivity of   species can ultimately disturb the entire community. A more realistic   approach is to directly assess toxicity in the field to account for   spatio-temporal variation in climate and habitat. We conducted the first   field study at the landscape scale, replicated al 24 Swiss farms north   of the Alps, to test the impact of a realistically low concentration   (6,6 mu g/kg fresh dung) of the popular parasiticide ivermeain on the   beneficial cow dung insect community over the season, We found a graded   negative impact of ivermectin on many but not all species, with   significant reductions in ca. one third of 32 evaluated fly (Diptera)   and wasp (Hymenoptera) taxa, No taxon benefited from ivermectin   presence. Small hymenopteran parasitoids particularly decreased in   numbers (62\%), with large dipteran predators (38\%) being reduced more   than primary coprophagous dung consumers (234), This supports   theoretical expectations that the [op trophic levels of a community   are particularly vulnerable to environmental disturbance because their   numbers tend to be low and their body size large, hut also because   pollutants can biomagnify in the food chain. Sensitivity to pollutants   may further exhibit a phylogenetic signal. Ivermectin residues thus   generally reduced the biodiversity of the dung insect community, but   impact varied among farms, years and over the season, being lowest in   autumn. We conclude that spatio-temporal replication of such higher-tier   field studies is advised to capture the full extent of effects in   realistic natural settings, as even low concentrations of a   pharmaceutical can have varying impact on the different organisms   comprising an ecosystem.",1848,NO,RO,,,

Bi-directional consumer-resource (C-R) interactions have been the object   of recent theory. In these interactions, each species acts, in some   respects, as both a consumer and a resource of the other, which is the   basis of many mutualisms. In uni-directional C-R interactions between   two species, one acts as a consumer and the other as a material and/or   energy resource, while neither acts as both. The relationship between   insect pollinator/seed parasites and the host plant is an example of the   latter interaction type of C-R, as the insect provides no material   resource to the plant (though it provides a pollination service). In   this paper we consider a different variation of the uni-directional C-R   interaction, in which the resource species has both positive and   negative effects on the consumer species, while the consumer has only a   negative effect on the resource. A predator-prey system in which the   prey is able to kill or consume predator eggs or larvae is an example.   Our aim is to demonstrate mechanisms by which interaction outcomes of   this system vary with different conditions, and thus to extend the   uni-directional C-R theory established by Holland and DeAngelis (2009).   By the analysis of a specific two-species system, it is shown that there   is no periodic solution of the system, and the parameter (factor) space   can be divided into six regions, which correspond to   predation/parasitism, amensalism, and competition. The interaction   outcomes of the system transition smoothly when the parameters are   changed continuously in the six regions and/or initial densities of the   species vary in a smooth fashion. Varying a pair of parameters can also   result in the transitions.

Local-scale factors are of high   relevance to farmers striving for enhanced conservation biological   control. However, particularly in perennial cropping systems, knowledge   is limited on which and how local factors affect the effectiveness of   parasitoids as natural enemies of pests. Focussing on parasitism of the   apple blossom weevil Anthonomus pomorum by native parasitic wasps in   fruit orchards adjacent to forests, we quantified the effects of the   following potential determinants of the ecosystem service `parasitism':   (1) apple cultivar, (2) presence of ants, (3) distance between apple   trees and forest (edge effects), and (4) environmental variability   (temperature and precipitation patterns in five study years; orchard   clearcut as a fundamental change in land-use). Apple cultivars varied   significantly in flowering phenology and blossom size. Parasitism of A.   pomorum by hymenopteran parasitoids differed consistently among apple   cultivars across years. Weevil infestation of trees was also   significantly affected by apple cultivar. Ant exclusion from apple trees   significantly increased parasitism in one apple cultivar. Parasitism was   higher on potted phytometer trees close to forest than on those distant   from forest. Parasitism differed significantly among study years.   Across-year parasitism levels were more similar for overall parasitism   than for parasitism by the key parasitoid, the ichneumonid Scambus   pomorum alone. Parasitism on potted trees remained high for the two   years following orchard clearcut, whereas weevil infestation was   significantly reduced in the second year after clearcut. This study   shows that local-scale factors including crop cultivar, presence of ants   that act as antagonists of parasitoids, and within-field position of   crop plants may affect the ecosystem service of parasitism, and hence   can be applied to improve natural pest control.

In order to study the interaction   between AM fungi and PSB, we used Bacillus megateritum, a PSB isolated   from the sterilized surface of AM germinated spores, and two strains of   the AM fungus Gloms intraradices with different mycelial architecture. A   greenhouse experiment was designed with maize as host plant with the   addition of tribasic calcium phosphate. We tested the hypothesis that   PSB, intimately linked with AM fungi, could interact differentially with   the two AM strains. We concluded that inoculation with the PSB   positively affected maize mycorrhization. Insoluble phosphate alone did   not influence the AM extraradical mycelium (ERM) length and maize   mycorrhization when bacteria were not inoculated. The results provide   evidence that the adverse effect on infectivity for some AM strains   might be caused by solubilized phosphorus release to the rhizosphere by   PSB. Differences related to the mycelium architecture of each AM strain   were observed: the density of PSB in rhizosphere soil was significantly   higher only with the GA8 strain coinciding with the highest values of   maize biomass. The density of bacteria associated with GA8 mycelium   could be the result of the transfer of photosynthates through the   rhizosphere: this close contact would favor the persistence of the   intimate relationship between PSB and AM hyphae. In the bacteria-free   treatments. soil adherence was not significantly altered. Although the   highest development of ERM occurred with GA5, plants inoculated with GA8   showed the highest values for soil adherence. This may be due to the AM   mycelium which modifies bacterial persistence in the rhizosphere and   consequently soil adherence. Our results show that for potential   applications, some characteristics of the AM strains are key in the   selection of the AM fungi-PSB combinations. These include the tolerance   to soluble phosphorus, the rate of root colonization, and ERM   development that favors the persistence of bacteria in rhizosphere soil.   (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

To clarify whether yield increase during organic transition is   caused by improvement of soil microbial activities, we compared   identically managed organic and conventional plots of 1-year lettuce   (Lactuca sativa L.)-carrot (Daucus carota L.) rotation for 3 years   (organic plots: first 3years after switching from conventional to   organic management; conventional plots: managed in the same way as   organic plots for 3years but receiving chemical fertilizer, fungicide,   insecticide and herbicide) in an Andosol field. During organic   transition, yields of organic lettuce and carrots were lower than those   of conventional lettuce and carrots for only the first year. Yield drop   and recovery of lettuce were thought to be caused by changes in the   amount of N uptake, though yield fluctuation of carrots was mainly   caused by damage from insects. Although soil enzyme activities may be   responsible for N mineralization, various soil enzyme activities   promptly responded to organic amendment to become higher under organic   management than under conventional management even after the first   lettuce cropping (6months after switching to organic management; much   shorter than the period of organic transition). However, discriminant   analysis using activities of six soil enzymes (dehydrogenase,   beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase, cellulase and   protease) indicated that 18-24 months (a period close to that of the   organic transition) were needed for the pattern of various soil enzyme   activities to be in a steady state after switching to organic   management. The pattern of soil enzyme activities fluctuating to a   plateau during the second lettuce cropping seemed to show a tendency   similar to that of N uptake and yield of lettuce during organic   transition. Soil available N in organic plots also became higher than   that in conventional plots in the third year. These results suggested   that improved N uptake and yield of lettuce during organic transition in   an Andosol might be caused by either improvement in various soil enzyme   activities or accumulation of soil available N. Yield response of   carrots demanding less N was attributed not to N mineralization but to   damage from insects.",1854,NO,RO,,,

However, methods commonly used to quantify tree death, such   as relating tree mortality risk solely to diameter growth, almost   certainly do not account for important spatial processes. Our goal in   this study was to detect and, if present, to quantify the relevance of   such processes. For this purpose, we examined purely spatial aspects of   mortality for four species, Abies concolor, Abies magnifica, Calocedrus   decurrens, and Pinus lambertiana, in an old-growth conifer forest in the   Sierra Nevada of California, USA. The analysis was performed using data   from nine fully mapped long-term monitoring plots.   In three cases, the results unequivocally supported the inclusion of   spatial information in models used to predict mortality. For Abies   concolor, our results suggested that growth rate may not always   adequately capture increased mortality risk due to competition. We also   found evidence of a facilitative effect for this species, with mortality   risk decreasing with proximity to conspecific neighbors. For Pinus   lambertiana, mortality risk increased with density of conspecific   neighbors, in keeping with a mechanism of increased pathogen or insect   pressure ( i.e., a Janzen-Connell type effect). Finally, we found that   models estimating risk of being crushed were strongly improved by the   inclusion of a simple index of spatial proximity.   Not only did spatial indices improve models, those improvements were   relevant for mortality prediction. For P. lambertiana, spatial factors   were important for estimation of mortality risk regardless of growth   rate. For A. concolor, although most of the population fell within   spatial conditions in which mortality risk was well described by growth,   trees that died occurred outside those conditions in a disproportionate   fashion. Furthermore, as stands of A. concolor become increasingly   dense, such spatial factors are likely to become increasingly important.   In general, models that fail to account for spatial pattern are at risk   of failure as conditions change.",1855,NO,RO,,,

Biggins",2017,Paltry Past-Precipitation: Predisposing Prairie Dogs to Plague?,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,990-998,990-998,10.1002/jwmg.21281,"The plague bacterium Yersinia pestis was introduced to California in   1900 and spread rapidly as a sylvatic disease of mammalian hosts and   flea vectors, invading the Great Plains in the United States by the   1930s to 1940s. In grassland ecosystems, plague causes periodic,   devastating epizootics in colonies of blacktailed prairie dogs (Cynomys   ludovicianus), sciurid rodents that create and maintain subterranean   burrows. In doing so, plague inhibits prairie dogs from functioning as   keystone species of grassland communities. The rate at which fleas   transmit Y. pestis is thought to increase when fleas are abundant. Flea   densities can increase during droughts when vegetative production is   reduced and herbivorous prairie dogs are malnourished and have weakened   defenses against fleas. Epizootics of plague have erupted frequently in   prairie dogs during years in which precipitation was plentiful, and the   accompanying cool temperatures might have facilitated the rate at which   fleas transmitted Y. pestis. Together these observations evoke the   hypothesis that transitions from dry-to-wet years provide conditions for   plague epizootics in prairie dogs. Using generalized linear models, we   analyzed a 24-year dataset on the occurrence of plague epizootics in 42   colonies of prairie dogs from Colorado, USA, 1982-2005. Of the 33   epizootics observed, 52\% erupted during years with increased   precipitation in summer. For the years with increased summer   precipitation, if precipitation in the prior growing season declined   from themaximum of 502mmto the minimum of 200 mm, the prevalence of   plague epizootics was predicted to increase 3-fold. Thus, reduced   precipitation may have predisposed prairie dogs to plague epizootics   when moisture returned. Biologists sometimes assume dry conditions are   detrimental for plague. However, 48\% of epizootics occurred during   years in which precipitation was scarce in summer. In some cases, an   increased abundance of fleas during dry years might compensate for other   conditions that become less favorable for plague transmission. Global   warming is forecasted to amplify the hydrological cycle in the Great   Plains, causing an increased occurrence of prolonged droughts interceded   by brief periods of intense precipitation. Results herein suggest these   changes might affect plague cycles in prairie dogs. Both negative and   positive consequences of dry conditions should be considered when   managing plague.

Conversion to less intensive row crop   agricultural management systems such as biologically-based organic and   no-till may reduce the negative effects of conventional management to AM   fungi. In this study, AM fungus activity (via glomalin production),   spore diversity, community structure, and community stability were   surveyed over 20 years in no-till, biologically-based organic, and   conventionally managed plots at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station Long   Term Ecological Research Site in Michigan, USA. A complementary   greenhouse experiment tested for direct effects of AM fungal inocula   from these different agricultural management treatments on growth of   corn and wheat plants. Soil glomalin increased in no-till and organic   management systems, most likely due to decreases in disturbance   associated with tillage and chemical inputs. No-till management slightly   increased AM fungus diversity and community stability. AM fungus   community structure significantly differed between conventional and   no-till treatments, with an indicator species analysis showing that   Acaulospora spp. were characteristic of conventional management, while   Glomus spp. and Gigaspora spp. were associated with no-till management.   AM fungal inocula from organically managed treatments increased wheat,   but not corn, growth. Overall, conversion from long-term conventional   row crop agricultural management to no-till or biologically-based   organic systems increased soil glomalin, but did not uniformly improve   AM fungus diversity or crop plant benefits. In the future, novel   agricultural systems combining organic management with conservation   tillage may further improve AM fungal benefits to soils and crops.

A scaled response relative to herbivory levels and nutrient availability   would be adaptive, particularly under nutrient-limited conditions, in   minimizing the costs of expressed defensive pathways and synthesis. In   this study, we investigated effects of varying nitrogen (N)   fertilization (42, 112, 196, and 280 ppm N) on levels of cotton plant   (Gossypium hirsutum) phytohormones [jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic   acid (SA)], terpenoid aldehydes (hemigossypolone, heliocides H(1), H(2),   H(3), and H(4)), and volatile production in response to beet armyworm   (Spodoptera exigua) herbivory. Additional bioassays assessed parasitoid   (Cotesia marginiventris) host-searching success in response to cotton   plants grown under various N fertilizer regimes. At low N input (42 ppm   N), herbivore damage resulted in significant increases in local leaf   tissue concentrations of JA and volatiles and in systemic accumulation   of terpenoid aldehydes. However, increased N fertilization of cotton   plants suppressed S. exigua-induced plant hormones and led to reduced   production of various terpenoid aldehydes in damaged mature leaves and   undamaged young leaves. While increased N fertilization significantly   diminished herbivore-induced leaf volatile concentrations, the   parasitism of S. exigua larvae by the parasitoid C. marginiventris in   field cages did not differ among N treatments. This suggests that,   despite significant N fertilization effects on herbivore-induced plant   defenses, at short range, the parasitoids were unable to differentiate   between S. exigua larvae feeding on physiologically different cotton   plants that share large constitutive volatile pools releasable when   damaged by herbivores.",1860,NO,RO,,,

In North   Dakota, USA, mortality was similar and typically low for adult female   bighorn sheep from Montana (0.090.029 [SE]) and British Columbia (0.08   +/- 0.017) during 2000-2016. Median life expectancy was 11 years for   females that reached adulthood (2 yrs old); however, mortality   accelerated with age and reached 86\% by age 16. Mortalities resulted   primarily from low rates of predation, disease, accidents, and unknown   natural causes (<0.04 [upper 90\% CI]). Similar survival rates of   female bighorn sheep from female bighorn sheep from British Columbia and   Montana, coupled with greater recruitment of bighorn sheep from Montana,   resulted in a greater projected rate of increase for the MT ecotype   (=1.21) than for the BC ecotype (1.02), and a more youthful age   structure. These results support translocation of bighorn sheep from   areas that are environmentally similar to areas that will be stocked.

To study species persistence under global   climate change, it is critical to consider the ecology and evolution of   multispecies interactions; however, the sheer number of potential   interactions makes a full study of all interactions unfeasible. One   mechanistic approach to solving the problem of complicated community   context to global change is to (i) define strategy groups of species   based on life-history traits, trophic position, or location in the   ecosystem, (ii) identify species involved in key interactions within   these groups, and (iii) determine from the interactions of these key   species which traits to study in order to understand the response to   global warming.

Edge   effects were dominated by fruit removal, which increased with the   distance to the edge, height in the canopy and fruit availability. As a   result, plant reproduction (in terms of seeds produced and fruits   removed, which putatively leads to higher seed dispersal) decreased   strongly near to forest edges. In contrast, visitation rates of the main   pollinator (the hummingbird) were unaffected by edges, and their strong   effects on fruit set (including the alleviation of quality pollen   limitation arising in the forest interior) might be mitigating the   decrease in bumblebee visitation near to forest edges.

However, the amphipod commonly serves as second intermediate   host for detrimental microphallid trematodes. This host parasite   association is potentially very sensitive to climate change as the   transmission rate of larval trematodes (cercariae) from first   intermediate hosts (mud snails) to amphipods, and hence infection   intensity-dependent amphipod mortality, generally accelerates with   increasing temperature. Given the ecosystem engineering role of C.   volutator, we hypothesized that elevated temperature, indirectly through   increased parasite-induced amphipod mortality, significantly affects the   structure of the surrounding benthic community. To test this, we   performed a three-month outdoor mesocosm experiment exposing a natural   soft-bottom community of benthic plants and animals to four different   treatments: relatively low mean water temperature (18 degrees C) with   low (<4\%) and high (c. 31\%) trematode prevalence in the snail   population, and relatively high mean water temperature (22 degrees C)   with low and high trematode prevalence. Both temperature and snail   parasitism had a significant impact on amphipod abundance and resulted   in their almost complete eradication at the warm temperature with high   parasitism. Aside from the amphipod hosts, increased temperature   affected the abundance of eight faunal species out of 22 in total   (36\%), whereas increased level of parasitism or the parasite   temperature interaction influenced the density of three species (14\%).   The treatment-determined Corophium abundance played an isolated role for   several species, particularly the polychaetes Hediste diversicolor   (positive) and Polydora ligni (negative). Regarding primary producers,   the overall frequency distribution of 21 species of benthic diatoms   differed between all four treatments. Species-specific effects were few   and weak, however, and microalgal abundance (chlorophyll-a) was   statistically unaffected by treatments, together suggesting a rather   resilient plant community towards the experimental perturbations. At the   community level, the non-host macrofaunal diversity decreased with   temperature in the low parasitism treatments whereas it increased with   temperature in the high parasitism treatments. This suggests that   sufficiently high levels of parasitism may turn a negative effect of   elevated temperature on macrofaunal biodiversity into a positive effect.   Hence, our experiment demonstrates that the synergy between parasitism   and a relevant temperature increase, e.g. in lieu of climate   oscillations or global warming, may have broad ecological consequences   for the organization and function of soft-bottom communities, in part   through elevated parasite-induced mortality of a central community   member.

This study assessed   how successional changes of the vegetation influenced the composition of   the flower-visiting insect assemblages of two plant species,   Leucanthemopsis alpina (L.) Heyw. and Saxifraga bryoides L., selected as   the only two insect-pollinated species occurring along the whole   succession. In addition, we investigated the links between reproductive   output of these plants and pollinator abundance through experimental   exclusion of pollinators. Plant community structure changed along the   succession, affecting the distribution and the abundance of insects via   idiosyncratic responses of different insect functional groups. L. alpina   interacted with ubiquitously distributed pollinators, while S. bryoides   pollinators were positively associated with insect-pollinated plant   species density and S. bryoides abundance. With succession proceeding,   insect assemblages became more functionally diverse, with the abundance   of parasitoids, predators and opportunists positively related to an   increase in plant cover and diversity. The reproductive output of both   plant species varied among successional stages. Contrary to our   expectation, the obligate insect-pollinated L. alpina showed a   reproductive output rather independent from pollinator abundance, while   the reproductive output of the self-fertile S. bryoides seemed linked to   pollinator abundance. Observing ecological interactions and using   functional traits, we provided a mechanistic understanding of community   assembly processes along a successional gradient. Plant community   diversity and cover likely influenced insect community assembly through   bottom-up effects. In turn, pollinators regulate plant reproductive   output through top-down control.

The genetic data indicated substantial reproductive   isolation, which could have resulted in adaptive or random changes   responsible for the differences in host compatibility.   5. We showed that experimental testing of physiological host   compatibility can be effectively used for the detection of different MUs   of U. crassus, with direct implications for the management of host   populations. In combination with traditional genetic and morphometric   techniques, this approach may provide a general framework for the   recognition and care of management units of affiliate species.   6. Synthesis and applications. Population-level evaluations of host   compatibility should be utilized in management unit recognition and the   formulation of management targets for affiliate species. We demonstrated   that small-scale cross-compatibility testing can be effectively used to   diagnose the sources of variability in host relationships with direct   management implications. This approach can enhance the targeting of   management actions in many biological applications addressing species   conservation, biological invasions and ecosystem processes.",1870,NO,RO,,,

The principles of life-history theory suggest that   this size reduction could evolve if the infection reduces predation   pressure.   Question: Does the endophyte protect grass seedlings against herbivory?   Hypothesis: Herbivores consume more seedlings that develop from   endophyte-free grass seeds than from endophyte-infected grass seeds.   Organisms: Epichloe typhina is the seed-transmitted endophytic fungus,   the weeping alkaligrass (Puccinellia distans) seedlings are the hosts,   and the grove snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is the herbivore.   Methods: Our experiment consisted of two 66-h food-choice tests. The   tests were performed consecutively and on the same individual snails. We   offered snails freshly harvested weeping alkaligrass seedlings with and   without the endophyte.   Results: Starved snails consumed approximately 20\% less biomass of   infected seedlings than uninfected seedlings. When the same snails were   tested again shortly after their first contact with the endophyte, they   exhibited an approximately 40\% reduction in seedling consumption, and   food discrimination became undetectable.   Conclusions: Toxins produced by endophytic fungi reduce the   vulnerability of grass seedlings to snail herbivory",1871,NO,RO,,,

Austropuccinia psidii   (myrtle rust) is a pathogenic fungus native to South America that   affects species in the plant family Myrtaceae. The pathogen was   introduced accidentally to Australia and first detected in NSW in April   2010. Ecological impacts have been poorly studied in the native range of   A.psidii and even less in its Australian introduced range. In order to   assess the potential impact of A.psidii on coastal swamp woodland, two   glasshouse experiments were conducted using three co-occurring species:   Melaleuca quinquenervia, Leptospermum laevigatum and Baeckea linifolia.   Plants of each species were grown individually (Experiment 1) and in   mixed species assemblages (Experiment 2), with half inoculated with   A.psidii and the other half remaining as controls. Infection level was   assessed and impact on seedling survival and growth recorded. In both   experiments L.laevigatum and M.quinquenervia seedlings were heavily   infected and showed high degrees of susceptibility with negative effects   on growth (height, biomass and number of leaves). In contrast, no   B.linifolia seedling presented visible symptoms of disease, although   seedlings showed reduced growth. Melaleuca quinquenervia seedlings had   greater infection levels and suffered greater growth reductions than   L.laevigatum in both experiments. However, there was no significant   difference in the relative abundance of the three species in the   mixed-species experiment. This study provides a better understanding of   the potential impacts of A.psidii in this vegetation community and has   significant implications for the conservation and management of   Australian Myrtaceae-dominated plant communities generally.",1872,NO,RO,,,

Viticulture is a very important economic   activity in most countries with Mediterranean climate, often shaping   their landscapes and culture. Grape production is affected by a number   of pests and diseases, and farmers use prophylactic and response-driven   pesticides to control these pests. Here we quantified the main biotic   causes of crop losses in four grape castes, two red (Touriga Nacional   and Baga) and two white (Arinto and Chardonnay), and evaluated the   potential effect of native biodiversity to provide biotic resistance to   pest outbreaks and grape losses. Specifically, the diversity and   abundance of bird and insect communities in these vineyards were   quantified and divided into functional guilds (pest, neutral or   auxiliary), to test whether these natural communities hold the potential   to naturally control grape pests (biotic resistance hypothesis) under   normal vineyard management (including pesticide application regimes). A   potential association between distance to the vineyard edge and grape   losses was also evaluated. We recorded a very small proportion of grape   losses (mean = 0.6 \%; max = 7.5 \%), with insect pests showing a   preference for the castes Baga (red) and Chardonnay (white), while bird   pests avoided the caste Arinto (white). Grape color did not influence   losses caused by insect pests, but birds showed a preference for red   castes. The caste Baga was also more vulnerable to losses caused by   fungi. Despite their low impact on grape production, most insects and   birds detected in the six vineyards were pests, which entails a   potentially low level of biotic resistance in this highly managed   agricultural ecosystem. Further research is necessary to fully evaluate   the role of functional biodiversity in vineyards, particularly if   alternative production processes, such as organic farming, can increase   the potential of native biodiversity to protect against grape losses   from pests under lower regimes of chemical spraying.",1873,NO,RO,,,

Widespread declines in vulture   populations could increase the availability of carrion to other   organisms, but the ways facultative scavengers might respond to this   increase have not been thoroughly explored. We aimed to determine   whether facultative scavengers increase carrion consumption in the   absence of vulture competition and whether they are capable of   functionally replacing vultures in the removal of carrion biomass from   the landscape. We experimentally excluded 65 rabbit carcasses from   vultures during daylight hours and placed an additional 65 carcasses   that were accessible to vultures in forested habitat in South Carolina,   USA during summer (June-August). We used motion-activated cameras to   compare carrion use by facultative scavenging species between the   experimental and control carcasses. Scavenging by facultative scavengers   did not increase in the absence of competition with vultures. We found   no difference in scavenger presence between control carcasses and those   from which vultures were excluded. Eighty percent of carcasses from   which vultures were excluded were not scavenged by vertebrates, compared   to 5\% of carcasses that were accessible to vultures. At the end of the   7-day trials, there was a 10.1-fold increase in the number of   experimental carcasses that were not fully scavenged compared to   controls. Facultative scavengers did not functionally replace vultures   during summer in our study. This finding may have been influenced by the   time of the year in which the study took place, the duration of the   trials, and the spacing of carcass sites. Our results suggest that under   the warm and humid conditions of our study, facultative scavengers would   not compensate for loss of vultures. Carcasses would persist longer in   the environment and consumption of carrion would likely shift from   vertebrates to decomposers. Such changes could have substantial   implications for disease transmission, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem   functioning.",1874,NO,RO,,,

The   effects are much stronger and more prevalent if plants are grown in   interspecific competition. Using several soil treatments (gamma   irradiation, activated carbon, fungicide, fertilizer) we show that the   mechanism of the negative feedback is the buildup of soil pathogens   which reduce the competitive ability of nearly all species when grown on   soils they have formerly occupied. We further show that the magnitude of   the change in competitive outcome is sufficient to stabilize observed.   fitness differences between functional groups in reasonably large   communities.

We report for the first time that parasitic   larvae (glochidia) of the invasive freshwater mussel Sinanodonta   (Anodonta) woodiana (Unionidae, Bivalvia) cause an unexpected reduction   in the condition factor of parasitized native fish species. The   reduction in the body mass and condition factor of experimentally   infested European chub (Squalius cephalus) was associated with changes   in several physiological parameters measured in host fish plasma. Ion   concentrations (potassium, chloride) and enzymes activities (aspartate   aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase,   alkaline phosphatase) were significantly affected; hence, the results   reveal the complex effects of non-native glochidia on the homeostasis of   the individually tested fish. Changes in host physiology and condition   status were recorded also in environmentally relevant infestation   intensities (mean of 3.02 +/- 0.51 glochidia g(-1)). Despite intensive   concern regarding the negative biodiversity and ecosystem impacts of the   adult stage of S. woodiana among conservationists and natural resource   managers, potential effects of its larval stage have been neglected   until now. Because fish hosts are an obligatory part of the reproductive   cycle of the mussel and the main vector for spreading, documentation of   this direct and easily quantifiable impact on fish has great potential   to influence the key community of stakeholders in fisheries and   aquaculture sectors and to serve as a strong motivating factor for   invasive species control.

In   the event that biochar becomes widely applied to agricultural soils as a   soil conditioner, this research focuses on understanding how biochar   application to soil influences bacterial community structure and   biogeochemical function. A controlled pot experiment was designed to   investigate temporal changes in soil microbial ecology and   physicochemical parameters in the presence and absence of biochar.   Bacterial communities were investigated in both the rhizosphere and bulk   soil using TRFLP coupled with a 454 new generation sequencing database   to make tentative taxonomic assignments to TRFLP peaks that showed   statistically significant change over time. When comparing biochar   amended soils with controls, temporal changes in bacterial family   abundances that were >5\% included: Bradyrhizobiaceae (similar to 8\%),   Hyphomicrobiaceae (similar to 14\%), Streptosporangineae (similar to   6\%) and Thermomonosporaceae (similar to 8\%), where the biochar had a   positive influence - either promoting an increase in abundance or   reducing the magnitude of loss, and; Streptomycetaceae (similar to-11\%)   and Micromonosporaceae (similar to-7\%), where biochar was perceived to   have a negative effect on bacterial family abundance. The   Bradyrhizobiaceae and Hyphomicrobiaceae have significant involvement   nitrogen cycling, with genera/species identified by 454 involved in   nitrate (NO3-) denitrification through to N-2. The data also suggests   that organisms involved in nitrification of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrite   (NO2-) are less abundant while mycobacterial nitrate reduction to NH4+   increases along with N-2 fixation. Coupled to the observation that   biochar can adsorb NH4+, these results provide an explanation for the   reductions in N2O emissions observed from soils when biochar is added.   Results from this study also indicate that biochar promotes phosphate   solubilising bacteria, alters C-fluxes through increasing the abundance   of bacterial families that can degrade more recalcitrant C compounds,   and potentially decreases bacterial plant pathogens.

In addition,   parasites might affect food-web stability, interaction strength and   energy flow. Food-web structure also affects infectious disease dynamics   because parasites depend on the ecological networks in which they live.   Empirically, incorporating parasites into food webs is straightforward.   We may start with existing food webs and add parasites as nodes, or we   may try to build food webs around systems for which we already have a   good understanding of infectious processes. In the future, perhaps   researchers will add parasites while they construct food webs. Less   clear is how food-web theory can accommodate parasites.

For   instance, is representing parasites with complex life cycles as a single   node equivalent to representing other species with ontogenetic niche   shifts as a single node?

We combined these flammability metrics in a   Principal Components Analysis to evaluate potential shifts in litter   flammability from pre-SOD (with tanoak litter) to post-SOD (where tanoak   was replaced equally with remaining species). Litter flammability   changed following the loss of tanoak, but the differences were species-   and community-specific.

We develop a model of chinook salmon (   Oncorhynchus tschawytscha)-Renibacterium salmoninarum (Rs) dynamics   based on free-swimming Lake Michigan fish by synthesizing population and   epidemiological theory. Using the model, we expose critical   uncertainties about the system, identify opportunities for efficient and   insightful data collection, and pose testable hypotheses. Our simulation   results suggest that hatcheries potentially play an important role in   Lake Michigan Rs dynamics, and understanding vertical transmission will   be critical for quantifying this role. Our results also show that   disease-mediated responses to chinook salmon density need to be   considered when evaluating management actions. Related to this, a better   understanding of the stock-recruitment relationship and natural   mortality rates for wild-spawned fish and the impact of hatchery   stocking on recruitment is required. Finally, to further develop models   capable of assisting fishery management, fish health surveys ought to be   integrated with stock assessment. This is the first time a host-pathogen   modeling framework has been applied to managed, freshwater ecosystems,   and we suggest that such an approach should be used more frequently to   inform other emerging and chronic fish health issues.",1888,NO,RO,,,

The species differ in essential-oil content (from rich in   essential oil to non-producers) and composition, and also in life form   (from herbaceous species to tall shrubs). We compared the epiphytic   bacterial communities on the basis of (i) their abundance, (ii) their   metabolic profile (derived by use of the BIOLOG Ecoplate system) and   (iii) richness and diversity of substrates that they use, as a measure   of functional diversity. Among all species, the aromatic Melissa   officinalis was the most abundantly colonized. The bacterial communities   on the leaves of the aromatic Myrtus communis, Calamintha nepeta and   Melissa officinalis, and also of Cistus incanus catabolized all 31   substrates offered; those on the evergreen-sclerophyllous species,   Arbutus unedo and Quercus coccifera, catabolized only 14 and 17   substrates, respectively. Carbohydrates were consistently used   abundantly by all communities, whereas carboxylic acids were most   variably used. On average, the group of aromatic plants scored higher   regarding bacterial abundance, and richness and diversity of substrates   used by the bacterial communities on their leaves; the lowest values for   both substrate-use indices were recorded in A. unedo. Bacterial   abundance or richness or diversity of substrates used did not vary with   leaf oil content. Abundance was positively correlated with both   substrate-use indices. Results support claims that the antimicrobial   effects of essential oils are not exerted so much under natural   conditions as reports based on biassays with pathogens usually show.   Although essential oils play a part in the microbial colonization of the   phyllosphere, it is not likely that inhibition of phyllosphere bacteria   is essential oils' primary role, at least in the Mediterranean   environment.",1890,NO,RO,,,

Koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease, a lethal disease in carp and koi, has   spread rapidly since the late 1990s. Only a few studies have focused on   the ecology of KHV in natural freshwater environments, although   characterization and the diagnosis of KHV disease have been intensively   studied. This is mainly due to the lack of reliable detection methods   for KHV in natural environments.   2. Three different approaches have been used to detect KHV in fish   samples: (i) isolation and identification of the virus using cultured   cell lines; (ii) detection of viral DNA with target DNA amplification   techniques; and (iii) detection of anti-KHV antibodies using an   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among these methods, DNA   amplification techniques have become most popular because of their   sensitivity and simplicity.   3. In contrast to KHV detection in fish samples, detection of KHV from   water and sediment samples has not been reported. This is the result of   a lack of reliable KHV concentration methods for water and sediment   samples, although methodology from public health and marine microbiology   may be applicable to determine KHV concentration in such samples.   4. Few reports have evaluated the environmental factors (e.g.   temperature, UV irradiation) that affect the fate of KHV in water   bodies. Mass mortality of wild carp caused by KHV infection would result   in the removal of a large omnivorous fish from freshwater ecosystems and   may thus alter community structure and ecosystem functioning.",1891,NO,RO,,,

The processes and criteria used   by weed biological control researchers to assess the impact of potential   biological control agents on a plant species in its non-native range   provide a possible framework for assessing risks to indigenous plants.   While there are similarities between these criteria such as the need for   clear objectives, studies in the native range of the herbivore/pathogen,   good knowledge of the ecology of the target plant and taxonomy of the   plant and herbivore/pathogen, and modelling of the interaction between   the two organisms, there are some important differences in approach.   These include the need to consider the threat classification of the   plant, the likely greater risk from polyphagous herbivores/pathogens   than oligophagous or monophagous species, and the need to consider the   impact of an additional natural enemy in conjunction with a suite of   existing natural enemies. The costs of conducting a risk assessment of a   herbivore/pathogen in another country that damages plants indigenous to   another geographic area means that criteria will be needed for deciding   which foreign herbivore/pathogen species should be assessed. These   criteria could include the threat classification of the plant, the   amount of damage to the particular plant organs affected, and the   importance in key ecosystems.",1892,NO,RO,,,

We manipulated testosterone and nematode burdens in red   grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) in two populations to tease apart   their effects on carotenoid levels, ornament size and colouration in   three time-step periods. We found no evidence for interactive effects of   testosterone and parasites on ornament size and colouration. We showed   that ornament colouration was testosterone-driven. However, parasites   decreased comb size with a time delay and testosterone increased   carotenoid levels in one of the populations. This suggests that   environmental context plays a key role in determining how individuals   resolve the trade-off between allocating carotenoids for ornamental   coloration or for self-maintenance needs.

Synthetic GW, enriched with wastes from a dining hall, was added to   experimental RVFB systems. The greywater was recirculated for 2-3 days   at which time half of the water was removed from each system and   replaced with fresh synthetic GW Removal of chemical and microbiological   contaminants was determined by comparing influent to effluent samples   obtained after 8 and 72 h treatment in the systems.   GW treatment using the RVFB system reduced effluent concentrations for   NO3-N, total ammonia nitrogen, NO2-N, total suspended solids, boron, and   anionic surfactants to below the levels considered acceptable for either   recreation or irrigation. Reduction in chemical contaminants was   associated with a significant increase in the number of both   heterotrophic bacteria and surfactant- degrading bacteria within the   RVFB.   Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were   present at the beginning of each treatment cycle. Treatment using the   RVFB system resulted in final E. coli concentrations that met the USEPA   water quality criteria for recreational water.

Selection during interepidemic stages is crucial for the evolution of   pathogen populations. Trade-offs involving aggressiveness (quantitative   pathogenicity) have rarely been explored in pathogens with a life cycle   requiring the disease-causing organism to change organs within the same   host.   2. We investigated the existence of a trade-off between aggressiveness   and survival in Phytophthora infestans, the pathogen causing potato late   blight. In France, P. infestans behaves as an obligate biotroph,   surviving in infected tubers. Aggressive isolates, which are favoured   during the epidemic, may exhaust their nutrient supply too quickly to   bridge seasons, resulting in a possible trade-off between the two life   stages.   3. We inoculated tubers with isolates possessing different   aggressiveness levels, let them overwinter as outdoor piles at three   different sites, and scored the proportion of live tubers the following   spring.   4. At two sites, infection caused early tuber sprouting, which can be   seen either as a manipulation of the host by the pathogen, or as an   attempt by the host to escape.   5. Overwinter survival was higher for control than for inoculated   tubers, but did not differ between tubers inoculated with different   isolates. This suggests that aggressiveness should gradually increase in   P. infestans populations, unless a trade-off occurs at another stage of   the life cycle.",1895,NO,RO,,,

The last   comprehensive analysis of threats facing rare plants in the United   States was conducted nearly 20 years ago. Here we systematically analyze   the threats facing 2733 rare and vulnerable plants in the US using   textual analysis of the most comprehensive database available. In the   continental US plants are most commonly threatened by outdoor recreation   (affecting 35\% of species), especially from off-road vehicles (19\%)   and hiking and related activities (13\%). The next-most common threats   are from livestock (33\%), residential development (28\%), non-native   invasives (27\%), and roads (21\%). In Hawaii invasives threaten 95\% of   species followed by increases in fire intensity/frequency (26\%) then   livestock (19\%). Multivariate analyses indicate threats do not form   distinct ``syndromes'' (clusters of threats) but rather a single   ``mega-syndrome'' with high degrees of overlap between most threats.   We also compared the prevalence of threats to the distribution of   research effort. Nearly 75\% of threats are understudied relative to   their prevalence, including five of the six most common threats while a   few rare threats (missing species like pollinators; pathogens; logging;   climate-induced ecosystem movement; and crop-based agriculture) receive   most of the attention. In comparison to a benchmark assessment from 1998   (Wilcove et al. BioScience 48:607-615) we find little difference in   threat prevalence, though temporal trends suggest increasing frequency   of nearly all threats. Overall rare plants in the US are affected by a   dense network of threats across which research attention is   disproportionately directed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Agricultural land use threatens ecosystem services such as biological   control by natural enemies because of simplification of habitat   structure and intensification of disturbance and agrochemical inputs.   Low parasitism rates of agricultural pests have typically been   attributed to a lack of resources for parasitoids in highly simplified   landscapes, but this could be confounded by the nearly ubiquitous   correlation between landscape complexity and the cover of intensively   farmed agricultural crops. 2. Here, we disentangle the mechanisms   driving landscape-scale effects on hostparasitoid interactions by taking   advantage of a landscape modification gradient in which the diversity of   habitat types and annual crop cover in the landscape were uncorrelated.   We quantified herbivore densities and parasitism and hyperparasitism   rates on two important crop pests (aphids and Plutella xylostella)   across 30 landscapes. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to   test whether land-use intensity (insecticide application and habitat   disturbance) or resource availability for parasitoids (floral resources   and alternative host plants) was mediating the effects of habitat   diversity and annual crop cover on the landscape. 3. Rates of primary-   and hyperparasitism of aphids and primary parasitism of P. xylostella   decreased with increasing annual crop cover, whereas decreasing habitat   diversity in the landscape had little effect on parasitism rates. These   effects were mediated almost entirely by greater habitat disturbance and   greater frequency of insecticide application, rather than by changes in   resource availability. 4. Parasitoids were more sensitive to intensive   farming practices than were their herbivore hosts, and in turn   hyperparasitoids were more sensitive than were primary parasitoids. This   supports the theoretical prediction that higher trophic levels should be   increasingly sensitive to the disturbances associated with land-use   change. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our work suggests that increased   land-use intensity (e.g. higher insecticide inputs and greater levels of   disturbance associated with increasing area of annual crops) has been   underestimated as a driver of landscape effects on hostparasitoid   interactions. These findings have important implications for the   maintenance of ecosystem services such as biological control. The   promotion of low-intensity farming practices that limit the extent and   frequency of agrochemical inputs and habitat disturbances will be   essential for the maintenance of effective biological control by   parasitoids in agroecosystems.",1897,NO,RO,,,

Perturbations to an ecosystem's steady state can trigger transient   responses of great ecological relevance. Asymptotic stability determines   whether a generic perturbation will fade out in the long run, but falls   short of characterizing the dynamics immediately after an equilibrium   has been perturbed. Reactivity, traditionally defined as the maximum   instantaneous growth rate of small perturbations to a stable steady   state, is a simple yet powerful measure of the short-term instability of   a system as a whole. In many ecological applications, however, it could   be important to focus on the reactivity properties of just some   specific, problem-dependent state variables, such as the abundance of a   focal species engaged in interspecific competition, either predators or   preys in a trophic community, or infectious individuals in disease   transmission.   2. We propose a generalized definition of reactivity (g-reactivity) that   allows to evaluate the differential contribution of the state space   components to the transient behaviour of an ecological system following   a perturbation. Our definition is based on the dynamic analysis of a   system output, corresponding to an ecologically motivated linear   transformation of the relevant state variables. We demonstrate that the   g-reactivity properties of an equilibrium are determined by the dominant   eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix that can be easily obtained from the   Jacobian associated with the equilibrium and the system output   transformation.   3. As a testbed for our methodological framework, we analyse the   g-reactivity properties of simple spatially implicit metapopulation   models of some prototypical ecological interactions, namely competition,   predation and transmission of an infectious disease. We identify   conditions for the temporary coexistence of an invader with a (possibly   competitively superior) resident species, for transitory invasion of   either prey or predator in otherwise predator- or prey-dominated   ecosystems, and for transient epidemic outbreaks.   4. Through suitable examples, we show that characterizing the transient   dynamics associated with an ecosystem's steady state can be, in some   cases, as important as determining its asymptotic behaviour, from both   theoretical and management perspective. Because g-reactivity analysis   can be performed for systems of any complexity in a relatively   straightforward way, we conclude that it may represent a useful addition   to the toolbox of quantitative ecologists.",1898,NO,RO,,,

Moreover, understanding the dynamics of farmland seed   food resources for species of conservation concern is of considerable   research interest.   We examined the distribution of berries and soil-surface seeds in the   managed and unmanaged habitats of a 125 ha organic farm. We took soil   suction-samples over a year, counted and identified all seeds, and   compared abundances and species-richness between habitats. We   constructed ecological networks from literature records and by rearing   insects to investigate the importance of these seeds for insects, birds   and mammals. We predicted the impacts of management on seed biomass,   energy and the ecosystem service of pest control across the whole farm.   We estimated seed and berry food resources of up to 33 metric tons of   biomass and 560 GJ of energy on the farm. Potentially, more than 330   species use the seeds as a food resource, the overwhelming majority of   which are invertebrates (82\%) relying predominantly on non-crop and   weed species. Generally, uncultivated semi-natural habitats such as   woodland and mature hedgerows were more species-rich and had higher seed   biomass and energy than crop habitats throughout the year, but fallow   land was disproportionately important for seeds during the summer.   Models of increased management intensity revealed declines of up to 19\%   in seed biomass and energy and cascades through the network that   resulted in a substantial decrease in potentially pest-controlling   parasitoids.
