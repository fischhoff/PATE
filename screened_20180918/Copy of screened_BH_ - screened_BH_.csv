These microorganisms have developed an array of adaptations to hot, arid   climates with intense UV radiation, extreme diurnal temperature   fluctuations, and high soil salinity. Crust microorganisms positively   contribute to their harsh ecosystems, by preventing evapotranspiration,   fixing nitrogen, and blocking solar radiation. In doing so, desert crust   prevents soil erosion and facilitates the establishment of plant   species. However, like aquatic cyanobacteria, desert cyanobacteria have   the potential to produce toxins linked to human and animal illness.   Furthermore, the impact of terrestrial cyanobacterial toxins on human   health in desert regions is poorly understood. A largely ignored, but   potentially important human exposure route for cyanotoxins in desert   environments is through the inhalation of desert crusts during dust   storms and anthropogenic activity. Future work in this field should   include the characterization of toxins produced in desert regions as   well as the presence of toxins in clinical and environmental materials.

Green, Adolfo De Sostoa",2014,Scaled body-mass index shows how habitat quality influences the   condition of four fish taxa in north-eastern Spain and provides a novel   indicator of ecosystem health,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,1145-1160,1145-1160,10.1111/fwb.12336,"Natural and anthropogenic disturbances are key forces governing the   structure and functioning of aquatic communities. Understanding how   these factors shape organism performance can help to identify the most   vulnerable species and develop effective management strategies. This is   particularly important for ichthyofaunas with high endemicity and low   diversity, such as those of the Iberian Peninsula.   We explored the suitability of a novel and simple condition index, the   scaled mass index (SMI), based on mass-length relationships, for   analysis of the effects that abiotic and biotic pressures have on the   body condition of four fish taxa widely distributed in Mediterranean   rivers in north-eastern Spain: brown trout (Salmo trutta), Iberian   redfin barbel (Barbus haasi), Ebro barbel (Luciobarbus graellsii) and   minnows (Phoxinus spp.). The SMI performed better in explaining spatial   variation in body condition than the Fulton Index, a traditional method   for fish studies.   For all taxa, anthropogenic stressors influencing water quality and   physical habitat explained more variance in SMI than other factors.   Variation partitioning and GLM approaches consistently showed that SMI   increased with altitude, reduced concentrations of toxic nitrogenous   compounds, and well-preserved riparian canopy and natural channel   morphology, despite the fact that three of the study taxa are in   expansion and generally considered `tolerant'. In addition, the   application of SMI to an independent fish data set showed that SMI   provides a novel indicator of ecosystem health, which performs better   than the current index of biotic integrity developed in this region.   We discuss the likely mechanisms behind the strong effects of habitat   quality on SMI and the implications for our understanding of tolerance.   Incorporating SMI into studies of fish monitoring is likely to improve   the value of fish studies as indicators of river quality and ecological   change. Further studies should compare the response of SMI to specific   fish health indicators such as parasite load, haematological assays and   pollutant bioaccumulation to improve our understanding of the value of   SMI as a non-lethal diagnostic procedure.",816,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

The abiotic environment is a crucial component in   host-pathogen interactions in natural plant populations as favorable   conditions drive pathogen development, reproduction, and persistence.   Foliar plant pathogens, such as fungal lesions referred to generically   as ``leaf spot disease,'' are particularly responsive to increased   moisture levels, but the manner in which the abiotic environment drives   disease dynamics, and how these diseases regulate natural plant   populations, is not fully understood. We investigate (1) the impact of   ambient soil moisture and diffuse light on the prevalence of a leaf spot   pathogen (Phyllosticta sp.) in a natural population of Polygonatum   biflorum, an understory herb native to deciduous forest understories in   the eastern US, and (2) the effects of the fungal pathogen on the   survival, growth, and abundance of the plants. We tracked six P.   biflorum populations and disease incidence, as well as soil moisture and   diffuse light, between 2003 and 2005 in the understory deciduous forest   of the southern Appalachian Mountains, North Carolina, USA. Results show   that both the occurrence of P. biflorum and the prevalence of P.   biflorum leaf spot disease are highest where soil moisture is   intermediate and diffuse light is lowest. Disease occurrence depends   upon plant presence, but it also adversely impacts plant survival,   abundance, and growth. These results suggest that leaf spot disease is   likely to impact population dynamics, which in turn vary as a function   of environmental drivers.",817,MAYBE,MAYBE,BH,done,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,growth = change in leaf number. does not count as standing stock

The influence of a fungal endophyte alkaloid on the toxicity of a plant   has been documented in Oxytropis sericea. Oxytropis sericea is a   perennial legume responsible for livestock poisoning in western North   America. Livestock poisoning is attributed to the alkaloid swainsonine,   which is synthesized inside the plant by the fungal endophyte Embellisia   sp. In this study, the ability of Oxytropis sericea to form a   dinitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Rhizobium and the effects of this   symbiosis on the production of swainsonine by Embellisia sp. were   evaluated in a greenhouse environment. Seeds of O. sericea were grown in   plastic containers. Twenty-week-old O. sericea seedlings were inoculated   with four strains of Rhizobium. Twenty weeks after inoculation, plant   growth and root nodulation by Rhizobium were measured. Dinitrogen   fixation was confirmed using an acetylene reduction assay (ARA) on   excised root nodules. Dry leaves were analyzed for swainsonine content.   A second set of plants was treated with fungicide to evaluate the effect   of reduced fungal endophyte infection on plant growth and swainsonine   production. All inoculated plants produced indeterminate nodules. The   ARA indicated that 98\% of the excised nodules were fixing dinitrogen.   Rhizobium-treated plants had greater swainsonine concentrations than the   non-inoculated controls. Plants that established from seeds treated with   fungicide had lower biomass than non-fungicide-treated controls and   plants treated with foliar fungicide. Plants treated with foliar   fungicide and the controls had greater swainsonine concentrations than   the plants that received seed fungicide. This greenhouse study is the   first report of nodulation and dinitrogen fixation in O. sericea. It   also demonstrates that dinitrogen fixation increases the production of   swainsonine in O. sericea plants infected with Embellisia sp. Results   from this study suggest that dinitrogen fixation affects swainsonine   production and has the potential to support the symbiosis between   Embellisia sp. and O. sericea when soil nitrogen is limited. Oxytropis   sericea competitiveness appears to be facilitated by an ability to   simultaneously associate with Rhizohium and a fungal symbiont.",818,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Sixteen of the fungal isolates exhibited antibacterial activity against   at least one pathogen. All the strains showed antibacterial activity   against Vagococcus salmoninarum. Three isolates showed strong inhibition   against all test pathogens and they may therefore be remarkable as a   broad-spectrum antimicrobial. Nine isolates showed antibacterial   activity against Lactococcus garvieae, six were against Vibrio   anguillarum, and four isolates inhibited the growth of Yersinia ruckeri.   Co-culture of the fungus with the mix of the pathogen bacteria led to   the induction of bioactivity in two isolates. Aspergillus iizukae   produced strong and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against   pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.8-406 mu gmL(-1).   The screening results confirmed the sponge associated fungi as a source   of environmentally friendly antimicrobials that may contribute the   sustainable development of aquaculture. In addition, co-culture   technique is a promising strategy to increase antimicrobial activity   that can stimulate the production of novel compounds, and increases the   antimicrobial activities of marine derived fungi.",819,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Plant effects on soil biota can result in feedbacks affecting plant   performance, with consequences for plant community and ecosystem   dynamics on short and long time-scales. In addition, the strength and   direction of plant-soil feedbacks depend on temporal shifts in abiotic   environmental conditions.   2. We synthesize current knowledge on temporal aspects of plant-soil   feedbacks and present new ideas to better understand and predict the   effects of plant-soil feedbacks on community and ecosystem properties   across temporal scales.   3. Explaining short-term temporal feedback dynamics requires us to   better understand mechanistic linkages between plants, soil organisms   and locally available resources. On the other hand, we need to refine   our understanding of the context-dependency of plant-soil feedbacks, as   the strength and direction of feedback interactions are influenced by   `external' temporal ecosystem dynamics, such as variation in soil   resource availability after disturbance or during succession.   4. Synthesis. Based on our synthesis of temporal aspects of plant-soil   feedbacks, we suggest three main avenues for future research: (i) how   plant-soil feedbacks changes with ontogeny, (ii) how plant and soil   organism traits drive temporal variation in plant-soil feedbacks and   (iii) how environmental changes across temporal scales alter the   strength and direction of plant-soil feedbacks.",820,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

This work shows that the community of endophytic   siderophore-producing bacteria (SPB) associated to Oryza sativa   cultivated in Uruguayan soils is dynamic and diverse. These bacteria   were present in grains, roots, and leaves, and their density fluctuated   between log(10) 3.44 and log(10) 5.52 cfu g(-1) fresh weight (fw) during   the plant growth. Less than 10\% of the heterotrophic bacteria produced   siderophores in roots and leaves of young plants, but most of the   heterotrophic bacteria were siderophore-producers in mature plants.   According to their amplified restriction DNA ribosomal analysis (ARDRA)   pattern, 54 of the 109 endophytic SPB isolated from different plant   tissues or growth stages from replicate plots, were unique. Bacteria   belonging to the genera Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and   Enterobacter alternated during plant growth, but the genus Pantoea was   predominant in roots at tillering and in leaves at subsequent stages.   Pantoea ananatis was the SPB permanently associated to any of the plant   tissues, but the genetic diversity within this species-revealed by   BOX-PCR fingerprinting- showed that different strains were randomly   distributed along time and plant tissue, suggesting that a common trait   of the species P. ananatis determined the interaction with the rice   plant. Several isolates were stronger IAA producers than Azospirillum   brasilense or Herbaspirillum seropedicae. In vitro inhibition assays   showed that SPB of the genus Burkholderia were good antagonists of   pathogenic fungi and that only one SPB isolate of the genus Pseudomonas   was able to inhibit A. brasilense and H. seropedicae. These results   denoted that SPB were selected into the rice plant. P. ananatis was the   permanent and dominant associated species which was unable to inhibit   two of the relevant plant growth-promoting bacteria.",821,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Flexibility in cooperative resource use may be an important   response to resource decline, mediating the impacts of resource   availability on fitness and demography. In forest ecosystems, hollow   trees are key den resources for many species, but are declining   worldwide owing to forestry. Altered patterns of den sharing may mediate   the effects of the decline of this resource. We studied den-sharing   interactions among hollow-dependent Australian mountain brushtail   possums to investigate how spatial variation in hollow tree availability   affects resource sharing and kin selection. Under reduced den   availability, individuals used fewer dens and shared them less often.   This suggests increased territoriality in the presence of resource   competition. Further, there was a switch from kin avoidance to kin   preference with decreasing hollow tree availability. This was driven   primarily by a change in den sharing among siblings. The inclusive   fitness benefits of den sharing with kin are likely to increase under   resource-limiting conditions, but are potentially outweighed by the   benefits of associating with non-relatives (avoidance of inbreeding or   pathogen transmission) where dens are abundant.

It is   based on introduction of specialised natural enemies (herbivorous   insects and fungal pathogens) from the weed's native range. It can be   used safely if specialised natural enemies are selected and can be   highly effective in suppressing weeds over large areas. Agents used in   modern projects typically have genus or species level specificity and   are safe when proper risk analysis and procedures are followed. Agents   spread over large areas and can move into hard-to-reach areas. If   correctly selected, agents are safe for use in areas too ecologically   sensitive for chemical or mechanical control. Costs are independent of   area to be treated because agents are self-reproducing, and results are   self-sustaining. Biological control is most appropriate for use against   widespread weeds, difficult to control with other methods that occur in   critical habitats and damage biodiversity or ecosystem function. Finding   suitable agents is easier against weeds distantly related to local   native plants. Such targets reduce risk to native flora, facilitate   agent screening, lower cost, and increase likelihood of success.   Projects should be partnerships between biological control scientists   and conservation biologists, and biological control activities should be   done within a comprehensive restoration plan for the ecosystem. In some   cases, suppression of the invasive weed may be sufficient, but sometimes   additional actions, such as replanting native species or modifying   ecosystem processes such as fire or flooding regimes may be essential.",823,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Their life history traits as well as   (palaeo-) environmental conditions, including temperature, food   availability, salinity and pollution, can be traced through the analysis   of their shell (micro-) structure and biogeochemical composition. Adding   to this list, the DNA entrapped in shell carbonate biominerals   potentially offers a novel and complementary proxy both for   reconstructing palaeoenvironments and tracking mollusc evolutionary   trajectories. Here, we assess this potential by applying DNA extraction,   high-throughput shotgun DNA sequencing and metagenomic analyses to   marine mollusc shells spanning the last similar to 7,000 years. We   report successful DNA extraction from shells, including a variety of   ancient specimens, and find that DNA recovery is highly dependent on   their biomineral structure, carbonate layer preservation and disease   state. We demonstrate positive taxonomic identification of mollusc   species using a combination of mitochondrial DNA genomes, barcodes,   genome-scale data and metagenomic approaches. We also find shell   biominerals to contain a diversity of microbial DNA from the marine   environment. Finally, we reconstruct genomic sequences of organisms   closely related to the Vibrio tapetis bacteria from Manila clam shells   previously diagnosed with Brown Ring Disease. Our results reveal marine   mollusc shells as novel genetic archives of the past, which opens new   perspectives in ancient DNA research, with the potential to reconstruct   the evolutionary history of molluscs, microbial communities and   pathogens in the face of environmental changes.

Recent studies at the DYFAMED time-series station in the NW   Mediterranean Sea have shown that dominance of prokaryotes (Bacteria and   Archaea) within the microbial community represented by biomass data   increases with depth. The studies have also shown that the   depth-integrated biomass of protists (heterotrophic flagellates and   ciliates) in the mesopelagic layer is as great as that in the epipelagic   layer, and that biomass of mesopelagic prokaryotes is controlled by both   substrate availability (bottom-up control) and predation and viral   infection (top-down control). Data on prokaryotic growth efficiency   (derived from the prokaryotic heterotrophic production and the loss of   organic carbon flux in the mesopelagic layer on an annual scale) suggest   that mesopelagic prokaryotes are not simply remineralizers of organic   carbon, but also play an important role in supporting the production of   organisms belonging to higher trophic levels. Analysis using a simple   food chain model suggests that heterotrophic nanoflagellates may be   important remineralizers of organic carbon produced by prokaryotes, and   that the viral loop may enhance remineralization of organic carbon in   the mesopelagic layer. There are, however, uncertain elements in   measuring organic carbon flux and biomass and activity of the microbial   components in the mesopelagic layer.

However, few studies have examined the potential   importance of the direct foliar uptake of gaseous reactive N on foliar   delta N-15. Using an experimental set-up in which the rate of   mycorrhizal infection was reduced using a fungicide, we examined the   influence of mycorrhizae on foliar delta N-15 in potted red maple (Acer   rubrum) seedlings along a regional N deposition gradient in New York   State. Mycorrhizal associations altered foliar delta N-15 values in red   maple seedlings from 0.06 to 0.74 aEuro degrees across sites. At the   same sites, we explored the predictive roles of direct foliar N uptake,   soil delta N-15, and mycorrhizae on foliar delta N-15 in adult stands of   A. rubrum, American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black birch (Betula   lenta), and red oak (Quercus rubra). Multiple regression analysis   indicated that ambient atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration   explained 0, 69, 23, and 45 \% of the variation in foliar delta N-15 in   American beech, red maple, red oak, and black birch, respectively, after   accounting for the influence of soil delta N-15. There was no   correlation between foliar delta C-13 and foliar \%N with increasing   atmospheric NO2 concentration in most species.

Ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) is a potent   elicitor of a variety of changes in the chemistry, morphology and   physiology of plants and animals. Recent studies have demonstrated that   common signals, such as jasmonic acid (JA), play important roles in the   mechanisms by which plants respond to UV-B and to damage by herbivores.   Plant responses elicited by UV-B radiation can affect the choices of   ovipositing female insects and the fitness of their offspring. This   leads to the prediction that, in plants, the changes induced as a   consequence of UV damage will be similar to those elicited in response   to insect damage, including knock-on effects upon the next trophic   level, predators. In our trials female P. xylostella oviposited   preferentially on host plants grown in depleted UV-B conditions, while   their larvae preferred to feed on tissues from UV-depleted regimes over   those from UV-supplemented ones. Larval feeding patterns on   UV-supplemented tissues met the predictions of models which propose that   induced defences in plants should disperse herbivory; feeding scars were   significantly smaller and more numerous - though not significantly so -   than those on host plant leaves grown in UV-depleted conditions. Most   importantly, female parasitoids also showed a clear pattern of   preference when given the choice between host plants and attendant   larvae from the different UV regimes; however, in the case of the female   parasitoids, the choice was in favour of potential hosts foraging on   UV-supplemented tissues.

A parallel research effort, the process   approach, has been directed at modeling tree injury and mortality by   directly simulating the energy-transfer process from the fire to the   exterior surface of the plant, and thence into roots, stems, and   foliage.

Our results suggest that host carrying   capacity is more likely than flea niche breadth to modulate the number   of links in hostparasite interaction networks. Main conclusions The   complex interplay between geographic variation in host diversity and   both host and parasite traits can lead to unexpected spatial patterns   such as the invalidation of expected parasites and links in hostparasite   web LDGs. Beyond our focus on hostparasite interactions, our study is   among the first in the emerging field of interaction network   macroecology and paves the way for other components of ecological   networks to be investigated across space and time.",831,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

A widely employed   management action to restore reef communities is the implementation of   marine protected areas (MPAs). We measured the effectiveness of the MPA   network in Belize in promoting increases in fish and coral populations   and identified key ecological and environmental factors that influence   reef community structure and potentially protection success. From 2009   to 2013, we annually surveyed 16 reefs in Belize, including 8 MPA sites   (where ex tractive fishing is limited or prohibited) and 8 unprotected   sites. At each site, we quantified the biomass of reef fishes, coral and   macroalgal cover, and several biotic and abiotic variables that are   known to affect reef inhabitants. High predatory reef fish and   parrotfish biomass values were associated with high reef structural   complexity and low wave exposure. Mean macroalgal cover was negatively   associated with parrotfish biomass in 1 protected zone. However, mean   macroalgal cover remained above 40\% across all sites, and no change in   coral cover was observed during the study. Our results indicate that   fisheries restrictions alone do not lead to increases in coral cover   even when successful for fishes. We speculate that both illegal and   legal fishing may be compromising Belize's MPA network goals.   Furthermore, we suggest that species composition as well as local   environmental conditions play key roles in coral reef recovery and   should be considered when evaluating management strategies.",832,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

We show how a   diverse natural enemy assemblage contributes substantially to the   collapse of the ant-scale mutualism following managed ant suppression.   Natural enemy abundance and species richness increased significantly   after ant suppression, with varying responses among the different   functional guilds. Primary parasitoids coexisted with tending ants   before ant suppression, but could not regulate the enormously high scale   densities alone. After ant suppression, a significant increase in   predators caused a collapse of the scale population. Guilds external to   the mutualism were also affected, with primary parasitoids of various   non-hemipteran taxa also increasing, which contributed significantly to   the recovery of the community to its pre-invasion composition. Our   results highlight the far-reaching and pervasive effects of the   hemipteran-tending invasive ant within the natural enemy assemblage.

Here, I compare development and reproductive   strategies in two species of solitary secondary hyperparasitoids,   Lysibia nana and Gelis agilis, attacking pre-pupae of their primary   parasitoid host, Cotesia glomerata. Parasitoid larvae of both species   exploit a given amount of host resources with similar efficiency.   However, adults exhibit quite different reproductive strategies. Both   species are synovigenic, and female wasps emerge with no mature eggs.   However, G. agilis must first host-feed to produce eggs, while L. nana   does not host-feed but mobilizes internal resources carried over from   larval feeding to initiate oogenesis. Further, G. agilis is wingless,   produces large eggs, has a long life-span, and generates only small   numbers of progeny per day, whereas these traits are reversed in L.   nana. Given unlimited hosts, the fecundity curve in L. nana was   ``front-loaded,'' whereas in G. agilis it was depressed and extended   over much of adult life. In L. nana (but not G. agilis), wasps provided   with honey but no hosts lived significantly longer than wasps provided   with both honey and hosts. Differences in the fecundity curves of the   two hyperparasitoids are probably based on differing costs of   reproduction between them, with the wingless G. agilis much more   constrained in finding hosts than the winged L. nana. Importantly, L.   nana is known to be a specialist hyperparasitoid of gregarious Cotesia   species that pupate in exposed locations on the food plant, whereas   Gelis sp. attack and develop in divergent hosts such as parasitoid   cocoons, moth pupae and spider egg sacs. Consequently, there is a strong   match between brood size in C. glomerata and egg production in L. nana,   but a mismatch between these parameters in G. agilis.",834,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

However,   knowledge on the physiological responses is poor. We measured   photosynthetic responses to increasing N deposition in two peatmoss   species (Sphagnum balticum and Sphagnum fuscum) from a 3-year,   north-south transplant experiment in northern Europe, covering a   latitudinal N deposition gradient ranging from 0.28 g N m(-2) year(-1)   in the north, to 1.49 g N m(-2) year(-1) in the south. The maximum   photosynthetic rate (NP(max)) increased southwards, and was mainly   explained by tissue N concentration, secondly by allocation of N to the   photosynthesis, and to a lesser degree by modified photosystem II   activity (variable fluorescence/maximum fluorescence yield). Although   climatic factors may have contributed, these results were most likely   attributable to an increase in N deposition southwards. For S. fuscum,   photosynthetic rate continued to increase up to a deposition level of   1.49 g N m(-2) year(-1), but for S. balticum it seemed to level out at   1.14 g N m(-2) year(-1). The results for S. balticum suggested that   transplants from different origin (with low or intermediate N   deposition) respond differently to high N deposition. This indicates   that Sphagnum species may be able to adapt or physiologically adjust to   high N deposition. Our results also suggest that S. balticum might be   more sensitive to N deposition than S. fuscum. Surprisingly, NP(max) was   not (S. balticum), or only weakly (S. fuscum) correlated with biomass   production, indicating that production is to a great extent is governed   by factors other than the photosynthetic capacity.",835,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Many studies have looked at GM plant effects on single non-target   herbivore species or on simple herbivore-natural enemy food chains.   Agro-ecosystems, however, are characterized by numerous insect species   which are involved in complex interactions, forming food webs. In this   study, we looked at transgenic disease-resistant wheat (Triticum   aestivum) and its effect on aphid-parasitoid food webs. We hypothesized   that the GM of the wheat lines directly or indirectly affect aphids and   that these effects cascade up to change the structure of the associated   food webs. Over 2 years, we studied different experimental wheat lines   under semi-field conditions. We constructed quantitative food webs to   compare their properties on GM lines with the properties on   corresponding non-transgenic controls. We found significant effects of   the different wheat lines on insect community structure up to the fourth   trophic level. However, the observed effects were inconsistent between   study years and the variation between wheat varieties was as big as   between GM plants and their controls.

Recruitment-restriction   hypotheses involving main factors in the seed bank dynamics were   analysed, and a diagrammatic dynamics model drafted from a population   perspective. Viable seed production averaged 362 per plant. Seed shadows   resulting from primary dispersal were concentrated under the mother   plant. There were two thyme-seed predators: coleopteran larvae   (pre-dispersal phase) and Messor bouvieri ants (pre- and post-dispersal   phases), which predated 16.4\% and 3.8\% of population yield,   respectively. However, ants may simultaneously contribute to the spatial   secondary dispersal, since they lost a small fraction of seeds they   harvested. Seeds showed innate physiological dormancy to high summer   temperatures, although this disappeared rapidly. The response of   germination to other temperature x light conditions was wide and rapid.   No permanent seed bank was detected in the soil. Seeds buried in the   upper soil layer (2 cm) germinated highly and fast. In contrast, a   significant fraction of seeds buried deeply (8 cm) remained viable for   over one year. Germination in the field accounted for only 1.0\% of the   seed output, and seed death due to pathogen attack and aging was also   low (3.0\%). Seedling emergence was confined to autumn and showed a high   correlation with total plant cover, irrespective of plant species.   Seedling survival was very low. The small spatial correspondence between   primary dispersal and seedling emergence patterns may reflect the   importance of secondary dispersal in T funkii seed bank dynamics.

Here, we   investigated the relative effects on the ecosystem service of   pollination of (i) land-use change brought on by agriculture and   urbanization as well as (ii) the prevalence of pollinator parasites,   using experimental insect pollinator-dependent plant species in natural   pollinator communities. We found that pollinator habitat (i.e.   availability of nesting resources for ground-nesting bees and local   flower richness) was strongly related to flower visitation rates at the   local scale and indirectly influenced plant pollination success. At the   landscape scale, pollination was positively related to urbanization,   both directly and indirectly via elevated visitation rates. Bumblebees   were the most abundant pollinator group visiting experimental flowers.   Prevalence of trypanosomatids, such as the common bumblebee parasite   Crithidia bombi, was higher in urban compared with agricultural areas, a   relationship which was mediated through higher Bombus abundance.

There is a need for further   understanding of how specific components of biodiversity are affecting   service provision. In this context, terrestrial plants are a   particularly important component of biodiversity and one for which a   wealth of information on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning   relationships is available. In this paper, we consider terrestrial   plants as providers of ecosystem services and analyze whether   manipulating plant diversity has an effect on the magnitude of ecosystem   service provision using a meta-analysis of 197 effect sizes and a   vote-counting analysis of 361 significance tests. The results of these   analyses are compared with those of a previous meta-analysis that   included a wide diversity of service providers. We produce a synthesis   table to explicitly link plants as service providers to indicators of   ecosystem properties and these to ecosystem services. By focusing on   only plants, we found a clear positive effect of biodiversity on six out   of eight services analyzed (provisioning of plant products, erosion   control, invasion resistance, pest regulation, pathogen regulation and   soil fertility regulation). When controlling for pseudoreplication   (repeated records from single studies), we found that four of the six   positive effects remained significant; only pest regulation and soil   fertility showed non-significant effects. Further expanding our basis   for inference with the vote-counting analysis corroborated these   results, demonstrating that quantitative meta-analysis and vote-counting   methods are both useful methods to synthesize biodiversity ecosystem   service studies. Notwithstanding the restricted number of identified   services, our results point to the importance of maintaining plant   diversity to ensure and increased provision of ecosystem services which   benefit human well-being.",840,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

We examined the   effects of three timber harvest options (single-tree selection, patch   cuts, no harvest) on the reproductive biology of a possible indicator of   bottomland forest ecosystem integrity, the prothonotary warbler   (Protonotaria citrea). Timber harvests reduced the number of available   nest cavities, reduced the density of breeding males on the plots, and   increased the sizes of male territories. However, timber harvest had no   obvious effect on nest predation or brood parasitism frequencies. Brood   parasitism was instead related to distance from a nearby levee, a main   source of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in the area.   Productivity remained similar within suitable habitat regardless of   treatment. Reproductive success was strongly influenced by annual   variation, which we attribute to the timing and extent of annual   flooding, a fundamental ecosystem process in floodplain forests.

While the shift from barrens to a   kelp bed requires a large perturbation, namely a disease outbreak   causing urchin mass mortality, the reverse shift is more gradual and   mediated by the formation and propagation of destructive grazing   aggregations (or fronts) of sea urchins Strongylocentrotus   droebachiensis. We have developed a spatial model for the   re-establishment of kelp beds and the formation of a feeding front of   urchins in order to describe transitions (phase shifts) between kelp bed   and barrens states following an urchin mass mortality event. Our model   includes size-specific movement, growth, and survival of urchins, as   well as growth of kelp and grazing by urchins. The position of the kelp   bed-barrens interface (or grazing front) predicted by our model is in   general agreement with field observations at 2 sites and for up to 7 yr   after a mass mortality event. Elasticity analysis showed that daily   foraging movements by individual urchins have the greatest effect on the   position of the feeding front and the density of the urchins there.   Survival and recruitment rates of urchins also have large effects on   urchin density at the front. The density of urchin populations in   deep-water thermal refuges (from a disease agent) and the distance   between these source populations and remnant or emergent kelp beds have   large effects on the time required for the re-formation of a feeding   front after an event of urchin mass mortality.

For the majority   of the real food webs considered here, secondary consumers were no more   likely to occupy an integer trophic position than in randomized food   webs. This means that, above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are   better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores.

A key rationale for pursuing de-extinction is the potential to   restore lost processes and function to modern ecosystems. However,   understanding and providing for the ecological requirements of the   candidate species will also play a key role in determining the ultimate   success of a de-extinction. This assessment is challenging for   prehistoric extinct species, where empirical studies or observations on   their ecology are not available or are incomplete.   2. A healthy, stable and self-sustaining population of a resurrected   species needs to be embedded in an ecological interaction network that   consists not only of interactions between a resurrected species and its   external environment (e.g. habitat, diet), but also those where the   resurrected species is the environment (e.g. microbiota and parasites).   Palaeoecology can provide information on all of these interactions for   extinct species, and this information can help guide and inform the   selection of suitable de-extinction candidates or traits for   resurrection.   3. Ecological interaction network analyses offer a complementary tool to   existing frameworks for determining the suitability of de-extinction   candidates, allowing palaeoecological information to be used to identify   and quantify the potential implications of removing or adding   resurrected species/functions to an ecosystem.   4. Although palaeoecological data and understanding clearly have an   important role in informing and modelling the potential ecological   functions provided by extinct species, they can only ever provide an   incomplete picture and therefore would only complement, rather than   replace, observational or experimental data on the resurrected organisms   themselves.",844,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

By separating the trap-nesting species into functional groups according   to their prey, we aimed to understand the underlying patterns for the   effects of plant diversity. Increasing plant species richness had a   significant effect only on spider-predating wasps, the group of wasps   trophically most distant from plants. In contrast, bees and food-web   structure were unaffected by plant diversity. Spider-predating wasp   abundance negatively correlated with the abundance of spiders,   suggesting top-down control. Interestingly, the abundance of spiders was   the only variable that was strongly affected by plant composition.

Our fawn study was justified by the   need to explain annual variation in female-to-fawn ratios apparent   during field surveys. Using vaginal implant transmitters in radio-marked   adult females to locate birth sites, we captured, weighed, and   radio-collared fawns on 4 privately owned ranches. We monitored collared   fawns daily and investigated mortalities within 24 hours of receiving a   mortality signal to determine cause of death. When possible, we   collected thymus glands to assess body condition. We captured 170 fawns   (64 white-tailed deer; 106 mule deer), of which 145 were of known-age   from collared females, and found that relatively heavy adult females   birthed relatively heavy fawns. We also noted that mass gain of fawns   and mass of fawns' thymus glands were very low compared to other studies   of fawns. We documented mortalities: 47 by predation, 47 by   sickness-starvation, 1 by conspecific trauma, and 3 undeterminable.   Bobcats (Lynx rufus) were responsible for nearly all fawn predation;   thymus gland and fawn mass data indicated that bobcats did not select   weaker fawns. We used proportional hazards regression to assess factors   influencing fawn survival and competing risks of mortality and made   comparisons between the species when possible. We censored 6 fawns from   our analyses and found that half of mortalities occurred within 15 days   postpartum, and 12 of the 139 known-age fawns (9\%) died within 25 m of   the birth site. Fawn survival was 78\% at 6 days old, which was the   median estimated age-at-capture of fawns from unknown adults. Annual   fawn survival rate ranged from 50\% for fawns born in 2004 to 17\% for   fawns born in 2006, with no overall effect of species. Fawn survival was   greatest in 2004 when rain during the May-August late-gestation and   lactation period was greatest. Mule deer fawns succumbed more to   sickness-starvation than did white-tailed deer fawns. Rates of   sickness-starvation and predation increased with deviance from mean   annual birth dates and with reduced rain during the late-gestation and   lactation period. Early fawn survival increased with relative fawn mass,   and sex became important at about 30 days postpartum, after which males   were at greater risk of sickness-starvation. Lunn-McNeil competing-risks   models suggested some interaction between sickness-starvation and   predation. Fawn mortality, mass gain, thymus mass, and weaning data   indicated that the populations of both deer species were chronically   stressed near a carrying capacity that fluctuated annually with rain and   that adult females invested little energy in rearing fawns relative to   captive females.

Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale   networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time   periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat   assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs   to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the   magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated   the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for   several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal   variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations   suggest that long-term monitoring programs (>= 20 years) can detect   population trends of 5\% per year or more with adequate statistical   power (>= 0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (<= 10 years) have   insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses   demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20 years with four   surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would   have the potential for detecting a 5\% annual change in abundance for a   suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of   reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species   abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the   most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low   variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population   monitoring.

The amino acid arginine is one of   the pH-elevating agents in the oral cavity. To obtain insights into the   effect of arginine on oral microbial ecology, a multi-plaque   ``artificial mouth'' (MAM) biofilm model was inoculated with saliva   from a healthy volunteer and microcosms were grown for 4 weeks with 1.6   \% (w/v) arginine supplement (Arginine) or without (Control), samples   were taken at several time-points. A cariogenic environment was mimicked   by sucrose pulsing. The bacterial composition was determined by 16S rRNA   gene amplicon sequencing, the presence and amount of Candida and   arginine deiminase system genes arcA and sagP by qPCR. Additionally,   ammonium and short-chain fatty acid concentrations were determined. The   Arginine microcosms were dominated by Streptococcus, Veillonella, and   Neisseria and remained stable in time, while the composition of the   Control microcosms diverged significantly in time, partially due to the   presence of Megasphaera. The percentage of Candida increased 100-fold in   the Control microcosms compared to the Arginine microcosms. The   pH-raising effect of arginine was confirmed by the pH and ammonium   results. The abundances of sagP and arcA were highest in the Arginine   microcosms, while the concentration of butyrate was higher in the   Control microcosms. We demonstrate that supplementation with arginine   serves a health-promoting function; it enhances microcosm resilience   toward acidification and suppresses outgrowth of the opportunistic   pathogen Candida.

In the past   century, the feeding strategy of one of the largest and best-known   terrestrial carnivores, Tyrannosaurus rex, has been the subject of much   debate: was it an active predator or an obligate scavenger? Here we look   at the feasibility of an adult T. rex being an obligate scavenger in the   environmental conditions of Late Cretaceous North America, given the   size distributions of sympatric herbivorous dinosaurs and likely   competition with more abundant small-bodied theropods. We predict that   nearly 50 per cent of herbivores would have been within a 55-85 kg   range, and calculate based on expected encounter rates that carcasses   from these individuals would have been quickly consumed by smaller   theropods. Larger carcasses would have been very rare and heavily   competed for, making them an unreliable food source. The potential   carcass search rates of smaller theropods are predicted to be 14-60   times that of an adult T. rex. Our results suggest that T. rex and other   extremely large carnivorous dinosaurs would have been unable to compete   as obligate scavengers and would have primarily hunted large vertebrate   prey, similar to many large mammalian carnivores in modern-day   ecosystems.",849,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Human activities have significantly   modified both the flux and the ratio of nutrients delivered to aquatic   ecosystems. Climate perturbations influence the hydrological regime and   enhance nutrient mineralization and transport from land to receiving   waters. Changes in land use and damming have resulted in changes in the   balance among nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon elements, thus increasing   the risk of algal bloom. Nutrient variation and its ecological effects   in the subtropical region could be more significant than in other areas   because of rapid development and high population. Aquatic ecosystems   respond to nutrient variation in complex and dynamic ways resulting in   eutrophication, hypoxia/anoxia, acidification, and changes in   phytoplankton and microbial communities. This review suggests that   harmful algal bloom, jellyfish bloom, and serious pathogens are often   associated with nutrient variations. The current challenges to   scientific research and management include the facts that (1) the link   between nutrient dynamics and ecosystem responses is poorly understood;   (2) monitoring data to support modeling and management are scarce; (3)   aquatic ecosystems are site-specific and/or situation-specific and are   highly dynamic, giving greater complexity in research and management;   and (4) the lack of regional coordination in traditional management   causes transboundary gaps. To address these current challenges, an   integrated management framework was proposed for effective nutrient   management. Institutional arrangements should be developed to coordinate   across multiple government agencies and other stakeholders from   watershed to coast. The framework should integrate an interdisciplinary   scientific approach and adaptive principles regarding nutrient   management.",851,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Here, we investigated how N-limiting growth   conditions, resulting in altered algal elemental stoichiometry and   physiology, affected virus proliferation in the phytoplankters   Micromonas pusilla and Phaeocystis globosa. Algal cultures were adapted   to balanced nutrient-limited growth, i.e. N-, P-and NPcontrolled growth,   before infection with their respective viruses MpV-08T and PgV-07T. The   viral infection experiments were then performed in batch cultures to   allow optimal 1-step virus growth cycles. Compared to the   nutrient-replete cultures, infection of nutrient-controlled hosts   resulted in elongated latent periods (time until first virus release)   and reduced viral burst sizes (viruses lysed host cell(-1)) for both MpV   and PgV. For MpV, the viral burst size was reduced by 70\%, independent   of the type of nutrient. The burst size of PgV was most reduced under   N-limitation, by as much as 92\%, compared to 70\% under P-limitation.   Overall, our results demonstrate that algal virus production can be   strongly impaired by N-limitation and that the effects are of a similar   magnitude to or even larger than for P.

One of the most profound changes to Earth's   ecosystems is the alteration of global nutrient cycles, including those   of phosphorus (P) and especially nitrogen (N). Along with the obvious   direct benefits of nutrient application for food production,   anthropogenic inputs of N and P can indirectly affect the abundance of   infectious, and noninfectious pathogens. The mechanisms underpinning   observed correlations, however, and how such patterns vary with disease   type, have long remained conjectural. Here, we highlight recent   experimental advances to critically evaluate the relationship between   environmental nutrient enrichment and disease. Given the interrelated   nature of human and wildlife disease emergence. we include a broad range   of human and wildlife examples from terrestrial, marine, and freshwater   ecosystems. We examine the consequences of nutrient pollution on   directly transmitted, vector-borne, complex life cycle, and   noninfectious pathogens, including West Nile virus, malaria, harmful   algal blooms, coral reef diseases, and amphibian malformations.   Our synthetic examination suggests that the effects of environmental   nutrient enrichment on disease are complex and multifaceted, varying   with the type of pathogen, host species and condition, attributes of the   ecosystem, and the degree of enrichment: some pathogens increase in   abundance whereas others decline or disappear. Nevertheless, available   evidence indicates that ecological changes associated with nutrient   enrichment often exacerbate infection and disease caused by generalist   parasites with direct or simple life cycles. Observed mechanisms include   changes in host/vector density, host distribution, infection resistance,   pathogen virulence or toxicity, and the direct supplementation of   pathogens. Collectively, these pathogens may be particularly dangerous   because they can continue to cause mortality even as their hosts   decline, potentially leading to sustained epidemics or chronic   pathology. We suggest that interactions between nutrient enrichment and   disease will become increasingly important in tropical and subtropical   regions, where forecasted increases in nutrient application will occur   in an environmental rich with infections pathogens.

The presence of Brucella abortus within free-ranging wildlife   populations is an important conservation and management issue because of   the risk of brucellosis transmission between wildlife and livestock.   Predicting wildlife distributions is necessary to forecast wildlife and   livestock spatial overlap and the potential for brucellosis   transmission.   2. We used Global Positioning System data collected from   telemetry-collared female elk Cervus elaphus to develop resource   selection function (RSF) models during the brucellosis transmission risk   period (the abortion and calving periods). We validated extrapolation of   predictive models at two nearby elk ranges within the Greater   Yellowstone Ecosystem. Additionally, we integrated extrapolated RSF maps   and domestic livestock distributions to estimate the relative   probability of elk and livestock commingling during the brucellosis   transmission risk period.   3. The top-ranked model predicted that areas selected by elk had a lower   probability of wolf Canis lupus occupancy, were privately owned and   south facing, and had steeper slopes, lower road densities and higher   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Elk selected forests and   shrublands over grasslands; however, the strength of selection decreased   as snowpack increased. Elk selection for privately owned lands may lead   to spatial overlap with livestock and increase the risk of elk and   livestock intermingling. Furthermore, if both elk and livestock   concentrate in areas of higher NDVI, increased spatial overlap may occur   in these areas.   4. Predictive accuracy was highest in the study area where the model was   developed. When compared to the model development area, predictive   accuracy of extrapolated RSF maps was similar or better in one of the   elk ranges and lower in the other elk range.   5. Synthesis and applications. Extrapolated RSF and spatial overlap maps   can provide a foundation for identifying the highest risk areas of elk   and livestock spatial overlap during the brucellosis transmission risk   period. However, the predictive accuracy of the models is limited when   applied to different areas. Site-specific models of spatial overlap   would therefore be needed to provide the most accurate estimates of elk   and livestock spatial overlap during the transmission risk period. The   degree to which spatial overlap may lead to actual transmission risk   needs to be investigated as this is not yet known and could have   important implications for managing transmission risk.",856,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

In a 12-month field experiment, we investigated the effect   of domatia on mite density, the role of these mites in limiting leaf   fungi, and the associated effects on plant fitness in the endemic New   Zealand shrub, Coprosma lucida. The presence of domatia on mite density   was controlled using combinations of domatia blocking, sham blocking,   mite addition and mite control using miticide. Limiting access to   domatia reduced mite density and increased the proportion of leaves   without mites. Mite families represented were predominantly   fungivorous/detritivorous (97.2\%), and predaceous (2.6\%); herbivorous   mites were absent. Mites significantly reduced fungal hyphae, fungal   spores and pollen, but the effect was surface-(upper/lower) and   density-dependent with the greatest reduction in fungi occurring over   low mite densities. Fungal hyphae reduced leaf longevity, but were   associated with increased production of new leaves. Hyphae density on   old leaves was negatively correlated with the number of domatia produced   on new leaves. New leaves in the mite reduction treatment had slightly   reduced levels of carbon but not nitrogen. High levels of fungal   infection on the lower surface increased the number of fruit fascicles   per shoot, however on the upper surface where fungi were reduced by   mites, hyphae density was negatively related to reproduction. The data   support a limited interpretation of a fitness benefit for plants with   domatia. While domatia increased mite density, control of fungi by mites   occurred at lower average densities than supported by plants without   functioning domatia. We suggest the primary function of leaf domatia in   this mutualism is to increase the probability of a leaf-level beneficial   mite presence rather than to maximise mite density.

Previous studies suggest that the causative agent   of disease, the pathogenic amoeba Paramoeba invadens, cannot withstand   winter sea temperatures on this coast, and may be an alien species.   Consequently, recurrent epizootics result from repeated introductions of   this pathogen, possibly due to advection or vertical mixing associated   with storm events. Here we test an alternative hypothesis that P.   invadens has established resident populations, either through   physiological adaptation to low winter temperatures, or because winter   minima have increased since 1980. To test this hypothesis, we   manipulated culture temperatures of P. invadens isolated from moribund   sea urchins during a disease outbreak in 2012. Specific growth rates of   P. invadens in culture at 0.5 to 18.0 degrees C were similar to those   observed in the early 1980s, providing no evidence of physiological   adaptation. P. invadens declined to extinction in culture after similar   to 1 month at 0.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C, but survived for 3 months   at 3.5 degrees C, as indicated by recovery of cultures following   transfer to optimal temperature. These results indicate a lower   temperature tolerance threshold around 2-3 degrees C, which is   consistent with observational data of recurrent mass mortalities of sea   urchins in 1983 and 2012 in the absence of a storm but following   relatively warm winters. A trend of increasing minimum temperatures in   winter indicates that P. invadens could undergo a range expansion to   establish a resident population in Nova Scotia within 1-2 decades. This   is expected to increase the resilience of the kelp-bed state of the   benthic ecosystem but result in the complete collapse of the sea urchin   fishery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We   hypothesized that shade-tolerant species allocate more carbon to defense   and storage and less to growth compared to shade-intolerant species. In   gaps and forest understory, we measured relative growth rates (RGR),   carbon-based defensive compounds (condensed tannin, total phenolics),   and storage compounds (total non-structural carbohydrate; TNC) in   seedlings of two tree species differing in shade tolerance. RGR was   greater in the shade-intolerant species, Castanea crenata, than in the   shade-tolerant species, Quercus mongolica var. grosseserrata, in gaps,   but did not differ between the species in the forest understory. In   contrast, concentrations of condensed tannin and total phenolics were   greater in Quercus than in Castanea at both sites. TNC pool sizes did   not differ between the species. Condensed tannin concentrations   increased with increasing growth rate of structural biomass (GRstr) in   Quercus but not in Castanea. TNC pool sizes increased with increasing   GRstr in both species, but the rate of increase did not differ between   the species. Accordingly, the amount of condensed tannin against TNC   pool sizes was usually higher in Quercus than in Castanea. Hence,   Quercus preferentially invested more carbon in defense than in storage.   Such a large allocation of carbon to defense would be advantageous for a   shade-tolerant species, allowing Quercus to persist in the forest   understory where damage from herbivores and pathogens is costly. In   contrast, the shade-intolerant Castanea preferentially invested more   carbon in growth rather than defense (and similar amounts in storage as   Quercus), ensuring establishment success in gaps, where severe   competition occurs for light among neighboring plants.

Our data reveal viral communities in human saliva dominated by   bacteriophages whose constituents are temporally distinct. The   preponderance of shared homologs between the salivary viral communities   in two unrelated subjects in the same household suggests that   environmental factors are determinants of community membership. When   comparing salivary viromes to those from human stool and the respiratory   tract, each group was distinct, further indicating that habitat is of   substantial importance in shaping human viromes.

Adding artificial nesting sites, such as   trap nests, can promote cavity-nesting bees in agroecosystems, but   effectiveness could be limited by the availability of floral resources   in the surrounding landscape and by natural antagonists.   2. In two European regions, we exposed artificial trap nests in paired   field boundaries adjacent to oilseed rape (OSR) fields or non-flowering   crops for 2years within 32 landscapes covering two independent gradients   of OSR cover and semi-natural habitat (SNH) cover in the landscape. We   analysed the effects of local and landscape-wide floral resource   availability, land-use intensity, landscape complexity and natural   antagonists on community composition and population dynamics of   trap-nesting bees.   3. Numbers of brood cells showed a strong, three-fold increase in   response to the additional nesting sites. Species richness and abundance   of cavity-nesting bees that were active during OSR flowering increased   significantly with increasing amounts of early season landscape-wide   floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of OSR. Later   foraging species benefited instead from the availability of late-season   alternative flower resources or SNH cover once the mass-flowering had   ceased. Density-dependent parasitism increased following mass-flowering,   while no density-dependent effect was found during mass-flowering.   4. Structural equation modelling revealed that the influence of floral   resource availability on community growth rate was mediated by community   size. Community size showed a strong negative effect on community growth   rate. Despite positive density-dependent parasitism, antagonists had   only weak regulating effects on community growth rate.   5. Synthesis and applications. Trap-nesting bee populations grow   markedly with the increasing availability of food resources in the   landscape and effectiveness of trap nests is only marginally limited by   natural antagonists. Thus, trap nests could be a simple   pollinator-supporting strategy to accompany the current expansion of   mass-flowering crops and to ensure pollination services for   insect-pollinated crops. Trap nests benefit, not only early season   active generalist bees during oilseed rape flowering, but also species   with later phenology if accompanied by other pollinator-supporting   practices.",862,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

The bacterial abundance was tide driven and high at the mouth of the   estuary, whereas periphyton biomass, in terms of chlorophyll a was   higher in the freshwater to brackish zone.

The ecological impact of viruses on   microbial food webs, however, may be influenced by evolutionary   processes, including the ability of bacteria to evolve resistance to   viruses and the theoretical prediction that this resistance should be   accompanied by a fitness cost. We conducted experiments using   phylogenetically distinct strains of marine Synechococcus (   Cyanobacteria) to test for a cost of resistance ( COR) to viral isolates   collected from Mount Hope Bay, Rhode Island. In addition, we examined   whether fitness costs ( 1) increased proportionally with `total   resistance', the number of viruses for which a strain had evolved   resistance, or ( 2) were determined more by `compositional resistance',   the identity of the viruses to which it evolved resistance. A COR was   only found in half of our experiments, which may be attributed to   compensatory mutations or the inability to detect a small COR. When   detected, the COR resulted in a similar to 20\% reduction in relative   fitness compared to ancestral strains. The COR was unaffected by total   resistance, suggesting a pleiotropic fitness response. Under competitive   conditions, however, the COR was dependent on compositional resistance,   suggesting that fitness costs were associated with the identity of a few   particular viruses. Our study provides the first evidence for a COR in   marine bacteria, and suggests that Synechococcus production may be   influenced by the composition of co-occurring viruses.",866,MAYBE,MAYBE,BH,done,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

Quantification of ecosystem   services or dis-services associated with pests is an important step in   identifying research and policy priorities for improving the performance   of CA practices. Using insect, weed and yield data from snap beans in a   three year vegetable rotation, we estimated the value of pest-regulating   services associated with the adoption of CA, and compared it to   establishment and management costs associated with implementing CA.   Experimental factors included tillage (full-width tillage [FM] or ST),   cover crops (winter rye [RI or none [NRI) and weed management   intensity (low or high). The value of pest. regulating services   associated with adoption of CA practices was estimated based on   pesticide cost savings associated with reductions in pest densities   given action thresholds typical of commercial snap bean production in   the North Central United States. CA practices had no detectable impact   on snap bean yields relative to FWT-NR, but resulted in significant   tradeoffs in weed and insect abundance. For example, in at least one of   two years, ST-R had lower densities of potato leafhopper, Powell   amaranth and winter annual weeds, but greater densities of tarnished   plant bug and large crabgrass compared to FWT-NR. CA practices had   variable effects on natural enemies including ladybeetles, spiders and   parasitoids, with no consistent impacts relative to FWT-NR. We estimated   that CA practices resulted in net pest-regulating dis-services with   costs of \$33 ha(-1) for FWT-R, \$25 ha(-1) for ST-NR, and \$14 ha(-1)   for ST-R. Under partial adoption of CA (ST-NR), pest-related costs were   completely offset by savings in tillage costs, resulting in estimated   short-term increases in net returns of \$26 ha(-1). In contrast,   complete adoption of CA (ST-R) resulted in greater pest and cover crop   management costs that outweighed savings due to reduced tillage,   resulting in estimated short-term losses of \$165 ha-(1.) In production   systems for which effective, low-cost pesticides are unavailable (e.g.   low-income countries) or prohibited (e.g. organic systems), the economic   impact of pest regulation services is likely to be greater than our   estimates suggest. Although CA practices provide several potential   long-term ecosystem services at both the farm and landscape level,   short-term impacts on pests and yields relative to the costs of   implementation are likely to be the major determinant of grower   adoption.

Biological control of crop pests is a major ecosystem service   affected by several variables acting at multiple spatial scales. Among   these variables, heterogeneity at the habitat and landscape scales are   known key drivers of trophic interactions and pest density in   agroecosystems. However, studies that try to disentangle their relative   effects in perennial cropping systems are scarce and nothing is known   about their impacts on insect pest density and pesticide applications.   2. We examined the effect of heterogeneity at these two scales on grape   moths, one of the most damaging insect pests in European vineyards, and   their biological control in 20 vineyards during three consecutive years.   We used local vegetation management and the proportion of semi-natural   habitats in the surrounding landscape as proxies of heterogeneity at the   habitat and landscape scales. Grape moth density was measured over time,   as well as biological control services provided by different groups:   birds, invertebrate predators, parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi.   3. Over the   3 years, grape moth density was mainly determined by local   heterogeneity, with significantly fewer larvae of the first generation   established in vineyards with full compared to partial grass cover.   4. Despite these effects, biological control of grape moths was not   primarily affected by local vegetation management but by landscape   heterogeneity, and the direction of this effect varied over time.   Notably, predation by birds increased with landscape heterogeneity in   spring, depending on local vegetation management, while attacks by   pathogenic fungi decreased with landscape heterogeneity during winter.   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that bottom-up   processes related to habitat heterogeneity drive grape moth occurrence   much more than top-down processes. These results have important   implications for the ecological intensification of vineyard landscapes.   We found that maintaining full grass cover within vineyards reduced   grape moth density to a level below common intervention thresholds.   Landscape heterogeneity in the close vicinity of vineyards contributed   to improved biological pest control by birds, but depended on local   vegetation management. Moreover, opposing effects of landscape   management on biological pest control services over time revealed that   strategies based only on manipulating landscape heterogeneity might not   be the optimal option to limit grape moth density in vineyards.",869,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

We investigated the   effects of long-term grazing disturbance of varying intensities (low   disturbed site, medially disturbed site, and seriously disturbed site)   on ecosystem biodiversity and functional process using soil nematode   communities. Soil physicochemical characteristics and plant communities   were also measured to explore the relationships between soil nematode   communities structure and key environment variable. Soil samples were   collected in May, June, August, and October, 2013. The abundance of   total nematode communities, plant feeders and bacterivores increased   with the grazing intensity increase, and predators decreased with   grazing intensity increase. Low disturbed site has the lowest abundance   of fungivores. Grazing disturbance has no significant influence on   abundance of omnivores (P > 0.05). Species richness was highest on   seriously disturbed site and lowest on low disturbed site. MI and SI   decreased as grazing intensity increase. The highest NCR was found in   low disturbed site and the lowest in medially disturbed site. The   highest El was found in medially disturbed site and the lowest in low   disturbed site. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that nematode   communities could be separated by three different grazing disturbance   intensity sites. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that Helicotylenchus,   Acrobeloides and Labronema were positively correlated with higher plant   communities diversity. Filenchus was positively correlated with forbs   biomass. Some omnivores such as Eudorylaimus and Aporcelaimus was   positively correlated with soil moisture and rich nutrient resources,   meanwhile, Enchodelus and Coomansus was positively correlated with   biomass of sedges and grasses.

However,   environmental stochasticity can alter this prediction, either because   competitive abilities depend on time-varying factors or because   covariance in species' responses to environmental conditions masks the   effect of competition. Interactions other than competition can also   influence community dynamics but have received less attention. We used a   simplified community of two sympatric duck species (redhead Aythya   americana and canvasback A. valisineria) and a previously published   analysis of 50 years of demographic data to parameterize a stochastic,   density-dependent, stage-structured model. These ducks interact via nest   parasitism (mostly of canvasback by redhead) in addition to competition   for food resources, with consequences at the demographic level; these   interactions are modulated by habitat availability (number of ponds in   the study landscape). We found that if habitat availability decreased   there was a high risk of quasi-extinction, and redheads, although   initially able to maintain their numerical dominance, quickly became the   least abundant species because they perform worse during droughts. If   habitat availability increased, we found that the initially more rare   canvasback would increase in relative abundance, albeit slowly. We   interpret this as a shift from a community influenced by nest parasitism   (which is detrimental to canvasback) to a community mostly driven by   species-specific dynamics due to relaxation of resource limitation.",872,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

This study compared the removal rates and   internal dynamics of Escherichia coli in a range of commonly used and   emerging subsurface flow systems designed for secondary treatment of   domestic sewage. Fifteen pilot-scale units were loaded with primary   treated sewage in Langenreichenbach, Germany and monitored at the inlet,   outlet and a several internal sample points between August 2010 and   December 2011. The compared systems spanned a range of energetic   intensification levels, including passive horizontal flow (HF) beds (25   cm versus 50 cm deep), moderately-intensified unsaturated pulse-loaded   (12 versus 24 times per day) vertical flow (VF) beds (gravel versus sand   media), and highly-intensified beds with aeration (HF versus VF) or   reciprocating fill and drain hydraulics. Planted (Phrag-mites australis)   and unplanted forms were compared for all designs except for the   reciprocating system (unplanted only). In general, there was no   significant effect of vegetation on E. coli removal. Despite receiving   the highest loading rates (131-146 L/m(2) d), the aerated HF systems and   the reciprocating system achieved the highest log concentration   reductions (2.8-4.0 log(10)) and the lowest effluent E. coli   concentrations (geometric mean less than 1 x 10(4) MPN/100 mL). The   gravel-based VF beds had the lowest log concentration reduction (0.8   logio) and highest effluent concentrations (6.4-8.9 x 10(5) MPN/100 mL)   at a hydraulic loading rate of 96 L/m(2) d. The design type had an   extremely significant effect on areal mass removal rates, with the   passive HF beds having the lowest removal rates (50 cm depth   significantly better than 25 cm), followed by the unsaturated VF systems   (which were not significantly different from one another), while the   aerated and reciprocating systems had the highest removal rates. Within   the unsaturated VF beds, the use of sand versus gravel substrate, or   hourly versus bi-hourly loading regime in the sand-based systems, had no   effect on areal load removal. The internal concentration profiles were   not significantly different between the unsaturated VF designs, with the   exception of the hourly-loaded, planted bed with sand media which had a   more rapid rate of concentration reduction with depth. In the HF beds,   the internal E. coli concentration reduction was significantly faster in   the aerated beds than in the non-aerated beds. Depth and plants had no   significant effect on the internal concentration profiles within the   non-aerated HF beds. Within the aerated systems, horizontal-flow   achieved better E. coli removal than vertical-flow. Subsurface flow   ecotechnologies offer great potential as robust and low-maintenance   solutions for reducing the pathogen risk associated with domestic   wastewater. The intensified systems produced effluent potentially   suitable for restricted surface irrigation, at the cost of higher energy   consumption, while the effluent from the other design types would   require subsurface irrigation or further disinfection prior to reuse.

B/CYDVs are   aphid-vectored RNA viruses that cause one of the most prevalent of all   plant diseases worldwide. Pathogen prevalence and coinfection were   uncorrelated, suggesting that different forces likely drive them.   Coinfection, the number of viruses in a single infected host (alpha   diversity), did not differ among host species but increased roughly   twofold across our latitudinal transect. This increase in coinfection   corresponded with a decline in among-host pathogen turnover (beta   diversity). suggesting that B/CYDVs in northern populations experience   less transmission limitation than in southern populations. In contrast   to pathogen diversity, pathogen prevalence was a function of host   identity as well as biotic and abiotic environmental conditions.   Prevalence declined with precipitation and increased with soil nitrate   concentration, an important limiting nutrient for hosts and vectors of   B/CYDVs.

These changes in climate, together with   direct effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration on plant   growth and transpiration, will influence factors such as soil water and   nitrogen availability that regulate the provisioning of plant and animal   products from rangelands. Ecological consequences of the major climate   change drivers-warming, precipitation modification, and CO2   enrichment-will vary among rangelands partly because temperature and   precipitation shifts will vary regionally, but also because driver   effects frequently are nonadditive, contingent on current environment   conditions, and interact synergistically with disturbance regimes and   human interventions. Consequences of climate change that are of special   relevance to rangelands are modification of forage quantity and quality,   livestock metabolism, and plant community composition. Warming is   anticipated to be accompanied by a decrease in precipitation in already   arid to semiarid rangelands in the southwestern USA, Central America,   and south and southwestern Australia. Higher temperatures combined with   drought will significantly impair livestock production by negatively   impacting animal physiological performance, increasing ectoparasite   abundances, and reducing forage quality and quantity. Conversely, the   warmer, wetter conditions anticipated in the northwestern USA, southern   Canada, and northern Asia may increase animal productivity by moderating   winter temperatures, lengthening the growing season, and increasing   plant productivity. Synergist interactions between climate change   drivers and other human impacts, including changes in land-use patterns,   intensification of disturbances, and species introductions and   movements, may further challenge ecosystem integrity and functionality.   Evidence from decades of research in the animal and ecological sciences   indicates that continued directional change in climate will   substantially modify ecosystem services provisioned by the world's   rangelands.",877,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Because black ash   often occurs in nearly pure stands, planting non-ash species is a   management strategy already underway or being planned for thousands of   acres. Tools are needed to assist managers in prioritizing sites for   early treatment and to select potential species to replace black ash.   This study explores the implications of threats to black ash ecosystems   using analyses of field data and models to assess both the threats to,   and potential replacement species for, black ash in Minnesota. For our   analysis we (1) assessed the status of ashes and co-occurring species in   forest inventory plots throughout Minnesota; (2) modeled the risk of EAB   attack for multiple years in Minnesota; (3) modeled potential impacts of   climate change on tree species with current or potential future habitat   in Minnesota; (4) evaluated species co-occurring with black ash in plots   in Ohio and Michigan, southeast of Minnesota; and (5) synthesized these   results to provide a classification for candidate replacement species,   both from within Minnesota and from points farther south.

The production of   strongly female-biased sex ratios, with low between group variance, is   selected for when single mothers produce groups of sibmating progeny.   Although the sex of progeny is determined at oviposition (primary sex   ratio), the selective value of given sexual compositions is often only   apparent when offspring mature and mate (secondary sex ratio). As   developmental mortality can alter the sexual composition of given   offspring groups, its occurrence can select for mothers to adjust their   (primary) sex allocation strategies as insurance against female-only   secondary sex ratios. Empirical assessment of primary sex ratios is   problematic when male and female eggs are indistinguishable. Here, we   apply DNA microsatellite markers to evaluate primary sex ratios in the   gregarious parasitoid Goniozus legneri Gordh (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae)   and compare these with secondary sex ratios. We find that sexually   differential mortality is absent or weak, but mortality acts to increase   sex ratio variance and to obscure initially present relationships   between sex ratio and group size. In some groups of offspring, there is   a tendency for males and females to be laid in spatial separation. Our   direct assessments of the sex of eggs avoid widespread problems inherent   in utilizing subsets of matured offspring groups with no mortality as   representative of overall primary sex ratios but, in this instance, it   also confirms interpretations made by studies constrained to employ   methods that are strictly incorrect.",880,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Microbial infection   during preincubation exposure has recently been shown as a second cause   of egg viability decline in the tropics, but whether microbial processes   influence the viability of wild bird eggs in temperate ecosystems is   unknown. We determined the microbial load on eggshells, the incidence of   microbial penetration of egg contents, and changes in the viability of   wild bird eggs (Sialia mexicana, Tachycineta bicolor, Tachycineta   thalassina) experimentally exposed to temperate-zone ambient conditions   in situ in a mediterranean climate in northern California. Initial   microbial loads on eggshells were generally low, although they were   significantly higher on eggs laid in old boxes than in new boxes.   Eggshell microbial loads did not increase with exposure to ambient   conditions, were not reduced by twice-daily disinfection with alcohol,   and were unaffected by parental incubation. The rate of microbial   penetration into egg contents was low and unaffected by the duration of   exposure. Nevertheless, egg viability declined very gradually and   significantly with exposure duration, and the rate of decline differed   among species. In contrast to studies performed in the tropics, we found   little evidence that temperature or microbial mechanisms of egg   viability decline were important at our temperate-zone site; neither   temperatures above physiological zero nor alcohol disinfection was   significantly related to hatching success. Delaying the onset of   incubation until the penultimate or last egg of a clutch at our study   site may maintain hatching synchrony without a large trade-off in egg   viability.

Plants have developed a variety of defence strategies against   herbivores. One possible strategy is the induced production of   metabolites following herbivore attack. Plant-associated micro-organisms   can be the source of such defensive compounds. For example, cool-season   grasses can be associated with systemic endophytic fungi of the genus   Epichloe, which produce herbivore-toxic alkaloids.   2. In a controlled common garden approach, we tested the hypothesis that   different types of herbivory induce endophyte growth and increase the   endophyte-mediated production of three bioactive alkaloids which can   deter or toxify herbivores. During 18 weeks, we analysed biweekly   endophyte and alkaloid concentrations in the grass Lolium perenne   infected with the endophytic fungus Epichloe festucae var. lolii. The   experiment was conducted throughout the field season and compared three   different herbivore treatments to the control treatment (herbivory   exclosure).   3. We showed that the concentration of the vertebrate toxic alkaloid   lolitrem B increased following clipping (a simulation of grazing   herbivores), while the insect deterring alkaloid peramine increased   following locust herbivory (biting-chewing herbivores). The endophyte   concentration increased slightly following clipping (P = 0.09). Sap   sucking aphids altered neither endophyte nor alkaloid concentrations.   4.

Rising to   this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from   diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological   processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies   for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic   process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a   London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases   increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully   characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We   use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease   forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector   populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen   amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study,   this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in   pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological   understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion   in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental   challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate   multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters,   (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3)   explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological   understanding.

However, there are concerns about urban soil quality and a   general lack of data on productivity in urban gardens. This study   investigated soil health via a comprehensive nematode food web analysis   and crop productivity via tomato fruit yield in community and market   gardens in Cleveland, Ohio, USA over a two-year period. Results revealed   that market gardens had significantly higher soil organic matter (SOM)   and NH4-N than community gardens in 2011. While there was no difference   between market gardens and community gardens in terms of nematode   abundances (except bacteria-feeding nematodes in 2011), market gardens   had higher nematode combined maturity index than community gardens in   2011. However, plant-parasitic index was lower in market gardens than in   community gardens in 2011. There was no difference in tomato fruit yield   in either year between the garden types, but tomato growth responses   including leaf dry weight ratio, and plant surface area differed between   market and community gardens in 2012. Different weather and related soil   and growing conditions likely contributed to the large variation   observed between 2011 and 2012; still, soils in market gardens tended to   support greater growth and yield than community gardens. Regardless,   there was no direct evidence that the gardens were nutrient limited,   thereby minimizing the potential for nutrient limitations to contribute   to yield differences.

Understanding the limits of consumption is important for determining   trophic influences on ecosystems and predator adaptations to   inconsistent prey availability. Fishes have been observed to consume   beyond what is sustainable (i.e. digested on a daily basis), but this   phenomenon of hyperphagia (or binge-feeding) is largely overlooked. We   expect hyperphagia to be a short-term (1-day) event that is facilitated   by gut volume providing capacity to store consumed food during periods   of high prey availability to be later digested.   2. We define how temperature, body size and food availability influence   the degree of binge-feeding by comparing field observations with   laboratory experiments of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), a large   freshwater piscivore that experiences highly variable prey pulses. We   also simulated bull trout consumption and growth during salmon smolt   outmigrations under two scenarios: 1) daily consumption being dependent   upon bioenergetically sustainable rates and 2) daily consumption being   dependent upon available gut volume (i.e. consumption is equal to gut   volume when empty and otherwise `topping off' based on sustainable   digestion rates).   3. One-day consumption by laboratory-held bull trout during the first   day of feeding experiments after fasting exceeded bioenergetically   sustainable rates by 12- to 87-fold at low temperatures (3 degrees C)   and by similar to 1.3-fold at 20 degrees C. The degree of binge-feeding   by bull trout in the field was slightly reduced but largely in agreement   with laboratory estimates, especially when prey availability was   extremely high [during a sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolt   outmigration and at a counting fence where smolts are funnelled into   high densities]. Consumption by bull trout at other settings were lower   and more variable, but still regularly hyperphagic.   4. Simulations demonstrated the ability to binge-feed increased   cumulative consumption (16-32\%) and cumulative growth (19-110\%)   relative to only feeding at bioenergetically sustainable rates during   the similar to 1-month smolt outmigration period.   5. Our results indicate the ability for predators to maximize short-term   consumption when prey are available can be extreme and is limited   primarily by gut volume, then mediated by temperature; thus,   predator-prey relationships may be more dependent upon prey availability   than traditional bioenergetic models suggest. Binge-feeding has   important implications for energy budgets of consumers as well as acute   predation impacts on prey.",885,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

In this type of environment,   species called ``cushion plants'' can ameliorate the stressful   conditions, acting as nurses for other plants. Of the several mechanisms   proposed in the positive-interactions framework, plant-microorganism   interaction may be one of the most common, but least documented. Here we   show that the presence of endophytes isolated from the roots of cushion   plants Laretia acaulis can play a fundamental role in the establishment,   performance and survival of both native and exotic plant seedlings that   are known to be facilitated by the cushion species.   To test this, we measured survival and growth of two native and one   invasive species at 3200 m in the Andes of Central Chile. Plants were   grown inside artificial cushions filled with native soil, with or   without sterilization, and with or without fungal endophytic inoculation   to evaluate the role of fungal endophytes on survival and growth. In   addition, we conducted a second experiment in a greenhouse with the   invasive species to evaluate the effect of fungal endophytic   infection/association on plant ecophysiological performance, dry biomass   and seed output.   Overall, our results showed a strong positive effect of fungal   endophytes on the survival and growth of both native and invasive   species, Moreover, maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm), biomass   accumulation and seed production were enhanced in the invasive species   when soils were inoculated with endophytes. Thus, facilitation by root   endophytic fungi on native and invasive alpine plants could determine   survival and establishment in this harsh environment.   Several studies have shown that direct facilitation by cushion plants in   alpine environments improves the performance and fitness of both native   and exotic plants. Our results suggest that there are indirect effects,   mediated by microorganism associations that may also help to explain the   successful establishment of native and invasive species in these   environments. If indirect plant-plant facilitation through root fungal   endophytes proves to be a widespread phenomenon in alpine ecosystems, it   could be a key component in the structuring of plant communities in   those stressful environments.

However, it is less clear how predators'   nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) scale with increasing predator   biodiversity. We examined NCEs exerted on Culex mosquitoes by a diverse   community of aquatic predators. In the field, mosquito larvae   co-occurred with differing densities and species compositions of   mesopredator insects; top predator dragonfly naiads were present in   roughly half of surveyed water bodies. We reproduced these predator   community features in artificial ponds, exposing mosquito larvae to   predator cues and measuring resulting effects on mosquito traits   throughout development. Nonconsumptive effects of various combinations   of mesopredator species reduced the survival of mosquito larvae to   pupation, and reduced the size and longevity of adult mosquitoes that   later emerged from the water. Intriguingly, adding single dragonfly   naiads to ponds restored survivorship of larval mosquitoes to levels   seen in the absence of predators, and further decreased adult mosquito   longevity compared with mosquitoes emerging from mesopredator   treatments. Behavioral observations revealed that mosquito larvae   regularly deployed diving escape behavior in the presence of the   mesopredators, but not when a dragonfly naiad was also present. This   suggests that dragonflies may have relaxed NCEs of the mesopredators by   causing mosquitoes to abandon energetically costly diving. Our study   demonstrates that adding one individual of a functionally unique species   can substantially alter community-wide NCEs of predators on prey. For   pathogen vectors like mosquitoes, this could in turn influence disease   dynamics.",887,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Knowledge of infection reservoir dynamics is critical for effective   disease control, but identifying reservoirs of multi-host pathogens is   challenging. Here, we synthesize several lines of evidence to   investigate rabies reservoirs in complex carnivore communities of the   Serengeti ecological region in northwest Tanzania, where the disease has   been confirmed in 12 carnivore species.   2. Long-term monitoring data suggest that rabies persists in   high-density domestic dog Canis familiaris populations (> 11 dogs   km(-2)) and occurs less frequently in lower-density (< 5 dogs km(-2))   populations and only sporadically in wild carnivores.   3. Genetic data show that a single rabies virus variant belonging to the   group of southern Africa canid-associated viruses (Africa 1b) circulates   among a range of species, with no evidence of species-specific   virus-host associations.   4. Within-species transmission was more frequently inferred from   high-resolution epidemiological data than between-species transmission.   Incidence patterns indicate that spill-over of rabies from domestic dog   populations sometimes initiates short-lived chains of transmission in   other carnivores.   5. Synthesis and applications. The balance of evidence suggests that the   reservoir of rabies in the Serengeti ecosystem is a complex multi-host   community where domestic dogs are the only population essential for   persistence, although other carnivores contribute to the reservoir as   non-maintenance populations. Control programmes that target domestic dog   populations should therefore have the greatest impact on reducing the   risk of infection in all other species including humans, livestock and   endangered wildlife populations, but transmission in other species may   increase the level of vaccination coverage in domestic dog populations   necessary to eliminate rabies.",890,MAYBE,MAYBE,BH,done,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

Strong effects of parasitism   should result in substantial changes in diversity and declines in   productivity. Conversely, strong litter effects should result in minor   changes in diversity and increased productivity. We conducted   field-based surveys to determine the association of Castilleja   occidentalis with diversity and productivity in the alpine tundra. To   examine litter effects, we compared the decomposition of Castilleja   litter with litter of four other abundant plant species, and examined   the decomposition of those four species when mixed with Castilleja.

Our decomposition trials suggest litter effects are due to both   the rapid N loss of Castilleja litter and the effects of mixing   Castilleja litter with co-occurring species. Castilleja produces litter   that accelerates decomposition in the alpine tundra, which could   accelerate the slow N cycle and boost productivity. We speculate that   these positive effects of litter outweigh the effects of parasitism in   nutrient-poor systems with long-lived hemiparasites. Determining the   relative importance of parasitism and litter effects of this functional   group is crucial to understand the strong but variable roles   hemiparasites play in affecting community structure and ecosystem   processes.",892,YES,YES,BH,done,yes,,

Although the   influence of landscape factors associated with farming effects on   arthropod assemblages has received increasing attention in the last   decades, most research was carried out in fine-grain landscapes by   comparing conventional and organic cropping systems. Here, we aimed at   identifying the role of fencerows and crop heterogeneity in defining   arthropod diversity in intensively farmed, coarse-grain landscapes.   Hence, we developed a multi-scale heterogeneity approach based on   fitting linear-mixed models to elucidate the effects of three spatial   scales (local, neighbouring crop types, and landscape) on arthropod   diversity. Mixed models were fitted to arthropod data obtained by   pitfall trap samplings in 22 field pairs. Field position was a major   determinant of arthropod species diversity at local scale, due to the   contrasting disturbance regimes of fencerows and adjoining field edges.   Fence density at landscape scale contributed to retain diverse arthropod   assemblages in farmland mosaics by supplying habitats and refuges. In   addition, extended fence network may function as corridors for   dispersal, increasing connectivity between dissimilar habitats. Fence   habitats, as well as their density in the landscapes, enhance both   richness and abundance of beneficial arthropods. Our findings indicate   that the overall arthropod diversity was benefited by landscape   complexity, being the presence and density of fencerows key landscape   attributes. Contrasting disturbance regimes at different field positions   emerged as a major driver modulating arthropod species diversity in   intensively managed farmland mosaics. Non-cropped habitats associated   with fencerows and field margins play key ecological functions that are   of vital importance for providing ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems.   Complex landscapes may help to conserve overall plant diversity in   agro-ecosystems, as well as the spillover of arthropod species from   fencerows towards crop fields. Even in heavily intensified landscapes,   where crop diversity is the main source of heterogeneity, promoting   measures intended for both restoring and managing fencerow and   non-cropped habitats through landscape planning will contribute to   maintain arthropod richness (almost 70\% of total richness) across the   entire landscape.

By 2050, globally we   have to solve severe water and phosphorus shortages while significantly   decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. In this review and opinion paper,   the ZeroWasteWater concept is proposed as a sustainable centralised   technology train to short-cycle water, energy and valuable materials   from sewage, while adequately abating pathogens, heavy metals and trace   organics. Electrical energy recovery from anaerobic digestion of the   organics present in sewage and kitchen waste (KW) has a value of 4.0 per   inhabitant equivalent (IE) per year. In addition to sewerage   improvements and water conservation, prerequisites include an advanced   physico-chemical and/or biological concentration step at the entry of   the sewage treatment plant. In the side stream, the recovery of   phosphorus and carbon-sequestrating biochar from the digested sludge and   of nitrogen from the digestate has a value of 6.3IE-1 year-1.   Alternatively, recovery of biogas and materials can occur directly on   source-separated black water. In the main stream, partial nitritation   and anammox oxidise residual nitrogen. Moreover, two serial heat pumps   recover thermal energy, valued at 6.9IE-1 year-1, cooling the water by 5   degrees C, and membrane technologies recover potable water at 65IE-1   year-1. Interestingly, ZeroWasteWater is expected to be economically   viable.

Understanding how this   occurs in parasite-host systems is important for appreciating long-term   and seasonal changes in host exposure to infection and to reduce species   extinction caused by diseases. We investigated how free-living stages of   two soil-transmitted helminths of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus   cuniculus) responded to experimental changes in temperature by   performing laboratory experiments with environmental chambers and field   manipulations using open-top-chambers. This study was motivated by our   previous observations that air temperature has increased over the last   30years in our field site and that during this period intensity of   infection of Graphidium strigosum but not Trichostrongylus   retortaeformis was positively associated with this temperature increase.   Laboratory and field experiments showed that both parasites accelerated   egg development and increased hatching rate and larval survival in   response to accumulating thermal energy. Both parasites behaved   similarly when exposed to diverse temperature regimes, decadal trends,   and monthly fluctuations, however, T. retortaeformis was more successful   than G. strigosum by showing higher rates of egg hatching and larval   survival. Across the months, the first day of hatching occurred earlier   in warmer conditions suggesting that climate warming can lengthen the   period of parasite growth and host exposure to infective stages. Also,   T. retortaeformis hatched earlier than G. strigosum. These findings   showed that seasonal changes in intensity, frequency, and duration of   daily temperature are important causes of variability in egg hatching   and larva survival. Overall, this study emphasizes the important role of   climate warming and seasonality on the dynamics of free-living stages in   soil-transmitted helminths and their contribution to enhance host   exposure to parasitic infections.

Second, changes in   activity patterns and disrupted biological rhythms are expected to   reduce behavioral synchrony in social processes such as reproduction,   migration, and dispersal. Third, increased light at night is expected to   affect the communication between individuals; primarily, it will   increase the opportunities for visual social information transfer. Last,   artificial nighttime light is expected to lower social competence, with   subsequent negative effects on aggressive interactions and group   coordination.

We used data collected over a 16-year period   to examine population dynamics of a tagged population of C. florida in a   6.4 ha area in the context of change in the protected Quercus-Carya   forest of the Ross Biological Reserve, Indiana. We examined the   hypothesis that forest dynamics result from interactions between   long-term ecological succession and pathogens. The C. florida population   at the Ross Reserve declined by 50\% between 1983 and 2000, with a   survivorship of 24\%. Analysis of 40 years of forest survey data showed   that Quercus and Carya populations declined in importance, while Acer   saccharum increased dramatically. This change in forest structure is   consistent with successional changes occurring throughout the Midwest   and can be attributed to suppression of disturbance. Cornus florida   declined more sharply where A. saccharum increased. From 1983 to 1999,   C. florida were less likely to survive if they were within 5 m of a A.   saccharum. Light measurements showed that A. saccharum abundance   correlated negatively with light available to C. florida, suggesting   that increased shading by A. saccharum contributed to C. florida   decline. The fungus, Discula destructiva causes the disease dogwood   anthracnose that is associated with widespread decline of C. florida in   the eastern United States.

Plants can host microbial communities whose integrated functions are   often responsible for their success. Understanding mechanisms regulating   such functions is thus a major goal in ecology.   2. Fungal endophytes of grasses, particularly of the genus Neotyphodium,   have been reported to reduce colonization of their host plant by   arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, it is unclear which   mechanism(s) may explain the effects produced by the endophyte and   whether these effects are present in nature.   3. We used Schedonorus phoenix (syn. Lolium arundinaceum) plants that   were endophyte-free or infected with one of two strains of Neotyphodium   coenophialum known to produce different putative allelochemicals to test   the hypotheses that (i) allelopathic effects of the endophyte reduce AM   fungal spore germination; and (ii) the allelochemical compound(s) are   leached into the soil even after the death of S. phoenix, where they   reduce AM fungal colonization of other plants.   4. In a first experiment, aqueous extracts from the shoots of S. phoenix   were applied onto spores of the AM fungus Glomus intraradices to test   germination effects. Both endophyte strains reduced spore germination by   approximately 10\% relative to endophyte-free controls.   5. In a second experiment, we placed dried shoot material ('thatch') on   the soil surface of pots containing Bromus inermis, which were either   inoculated with G. intraradices or not. We watered the plants through   the thatch, relying upon leaching to translocate potential   allelochemicals to the soil. AM fungal colonization of B. inermis was   significantly reduced when thatch was infected with the common strain,   but not with AR542, compared to the endophyte-free thatch. Furthermore,   the arbuscule : vesicle ratio was 11-fold smaller when thatch was   infected with the common strain compared to endophyte-free thatch,   suggesting that G. intraradices was stressed by the presence of common   strain-leachate.   6. We observed situations whereby two ecologically widespread   plant-microbe symbioses interact. Potential mechanisms may include   allelopathic effects, although other factors are also possible, and   leaching is a mode of entry of putative endophyte-induced AM fungal   inhibitors in soil.

Using natural   dispersal and deliberate seed addition into grassland communities with   different compositional and richness histories, we show that invaders   establish in a nonrandom manner due to negative effects of resident   functional groups on invading species from the same functional group.   Invaders hence complement communities with originally low richness   levels. Consequently, communities converge toward similar levels of   species richness, high functional richness, and evenness, but not always   maximum productivity. Invasion processes are faster but qualitatively   similar when the effect of chance, in the form of dispersal   stochasticity, is reduced by seed addition. Thus, dispersal limitation   may influence community assembly, but it does not override functionally   predictable assembly mechanisms. Some of the most productive communities   prior to invasion are unstable in the face of invasion, leading to   decreased productivity following invasion. We suggest that invasion into   Such communities Occurs possibly because a pathogen-free niche is   available rather than a resource niche.

Specifically, we massed larval and adult parasites   representing 13 species and five life stages of trematodes and cestodes   from snail and amphibian hosts. We used a replicated regression approach   to quantify dry mass and compared these values with indirect biovolume   estimates to test the validity of density assumptions.

Among similar morphotypes, direct estimates of dry mass and the   traditional biovolume technique provided generally comparable estimates   (although important exceptions also emerged). Finally, we present   generalized length-mass regression equations to calculate trematode mass   from length measurements, and discuss the most efficient use of limited   numbers of parasites.

Verticillium longisporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and   Alternaria brassicae could be particularly favoured, but beneficial   effects may also occur for certain life cycle stages of Phoma lingam,   such as infection and stem canker development. Pyrenopeziza brassicae   might even lose importance under future warming. These changes may be   particularly explicit in the long-term view (2071-2100). However,   predictions on potential disease shifts are restricted by a lack of   reliable, high-resolution future climate scenarios and complicated by   the prospective adaptations of farming techniques and crop genotypes to   climate change.

Schistosoma mansoni adapts rapidly to new (allopatric) strains of its   intermediate host. To study the importance of epimutations in this   process, we infected sympatric and allopatric mollusc strains with   parasite clones. ChIP-Seq was carried out on four histone modifications   (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac and H4K20me1) in parallel with genomewide   DNA resequencing (i) on parasite larvae shed by the infected snails and   (ii) on adult worms that had developed from the larvae. No change in   single nucleotide polymorphisms and no mobilization of transposable   elements were observed, but 58-105 copy number variations (CNVs) within   the parasite clones in different molluscs were detected. We also   observed that the allopatric environment induces three types of   chromatin structure changes: (i) host-induced changes on larvae   epigenomes in 51 regions of the genome that are independent of the   parasites' genetic background, (ii) spontaneous changes (not related to   experimental condition or genotype of the parasite) at 64 locations and   (iii) 64 chromatin structure differences dependent on the parasite   genotype. Up to 45\% of the spontaneous, but none of the host-induced   chromatin structure changes were transmitted to adults. In our model,   the environment induces epigenetic changes at specific loci but only   spontaneous epimutations are mitotically heritable and have therefore   the potential to contribute to transgenerational inheritance.

Specificity of the beetle-fungus relationship has rarely been   examined, and simple vertical transmission of a specific fungal cultivar   by each beetle species is often assumed in literature. We report   repeated evolution of fungal crop stealing, termed mycocleptism, among   ambrosia beetles. The mycocleptic species seek brood galleries of other   species, and exploit their established fungal gardens by tunneling   through the ambient mycelium-laden wood. Instead of carrying their own   fungal sybmbionts, mycocleptae depend on adopting the fungal assemblages   of their host species, as shown by an analysis of fungal DNA from beetle   galleries. The evidence for widespread horizontal exchange of fungi   between beetles challenges the traditional concept of ambrosia fungi as   species-specific symbionts. Fungus stealing appears to be an   evolutionarily successful strategy. It evolved independently in several   beetle clades, two of which have radiated, and at least one case was   accompanied by a loss of the beetles' fungus-transporting organs.

However, simple identification of a feedback alone may not be   enough to establish feedbacks as a mechanism behind plant invasion. I   suggest that the relationship between soil community density and plant   growth is an important unknown that strongly influences the impact of   plant-soil feedbacks. I developed a mathematical model of two-plant   species competition with plant-soil feedbacks. Each plant species   obligately generates its own soil community. Each soil community then   influences both plant species' growth. The model allows for every   possible combination of positive and negative effects of the soil   community on plant growth. I model the relationship between soil   community density and plant growth with non-linear functional responses.   I use a range of plant competitive abilities and feedback scenarios from   the literature to explore how different functional responses influence   the outcome of plant competition. Sensitivity analysis of the model   reveals that altering the relationship between feedback strength and   soil community development can reverse the outcome of plant competition.   Analysis of the model also shows how the importance of different   feedback scenarios depends on the strength of plant competition. (C)   2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",911,NO,,BH,check,,,

Consequently, mating patterns in remnant   tree populations are expected to shift towards increased inbreeding and   reduced pollen diversity, with fitness consequences for future   generations. However, mating patterns and phenotypic assessments of   open-pollinated progeny have rarely been combined in a single study.   Here, we collected seeds from 37 Eucalyptus incrassata trees from   contrasting stand densities following recent clearance in a single South   Australian population (intact woodland = 12.6 trees ha(-1); isolated   pasture = 1.7 trees ha(-1); population area = 10 km(2)). 649 progeny   from these trees were genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. We   estimated genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, indirect   contemporary pollen flow and mating patterns for adults older than the   clearance events and open-pollinated progeny sired post-clearance. A   proxy of early stage progeny viability was assessed in a common garden   experiment. Density had no impact on mating patterns, adult and progeny   genetic diversity or progeny growth, but was associated with increased   mean pollen dispersal. Weak spatial genetic structure among adults   suggests high historical gene flow. We observed preliminary evidence for   inbreeding depression related to stress caused by fungal infection, but   which was not associated with density. Higher observed heterozygosities   in adults compared with progeny may relate to weak selection on progeny   and lifetime-accumulated mortality of inbred adults.

These relationships, studied mainly through   neutral DNA markers, are not always consistent with actual biogeographic   patterns or the evolutionary history of marine species. In addition,   increased information at functional genomic level from non-model species   allows the study of adaptive responses in marine populations. This work   reports local transcriptomic patterns in populations of the mussel   Mytilus chilensis and their correspondence with oceanographic   variability in southern Chile. Analysis of gene expression patterns was   conducted through qPCR of seven candidate genes involved in the response   to environmental stress (HSP70, HSP90), iron metabolism (Ferritin),   pathogens (Mytilin B, Defensin) and oxidative stress (SOD-CuZn,   Catalase) in at five study sites located in southern Chile, from   Valdivia (39 degrees 56'S-73 degrees 36'W) to Melinka (43 degrees   52'S-73 degrees 44'W). Multivariate and correlation analyses were used   to assess the relationship between levels of individual gene expression   and site features characterized using satellite data on surface   temperature, chlorophyll concentration and total suspended sediments.   Two main groups of sites with differential patterns of gene expression   were identified. Individuals exposed to higher temperatures showed an   overexpression of HSP70, HSP90 and Ferritin genes. The expression of   SOD-CuZn and Catalase was correlated with local chlorophyll-a (i.e. food   availability for mussels), although with opposite correlations. In   addition, Mytilin B showed higher levels of expression in areas with   higher freshwater influence. Patterns of gene expression across the   region of interest suggest that spatial variability in environmental   conditions induce phenotypic changes in different populations of the   same mussel species.

Most importantly, global   trade and climate change are increasing the threat to forest ecosystems   posed by new diseases. Various studies relevant to forest pathology in a   changing world are accumulating, thus making it necessary to provide an   update of recent literature. In this contribution, we summarize research   at the interface between forest pathology and landscape ecology,   biogeography, global change science and research on tree endophytes.   Regional outbreaks of tree diseases are requiring interdisciplinary   collaboration, e.g. between forest pathologists and landscape   ecologists. When tree pathogens are widely distributed, the factors   determining their broad-scale distribution can be studied using a   biogeographic approach. Global change, the combination of climate and   land use change, increased pollution, trade and urbanization, as well as   invasive species, will influence the effects of forest disturbances such   as wildfires, droughts, storms, diseases and insect outbreaks, thus   affecting the health and resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide. Tree   endophytes can contribute to biological control of infectious diseases,   enhance tolerance to environmental stress or behave as opportunistic   weak pathogens potentially competing with more harmful ones. New   molecular techniques are available for studying the complete tree   endobiome under the influence of global change stressors from the   landscape to the intercontinental level. Given that exotic tree diseases   have both ecologic and economic consequences, we call for increased   interdisciplinary collaboration in the coming decades between forest   pathologists and researchers studying endophytes with tree geneticists,   evolutionary and landscape ecologists, biogeographers, conservation   biologists and global change scientists and outline interdisciplinary   research gaps.",914,NO,,BH,check,,,

Based on measurements of foliar delta N-15 or foliar delta   N-15(fol-soil) in seedlings collected from 33 nurseries, we compared the   effect of an AM-mediated process on nitrogen resource use between   shrubland and ploughed soils. In mycorrhizal seedlings growing in   shrubland soils, both foliar delta N-15 and foliar delta N-15 (fol-soil)   were significantly higher than those in ploughed soils, likely because   of enhanced high delta N-15/NO3- absorption through AM-mediated   pathways. Those results showed that foliar delta N-15 typically   reflected the isotopic signature of the source pools of N. We suggest   that the dominant N form taken up by fir seedlings growing in ploughed   soils was NH4+-N rather than NO3--N, where colonized root epidermis play   an important role in exploiting soil N resource. However, the N form   taken up by fir seedling growing in shrubland soils was primarily NO3--N   compared to NH4+-N. which is attributed to the high efficiency in an   AM-mediated process rather than the dominance of N species in the   different habitats. It is conceivable that combined colonized root   epidermis with AM-mediated process may be more important than root   epidermis alone in exploiting different forms of N in nursery soils.   Therefore, in low N and acidic ecosystems, species other than the   dominant N-NH4+, should be considered to satisfy the N demand for   Chinese fir survival and growth, while the efficiency of an AM-mediated   process should be determined by soil abiotic conditions.

There can also be unintended   consequences for other parts of the ecosystem, especially in complex   food webs. In making decisions managers generally have to rely on   qualitative information collected in a piecemeal fashion. A method to   assist decision making is a qualitative modelling approach using fuzzy   cognitive maps, a directed graphical model related to neural networks   that can take account of interactions between pests and conservation   assets in complex food webs. Using all available information on   relationships between native and exotic resources and consumers, we   generated hypotheses about potential consequences of single-species and   multi-species pest control on the long-term equilibrium abundances of   other biotic components of an ecosystem. We applied the model to a   dryland ecosystem in New Zealand because we had good information on its   trophic structure, but the information on the strength of species   interactions was imprecise. Our model suggested that pest control is   unlikely to significantly boost native invertebrates and lizards in this   ecosystem, suggesting that other forms of management may be required for   these groups. Most of the pest control regimes tested resulted in   greater abundances of at least one other pest species, which could   potentially lead to other management problems. Some of the predictions   were unexpected, such as more birds resulting from possum and mouse   control. We also modelled the effects of an increase in invasive   rabbits, which led to unexpected declines of stoats, weasels, mice and   possums. These unexpected outcomes resulted from complex indirect   pathways in the food web. Fuzzy cognitive maps allow rapid construction   of prototype models of complex food webs using a wide range of data and   expert opinion.

This study described stand development patterns in the   mixed-conifer forests and quantified stand and tree growth response to   the loss of sugar pine. Stratification patterns tended to follow   patterns of shade tolerance with the more shade tolerant species found   in lower canopy positions. Growth response was analyzed following the   initial entry of blister rust and after more recent sugar pine   mortality. Following the initial wave of mortality induced by blister   rust, overstory trees and most individual species increased overall   basal area growth. Although most species also responded to recent sugar   pine mortality (occurring within the past ten years) by increasing basal   area growth, the increase was only significant for white fir. Mortality   of sugar pine has favored other conifer species, leading to changes in   species dominance and negative effects on understory growth of sugar   pine; release of these trees could improve overstory recruitment of   sugar pine. However, due to the increased growth of white fir, any   management strategies aimed at restoring sugar pine must also consider   white fir management.",917,MAYBE,,BH,check,yes,,

Endangered Japanese trout (Salvelinus   leucomaenis japonicus) readily ate these infected orthopterans, which   due to their abundance, accounted for 60\% of the annual energy intake   of the trout population. Trout grew fastest in the fall, when   nematomorphs were driving energy-rich orthopterans into the stream. When   infected orthopterans were available, trout did not eat benthic   invertebrates in proportion to their abundance, leading to the potential   for cascading, indirect effects through the forest-stream ecosystem.

Characterizing   spatio-temporal variation in mortality (including disturbance) and its   effects on forest and carbon dynamics is thus essential to understanding   the current global forest carbon sink, and to predicting how it will   change in future. We analyzed forest inventory data from the eastern   United States to estimate plot-level variation in mortality (relative to   a long-term background rate for individual trees) for nine distinct   forest regions. Disturbances that produced at least a fourfold increase   in tree mortality over an approximately 5 year interval were observed in   15\% of plots in each forest region. The frequency of disturbance was   lowest in the northeast, and increased southwards along the Atlantic and   Gulf coasts as fire and hurricane disturbances became progressively more   common. Across the central and northern parts of the region, natural   disturbances appeared to reflect a diffuse combination of wind, insects,   disease, and ice storms. By linking estimated covariation in tree growth   and mortality over time with a data-constrained forest dynamics model,   we simulated the implications of stochastic variation in mortality for   long-term aboveground biomass changes across the eastern United States.   A geographic gradient in disturbance frequency induced notable   differences in biomass dynamics between the least- and most-disturbed   regions, with variation in mortality causing the latter to undergo   considerably stronger fluctuations in aboveground stand biomass over   time. Moreover, regional simulations showed that a given long-term   increase in mean mortality rates would support greater aboveground   biomass when expressed through disturbance effects compared with   background mortality, particularly for early-successional species.

Thus, it remains unclear whether these biodiversity   mechanisms are important determinants of consumption in entire predator   prey assemblages, such that food-web interaction structure determines   community-wide consumption and stability.   Here, we use empirical quantitative food webs to study the   community-wide effects of functional complementarity and redundancy of   consumers (parasitoids) on herbivore control in temperate forests. We   find that complementarity in host resource use by parasitoids was a   strong predictor of absolute parasitism rates at the community level and   that redundancy in host-use patterns stabilized community-wide   parasitism rates in space, but not through time. These effects can   potentially explain previous contradictory results from predator   diversity research. Phylogenetic diversity (measured using taxonomic   distance) did not explain functional complementarity or parasitism   rates, so could not serve as a surrogate measure for functional   complementarity.

The entire life cycle of the intertidal trematode parasite Maritrema   novaezealandensis was modelled in order to investigate the interactive   effects of parasitic infections and increasing temperatures on the   population dynamics of the amphipod host Paracalliope novizealandiae.   Despite uncertainties associated with the model and its   parameterisation, most temperature increases that were predicted to   cause the collapse of the modelled amphipod population in the long term   lay within the range of predicted warming for the study area. The high   vulnerability of the amphipods in the modelled system illustrates a   potentially important ecological mechanism by which consequences of a   global problem might manifest on the local scale.",925,NO,,BH,check,,,

We developed a   statistical model to simultaneously estimate effects of fishing and   disease on oysters in upper Chesapeake Bay during 1980 to 2009. We   compared the model estimates of abundance in 2009 to that prior to   large-scale commercial fishing.

In the Mediterranean Sea, the number of fish   farms has increased dramatically from early `80s in coastal waters,   releasing a substantial amount of organic matter, modifying the habitat   and communities beneath cages and changing the spatio-temporal   distribution of species. Among all the effects derived from fish   farming, escape events of cultured fish are a relevant issue for   management given their potential impact over wild counterparts in terms   of habitat and food competition, genetic flow, biodiversity, spread   diseases or parasites, and interaction with local fisheries, decreasing   the price of the catches. This paper shows the first approach to model   the temporal trends of biomass and yields of escapes from aquaculture by   means of an EwE model. Three levels of escapes ( x 1, ordinary level:   5000 ind year(-1) fish farm(-1), corresponding to 1.31 t year(-1);   massive event: ordinary level x 91; total destruction of fish farm:   ordinary level x 1800) and four levels of fishing effort (ordinary E,   x2, x5, x10) were modelled as mechanism to recapture escapees. Temporal   variation of biomass and yield is used to define how long should be   maintained the effort to catch escapees. The total destruction of a fish   farm generates the higher increase of escapees' landings, dissapearing   in less than 6 months if fishing effort reach 10-fold the ordinary   fishing effort. Differences among revenues from recaptures and derived   expenses were always negative but tending to be greater for low levels   of fishing effort and/or levels of escapes which means no fishery can be   expected to be maintained by escapes. In general, fleets benefit from   escapees in terms of yield but gains will depend on how escapees affect   either positively or negatively the value of the catch. Simulations   using EwE models may result a useful tool to design suitable recapture   plans of escapees. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",927,NO,,BH,check,,,

However, there is a concern over the capacity of   urban soil to provide sustainable and safe food production. We tested   the effectiveness of several soil health indicators to predict food crop   productivity and quality in vacant lots in a disadvantaged neighborhood   in the city of Cleveland, Ohio. We defined soil health as a state of   composite well being in terms of biological, chemical, and physical   properties of the soil as they relate to crop productivity. Twelve   city-owned vacant lots, three close to each of the four city schools,   were selected for soil properties and plant growth analyses. Soil   samples were analyzed for pH, moisture content (theta v), soil texture,   soil organic matter (SOM), active carbon (AC), ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate   (NO3-N), microbial biomass N (MBN), and nematode community parameters   including total (TNN), bacteria-feeding (BFN), fungal-feeding (FFN), and   plant-parasitic (PPN) nematodes, number of nematode genera (NNG), and   nematode food web enrichment index (EI) and structure index (SI).   Lettuce was planted in the selected vacant lots and its growth was   documented through measures of dry biomass, numbers of leaves/plant, and   complementary subjective appearance scores related to physiological   status. All measured parameters varied considerably among vacant lots   except soil pH. Principal components analysis revealed that among the   primary soil physical, chemical, and biological parameters, soil clay,   NO3-N, MBN, SOM, AC, TNN, BFN, FFN, and PPN contributed most to the   variance of the entire dataset. There were also several positive   correlations among these key soil health predictor variables: AC was   positively correlated with clay, SOM, MBN, TNN, BFN, FFN and PPN, and   TNN was positively correlated with AC, SOM, MBN, BFN, FFN and PPN. Of   the identified primary soil health indicators, only clay, SOM, and MBN   positively correlated with lettuce dry biomass, which was also   positively correlated with a secondary soil health indicator, the   nematode food web EI. Lettuce leaf necrosis was negatively correlated   with clay, AC, SOM, MBN, TNN, FFN, and PPN, and the proportion of   withered leaves was negatively correlated only with SOM. It is concluded   that AC, PPN, TNN, SOM, MBN, clay, and nematode food web EI can serve as   important soil health indicators that have potential for predicting crop   productivity and quality in urban soils.

Anthropogenic stressors may influence hosts and their pathogens   directly or may alter host-pathogen dynamics indirectly through   interactions with other species.

Conversely, pathogens can influence community structure and   function and are increasingly recognised as important members of the   ecological communities in which they exist.   2. In outdoor mesocosms, we experimentally manipulated nutrients   (nitrogen and phosphorus) and the presence of a fungal pathogen,   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and examined the effects on Bd   abundance on larval amphibian hosts (Pseudacris regilla: Hylidae),   amphibian traits and community dynamics. We predicted that resource   supplementation would mitigate negative effects of Bd on tadpole growth   and development and that indirect effects of treatments would propagate   through the community.   3. Nutrient additions caused changes in algal growth, which benefitted   tadpoles through increased mass, development and survival. Bd-exposed   tadpoles metamorphosed sooner than unexposed individuals, but their mass   at metamorphosis was not affected by Bd exposure. We detected additive   rather than interactive effects of nutrient supplementation and Bd in   this experiment.   4. Nutrient supplementation was not a significant predictor of infection   load of larval amphibians. However, a structural equation model revealed   that resource supplementation and exposure of amphibians to Bd altered   the structure of the aquatic community.

Predicting the spatial pattern of disease risk in wild animal   populations is important for implementing effective control programmes.   We developed a risk model predicting the probability that a deer   harvested in a wild population was chronic wasting disease positive   (CWD+) and evaluated the importance of landscape connectivity based on   deer movements.   2. We quantified landscape connectivity from deer `resistance' to move   across the landscape similar to the flow of electrical current across a   hypothetical electronic circuit. Resistance values to deer movement were   derived as the inverse of step selection function values constructed   using movement data from GPS-collared deer.   3. The top CWD risk model indicated risk increased over time was higher   among mule deer Odocoileus hetnionus than white-tailed deer Odocoileus   virginianus, males than females, and was greater in areas with high   stream density and abundant agriculture. A metric of connectivity   derived from mule deer movements outperformed models including Euclidean   distance, with high connectivity being associated with high CWD risk.   4. The CWD risk model was a good predictor of CWD occurrence among an   independent set of surveillance data collected in subsequent years.   5. Synthesis and applications. We found that landscape connectivity was   a major contributor to the spatial pattern of chronic wasting disease   (CWD) risk on a heterogeneous landscape. For this reason, future disease   surveillance programmes and models of disease spread should consider   landscape connectivity. In the aspen parkland ecosystem, we recommend   managers focus surveillance and control efforts along river valleys   surrounded by agriculture where mule deer abound, because of the high   risk of CWD infection.",931,NO,,BH,check,,,

Host-parasite interactions are fundamentally important   drivers of evolutionary processes, but a lack of understanding of the   genes involved in the host's response to chronic parasite insult makes   it particularly difficult to understand the mechanisms of host life   history trade-offs and the adaptive dynamics involved. Here, we examine   the genetic basis of gastrointestinal nematode (Trichostrongylus tenuis)   burden in 695 red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) individuals genotyped   at 384 genome-wide SNPs. We first use genome-wide association to   identify individual SNPs associated with nematode burden. We then   partition genome-wide heritability to identify chromosomes with greater   heritability than expected from gene content, due to harbouring a   multitude of additive SNPs with individually undetectable effects. We   identified five SNPs on five chromosomes that accounted for differences   of up to 556 worms per bird, but together explained at best 4.9\% of the   phenotypic variance. These SNPs were closely linked to genes   representing a range of physiological processes including the immune   system, protein degradation and energy metabolism. Genome partitioning   indicated genome-wide heritability of up to 29\% and three chromosomes   with excess heritability of up to 4.3\% (total 8.9\%). These results   implicate SNPs and novel genomic regions underlying nematode burden in   this system and suggest that this phenotype is somewhere between being   based on few large-effect genes (oligogenic) and based on a large number   of genes with small individual but large combined effects (polygenic).",932,NO,,BH,check,,,

We integrated valve daily rhythm dynamic patterns and water   chemistry-based Hill dose-response model to build into a programmatic   mechanism of inductance-based valvometry technique for providing a rapid   and cost-effective dynamic detection system.

We demonstrate that their assertions rely on circular reasoning   as well as logical and empirical assumptions that have not received   rigorous evaluation.   Welsh \& Hodgson (2008) based their arguments on data collected in   northwestern California, U.S.A. However, all three taxa occur across a   wide range of environmental gradients in the PNW, and other research   results suggest that the taxa respond differentially to environmental   perturbations across their geographical distribution. Hence, differences   in abundance are not always reliable indicators of the state of an   ecosystem, as population numbers can be influenced by factors that may   not be associated with habitat quality (e.g. predation and disease).   Welsh \& Hodgson (2008) present indices (rather than estimates) of   abundance, which contain an unquantifiable amount of uncertainty not   reliably attributable to either environmental or management factors.   Evaluating parameters such as reproductive success and survival are more   likely to provide strong inference about factors influencing population   size than correlative studies that associate some measure of relative   abundance with individual habitat features.   We argue that direct measurement of physical features (water   temperature, sediment and wood), for which Welsh \& Hodgson (2008)   suggest using amphibians as surrogates, is more accurate, efficient and   cost effective compared with monitoring cryptic species with methods   that are unable to quantify spatial and temporal uncertainty in   biological responses.   Headwater streams are critical components of catchments in the PNW, and   all three amphibian taxa show strong associations with low-order   streams. However, we think research and monitoring of headwater streams   should be guided by hypotheses that evaluate causal mechanisms, rather   than relying on descriptive patterns that are limited in geographical   scope and which support only weak inference about ecosystem processes.   Other studies provide direct links between physical features and   responses of target populations (i.e. fish). Adding a second correlative   link (i.e. amphibians) provides no added benefit, and increases   uncertainty in the association between management actions and changes in   population size.",934,NO,,BH,check,,,

Here we show, in simple   experimental soil bacterial communities containing a conjugative mercury   resistance plasmid, the repeated, independent mobilization of   transposon-borne genes from chromosome to plasmid, plasmid to chromosome   and, in the absence of mercury selection, interspecific gene transfers   from the chromosome of one species to the other via the plasmid. By   reducing conjugation, positive selection for plasmid-encoded traits,   like mercury resistance, can consequently inhibit HGT.

In this context, the attention of   public opinion, and hence conservationists' efforts, are often targeted   towards species having emotional, recreational and/or economical value.   This tendency may result in a high number of extinctions happening   unnoticed. Among these, many could involve parasites. Several studies   have highlighted various reasons why we should care about this, that go   far beyond the fact that parasites are amazingly diverse. A growing   corpus of evidence suggests that parasites contribute much to ecosystems   both in terms of biomass and services, and the seemingly paradoxical   idea that a healthy ecosystem is one rich in parasites is becoming key   to the whole concept of parasite conservation. Although various articles   have covered different aspects of host-parasite co-extinctions, I feel   that some important conceptual issues still need to be formally   addressed. In this review, I will attempt at clarifying some of them,   with the aim of providing researchers with a unifying conceptual   framework that could help them designing future studies. In doing this,   I will try to draw a more clear distinction between the   (co-)evolutionary and the ecological dimensions of co-extinction   studies, since the ongoing processes that are putting parasites at risk   now operate at a scale that is extremely different from the one that has   shaped host-parasite networks throughout million years of co-evolution.   Moreover, I will emphasize how the complexity of direct and indirect   effects of parasites on ecosystems makes it much challenging to identify   the mechanisms possibly leading to co-extinction events, and to predict   how such events will affect ecosystems in the long run.

In light of these results, it appears that elevated CO2 does   not have a negative influence on A. viridis that live naturally in the   site.

Many   parasitoid wasps display flexibility in choosing to host-feed or   oviposit on a host and possess an ovarian system enabling nutrient   reallocation through egg resorption.   The aim of this work is to assess the complementary adaptive values of   host-feeding and egg resorption as functions of host density in a   synovigenic (maturing eggs throughout its adult life) parasitoid,   Eupelmus vuilleti (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), for which there is a   uniquely large base of relevant knowledge. We developed a series of   models of increasing complexity, starting from a simple analytical model   without egg resorption and moving on to data-rich stochastic dynamic   programming models (SDP), without and with resorption.   The analytical model enabled the characterization of two, long-and   short-term, foraging strategies which determine host usage. Oviposition   is favored at low host densities (leading to the short-term strategy),   while host-feeding is favored at high host densities (leading to the   long-term strategy). The change of strategy occurs abruptly at   intermediate host densities. The SPD models not only confirmed these   predictions, but also identified smaller regions of decisions driven by   day/night cycles and approaching death and predicted major shifts in   daily activity patterns according to the chosen strategy. The fitness   gain due to resorption is highest at intermediate host densities, where   females adopt the riskier but more pro. table long-term strategy. Such a   result contrasts with the generally held view, which assumes highest   gains at the lowest host densities. A counterintuitive result is the   higher prevalence of host-feeding associated with the ability to resorb   eggs.   Considering egg resorption as a last-resort strategy is underestimating   its adaptive value, which is best understood with reference to other   sources of nutrients. Its deterministic and controllable nature acts as   insurance to forage and oviposit at low host densities, despite   irregular food availability and potential death through starvation. Thus   timing, not so much overall energy gain, matters in egg resorption. The   approach can be extended to other situations, and we highlight an   unexpected analogy of our results with the hoarding behavior of   vertebrates.",938,NO,,BH,check,,,

However, contrasting patterns have been recorded   across the tropics, and the role of disturbance in driving biomass and   stem dynamics has been highlighted as an alternative explanation.   Australian tropical forests have rarely been assessed in pan-tropical   analyses of long-term dynamics. We have measured recruitment, mortality   and growth in 20 permanent plots in tropical forest across north-eastern   Australia since 1971. We assess changes in plot level above-ground live   biomass (AGB) and stem density, and compare our results with those   documented over a similar time frame in the neo-tropics. No significant   increase in AGB was found over the 40-year time period. Above-ground   biomass tended to increase over the first two decades of the monitoring   period and decrease in the final two with gain terms (growth and   recruitment) lower than loss terms (mortality) by the final decade   (2000s). Stem density significantly decreased over the monitoring period   with recruitment consistently lower than mortality. There was large   variation in individual plots in their pattern of AGB and stem density   changes over time which was consistent with the response of each plot to   known disturbance events, including cyclones, pathogen outbreaks and   drought. Our results are in contrast to those described for neo-tropical   plots which appear to show a widespread pattern of increasing growth and   stem density.Synthesis. The trend towards increasing biomass and stem   density of tropical forests described for the neo-tropics does not   necessarily reflect patterns in areas of the tropics where large-scale   natural disturbances are relatively frequent.

Environmental   factors, such as mean site temperature and soil characteristics, play an   important role in the occurrence of the disease. The objective of the   present work was to model and forecast the effect of environment on the   severity of alder Phytophthora outbreaks, and to determine whether   recent climate change might explain the disease emergence. Two alder   sites networks in NE and SW France were surveyed to assess the crown   health of trees; the oomycete soil inoculum was also monitored in the NE   network. The main factors explaining the temporal annual variation in   alder crown decline or crown recovery were the mean previous winter and   previous summer temperatures. Both low winter temperatures and high   summer temperatures were unfavorable to the disease. Cold winters   promoted tree recovery because of poor survival of the pathogen, while   hot summer temperature limited the incidence of tree decline. An SIS   model explaining the dynamics of the P. alni-induced alder decline was   developed using the data of the NE site network and validated using the   SW site network. This model was then used to simulate the frequency of   declining alder over time with historical climate data. The last   40years' weather conditions have been generally favorable to the   establishment of the disease, indicating that others factors may be   implicated in its emergence. The model, however, showed that the climate   of SW France was much more favorable for the disease than that of the   Northeast, because it seldom limited the overwintering of the pathogen.   Depending on the European area, climate change could either enhance or   decrease the severity of the alder decline.",941,NO,,BH,check,,,

We evaluate the structure of parasitic links in an   extensive salt marsh food web, with a new model distinguishing parasitic   links from non-parasitic links among free-living species. The proposed   model is an extension of the niche model for food web structure,   motivated by the potential role of size (and related metabolic rates) in   structuring food webs. The proposed extension captures several   properties observed in the data, including patterns of clustering and   nestedness, better than does a random model. By relaxing specific   assumptions, we demonstrate that two essential elements of the proposed   model are the similarity of a parasite's hosts and the increasing degree   of parasite specialization, along a one-dimensional niche axis. Thus,   inverting one of the basic rules of the original model, the one   determining consumers' generality appears critical.

Understanding the   dynamics of such metabolic and energetic pathways and investments is   particularly challenging in the case of holometabolous insects due to   their strikingly different life stages. We show how whole life-cycle   energy and mass budgets can be achieved for holometabolic insects   through dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory, permitting the fate of   acquired and stored nutrients to be followed over a complete life-cycle.   We applied the DEB theory to model the whole life-cycle energetics of an   endoparasitic wasp, Venturia canescens (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae).   Data on embryo, larval, and pupal dry mass, imago longevity, and   fecundity were used for assessing the goodness of fit of the model. Our   model predicted the growth curves of the larval and pupal stages, the   number of eggs laid by the imago through time, and lifespan events, such   as the different developmental times of the parasitoid. The model   enabled us to distinguish and follow the energy invested in eggs through   income and capital reserves. The mechanisms leading to the double costs   of being small (a shorter life under starving conditions and fewer eggs)   were identified by running the model for varying amounts of food eaten   early in life, according to host sizes. The final larval instar harvests   around 60 times the energy of a recently hatched larva. Around 90\% of   this energy is then used during pupation to build the structure of the   imago and to pay maintenance. Imagoes, therefore, emerge with only a   small percentage of the energy stored by the last instar larvae. Our   study shows that, despite being small, this percentage of energy stored   during the parasitoid development has a great impact on adult fitness,   the loss of which cannot be compensated for by a rich adult environment.

Increasing demands resulting   from urban development and other human activities within coastal lake   catchments have the potential to result in their degradation and can   lead to conflicts, for example between lake users and upstream   communities. There are many techniques that can be used to integrate the   variables involved in such conflicts including system dynamics,   meta-modelling, and coupled component models, but many of these   techniques are too complex for catchment managers to employ on a routine   basis. The overall result is the potential to compromise the   sustainability of these important ecosystems. This paper describes   research to address this problem.

However, some observations of scavengers   avoiding feeding on carnivore carrion suggest that different types of   carrion may lead to differential pressures. Untested assumptions about   carrion produced at different trophic levels could therefore lead   ecologists to overlook important evolutionary processes and their   ecological consequences.   Our general goal was to investigate the use of mammalian carnivore   carrion by vertebrate scavengers. In particular, we aimed to test the   hypothesis that carnivore carcasses are avoided by other carnivores,   especially at the intraspecific level, most likely to reduce exposure to   parasitism.   We take a three-pronged approach to study this principle by: (i)   providing data from field experiments, (ii) carrying out evolutionary   simulations of carnivore scavenging strategies under risks of parasitic   infection, and (iii) conducting a literature-review to test two   predictions regarding parasite life-history strategies.   First, our field experiments showed that the mean number of species   observed feeding at carcasses and the percentage of consumed carrion   biomass were substantially higher at herbivore carcasses than at   carnivore carcasses. This occurred even though the number of scavenger   species visiting carcasses and the time needed by scavengers to detect   carcasses were similar between both types of carcasses. In addition, we   did not observe cannibalism. Second, our evolutionary simulations   demonstrated that a risk of parasite transmission leads to the evolution   of scavengers with generally low cannibalistic tendencies, and that the   emergence of cannibalism-avoidance behaviour depends strongly on   assumptions about parasitebased mortality rates. Third, our literature   review indicated that parasite species potentially able to follow a   carnivore-carnivore indirect cycle, as well as those transmitted via   meat consumption, are rare in our study system.   Our findings support the existence of a novel coevolutionary relation   between carnivores and their parasites, and suggest that carnivore and   herbivore carcasses play very different roles in food webs and   ecosystems.",946,NO,,BH,check,,,

In turn, effects of plant roots on biotic   and abiotic conditions in the soil, which result in so-called plant-soil   feedback can be heterogeneously distributed as well, but it is unknown   how this heterogeneity affects root distribution, nutrient uptake and   plant biomass production. Here, we investigate plant root distribution   patterns as influenced by spatial heterogeneity of plant-soil feedback   in soil and quantify consequences for plant nitrogen uptake and biomass   production. We conditioned soils by four grassland plant species to   obtain own' and foreign' soils that differed in biotic conditions   similar as is done by the first phase of plant-soil feedback   experiments. We used these conditioned soils to create heterogeneous   (one patch of own and three patches of foreign soils) or homogeneous   substrates where own and foreign soils were mixed. We also included   sterilized soil to study the effect of excluding soil biota, such as   pathogens, symbionts and decomposers. We supplied N-15 as tracer to   measure nutrient uptake. In nonsterile conditions, most plant species   produced more biomass in heterogeneous than in homogeneous soil. Root   biomass and N-15 uptake rates were higher in foreign than own soil   patches. These differences between heterogeneous and homogeneous soil   disappeared when soil was sterilized, suggesting that the effects in   nonsterilized soils were due to species-specific soil biota that had   responded to soil conditioning. We conclude that plants produce more   biomass when own and foreign soils are patchily distributed than when   mixed. We show that this enhanced productivity is due to nutrient uptake   being overall most efficient when own and foreign soils are spatially   separated. We propose that spatial heterogeneity of negative plant-soil   feedback in species diverse plant communities may provide a better   explanation of overyielding than assuming that plant-soil feedback   effects are diluted.",947,NO,,BH,check,,,

We investigate the extent to which factors such as water availability   and diffusional losses of QS signalling molecules (autoinducers) would   affect QS across colonies. Our results support that QS activation is   indeed a good indicator of diffusional limitation, as QS is enhanced   when diffusion of autoinducers signal decreases (either as a result of   water availability or loss by diffusion).   Using further experimental data, we explore heterogeneity of QS   activation of this bacterium (colonies do not become homogeneously   activated) when growing in this natural habitat. We extend our model to   test a hypothesis regarding the initial QS potential of the cells.

Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is an example   of a ``calcium-pumping'' species and has been suggested to promote   land snail diversity in woodland ecosystems. In this study, leaf tissue   calcium, O- and B-horizon soil calcium and land snail diversity were   compared for three common understory tree species: flowering dogwood,   American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). Using   a litter sieving technique, land snails were sampled underneath these   three focal tree species. Land snail density, species richness and   diversity were estimated for a total of 19 trees.

Although such   plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) are considered as important drivers of plant   community assembly, past PSF studies have mainly addressed plant biomass   production. However, plant performance is not only the production of   biomass but comprises a sequence of different life stages: from seed   germination over vegetative growth up to the production of a viable   progeny. Here, we assessed the effects of soil biotic communities that   were previously conditioned for 3years by a focal plant species   monoculture or species mixtures on key plant life stages from   germination and vegetative growth to flowering and the production of   viable seeds. We used three common grassland herb species that were   grown in a sterile substrate and inoculated with a sterile control soil   or with living soils. Living soils were conditioned either by the focal   species in monoculture or a four- or eight-species mixture that included   the focal species to represent a decrease in the target plants'   conspecific influence on the soil communities. We show that the effect   of soil biota changed from positive at the plants' juvenile life stages   to neutral or negative at the plants' adult life stages and ultimately   decreased plant fitness. A higher conspecific influence on the soil   communities pronounced the positive effects at the juvenile life stage   but also the negative effects at adult life stages. Further, we observed   direct soil biotic effects on flower production and plant fitness that   were not mediated by adult biomass production. This suggests that soil   biotic effects may alter plant resource allocation and even may have   transgenerational effects on plant fitness.Synthesis. We conclude that   there is no overarching effect of soil biota that remains consistent at   all the life stages of a plant.

We aimed to disentangle the importance of   direct effects of plant diversity (through changes in apparency and   resource availability) from indirect effects (mediated by host plant   quality and performance). To do this, we compared insect communities in   C. jacea transplants, whose growth was influenced by the surrounding   plant communities (and where direct and indirect effects can occur),   with potted C. jacea plants, which do not compete with the surrounding   plant community (and where only direct effects are possible). Tephritid   infestation rate and insect load, mainly of the dominant species   Chaetorellia jaceae, decreased with increasing plant species and   functional group richness. These effects were not seen in the potted   plants and are therefore likely to be mediated by changes in host plant   performance and quality. Parasitism rates, mainly of the abundant   chalcid wasps Eurytoma compressa and Pteromalus albipennis, increased   with plant species or functional group richness in both transplants and   potted plants, suggesting that direct effects of plant diversity are   most important.

Given that most managed   systems have higher primary productivity than adjacent natural systems,   theory suggests that bottom-up subsidized consumers are likely to spill   over from managed to natural habitats.

However, it is unknown whether there is indeed   asymmetrical spillover of consumers between managed and natural   habitats, and whether this is related to resource abundance or the   trophic specialization of the consumer. We used flight intercept traps   to measure spillover of generalist predators (Vespula wasps, Vespidae)   and more specialist predators (106 species of parasitoids, Ichneumonidae   and Braconidae) across habitat edges between native New Zealand forest   and exotic plantation forest over a summer season. We found net   spillover of both generalist and specialist predators from plantation to   native forest, and that this was greater for generalists.

In the last two decades, it has become clear that   to further understand multitrophic interactions, the barrier between the   belowground and aboveground domains has to be crossed. Belowground   organisms that are intimately associated with the roots of terrestrial   plants can influence the levels of primary and secondary chemistry and   biomass of aboveground plant parts. These changes, in turn, influence   the growth, development, and survival of aboveground insect herbivores.   The discovery that soil organisms, which are usually out of sight and   out of mind, can affect plant-herbivore interactions aboveground raised   the question if and how higher trophic level organisms, such as   carnivores, could be influenced. At present, the study of   above-belowground interactions is evolving from interactions between   organisms directly associated with the plant roots and shoots (e.g.,   root feeders - plant - foliar herbivores) to interactions involving   members of higher trophic levels (e.g., parasitoids), as well as   non-herbivorous organisms (e.g., decomposers, symbiotic plant   mutualists, and pollinators). This multitrophic approach linking above-   and belowground food webs aims at addressing interactions between   plants, herbivores, and carnivores in a more realistic community   setting.

(iii) Phenotypic plasticity allows the increase in density of a   prey phenotype that would otherwise be depressed - the density increases   because prey evolve lower susceptibility to predation. (iv)   Host-pathogen co-evolution can lead to stable (possibly Turing) pattern   formation of a phenotype's density in the adaptive space. (v) Phenotypic   co-evolution in model ecosystems can stabilize a potentially local   chaotic dynamics.",956,NO,,BH,check,,,

Global composition and   network analysis of the microbiota was performed in faecal samples from   nine patients with recurrent CDI. Analyses were performed before and   after duodenal donor faeces infusion, and during a follow-up of 10   weeks. The microbiota data were compared with that of the healthy   donors. All patients successfully recovered. Their intestinal microbiota   changed from a low-diversity diseased state, dominated by Proteobacteria   and Bacilli, to a more diverse ecosystem resembling that of healthy   donors, dominated by Bacteroidetes and Clostridium groups, including   butyrate-producing bacteria. We identified specific multi-species   networks and signature microbial groups that were either depleted or   restored as a result of the treatment. The changes persisted over time.   Comprehensive and deep analyses of the microbiota of patients before and   after treatment exposed a therapeutic reset from a diseased state   towards a healthy profile. The identification of microbial groups that   constitute a niche for C. difficile overgrowth, as well as those driving   the reinstallation of a healthy intestinal microbiota, could contribute   to the development of biomarkers predicting recurrence and treatment   outcome, identifying an optimal microbiota composition that could lead   to targeted treatment strategies.",957,NO,,BH,check,,,

In vertebrates, the coloration of the   integument is often viewed as a dynamic ornament, which in birds can be   apparent in the beak. King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) are   monomorphic seabirds that possess conspicuous yellow-orange (YO) and   ultraviolet (UV) beak spots that are used by both males and females in   mate choice. We studied the dynamicity of beak spot sexual traits, and   to what extent they reflected changes in individual condition in fasting   king penguins and in penguins treated with an anti-parasitic drug. We   also describe the maturation of this colorful ornament during the yearly   catastrophic moult. On a time-scale of days to weeks, beak spot   coloration changed in response to fasting and experimental changes in   parasite load. Beak spot UV brightness decreased over a 10-day fast in   breeding birds. For birds caught during courtship and held in captivity   YO chroma decreased after a 24-day fast. Birds that were treated with an   antiparasitic solution showed an increase in UV coloration after   parasite removal. Altogether, our results show that beak spot coloration   is a dynamic ornament that reflects multiple dimensions of changes in   individual condition in breeding-fasting penguins.",958,NO,,BH,check,,,

Even more dramatic   was the threefold increase, from low- to high-plant species richness, in   abundances of predatory and parasitoid arthropods relative to their   herbivorous prey.

Yet, how glucocorticoid levels are associated with reproductive   success or survival in a natural setting has received little empirical   attention so far. Here, we examined links between survival and levels of   glucocorticoid in a small, short-lived primate, the grey mouse lemur   (Microcebus murinus), using for the first time an indicator of long-term   stress load (hair cortisol concentration). Using a   capture-mark-recapture modelling approach, we assessed the effect of   stress on survival in a broad context (semi-annual rates), but also   under a specific period of high energetic demands during the   reproductive season. We further assessed the power of other commonly   used health indicators (body condition and parasitism) in predicting   survival outcomes relative to the effect of long-term stress.   Results: We found that high levels of hair cortisol were associated with   reduced survival probabilities both at the semi-annual scale and over   the reproductive season. Additionally, very good body condition   (measured as scaled mass index) was related to increased survival at the   semi-annual scale, but not during the breeding season. In contrast,   variation in parasitism failed to predict survival.   Conclusion: Altogether, our results indicate that long-term increased   glucocorticoid levels can be related to survival and hence population   dynamics, and suggest differential strength of selection acting on   glucocorticoids, body condition, and parasite infection.",960,NO,,BH,check,,,

Recent reviews summarized the   mechanisms by which invasive species alter entire ecosystems, but   quantitative assessments of these mechanisms are lacking for actual   assemblages to determine their relative importance, frequency and   patterns. We updated information on introduced vertebrates in the Tierra   del Fuego Archipelago (TDF) via an exhaustive literature review and new   data to evaluate ecosystem impact mechanisms and provide management   recommendations. To date, 24 exotic vertebrates have naturalized in TDF,   outnumbering natives nearly 2:1, with the North American beaver (Castor   canadensis) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) being the most widely   distributed species and also impacting the ecosystem through the   greatest number of mechanisms. Introduced vertebrates occupied most   parts of the archipelago with human-inhabited islands having greater   taxa richness. All exotics potentially altered ecosystems by one or more   mechanisms: 100\% food webs, 92\% invasional meltdown, 42\% habitat   modification, 38\% disease or parasite transmission, 21\% soil property   and disturbance regime changes. Impact to habitat structure was the main   clustering criterion for this assemblage. Within the species that   physically alter habitats, we found two sub-groups: 1) large herbivores   and 2) ``others'' including beavers and muskrats. Species that did not   alter habitat were divided further into those with predatory trophic   effects (carnivorous mammals and trout, sub-group 4) and the rest with   assorted impacts (sub-group 3). By establishing high quality information   on archipelago-wide assemblage, distribution, impacts and mechanisms for   exotic vertebrates, we recommend, based on ecological criteria,   prioritizing the management of sub-group 2. A secondary priority might   be given to the carnivores in sub-group 4, while species in sub-groups 1   and 3 are less urgent. As the first systematic survey of introduced   fauna on an archipelago-scale, we identified knowledge gaps, such as   population abundance and dynamics for specific species, which are needed   to orient future work, but the notable progress made to date is   highlighted.

Although   numerous recent studies have evaluated the importance of natural enemies   in this context, relatively few have examined how ecological success may   result from differences in the magnitude of interference competition   between communities in the native and introduced ranges of nonnative   species. Here we examine how native-range competitive environments may   relate to invasion success for two important invasive species, the red   imported. re ant ( Solenopsis invicta) and the Argentine ant (   Linepithema humile), in a region of native-range sympatry. At two study   sites in northern Argentina, we used stable-isotope analysis, a variety   of observational approaches, and two different reciprocal removal   experiments to test ( 1) whether S. invicta competes asymmetrically with   L. humile ( as suggested by the 20th century pattern of replacement in   the southeastern United States) and ( 2) the extent to which these two   species achieve behavioral and numerical dominance. Stable-isotope   analysis and activity surveys indicated that S. invicta and L. humile   are both omnivores and forage during broadly overlapping portions of the   diel cycle. Short-term removal experiments at baits revealed no   competitive asymmetry between S. invicta and L. humile. Longer-term   colony removal experiments illustrated that S. invicta and L. humile   experience an approximately equal competitive release upon removal of   the other. Our results indicate that neither S. invicta nor L. humile   achieves the same degree of behavioral or ecological dominance where   they co-occur in native populations as they do in areas where either is   common in their introduced range. These results strongly suggest that   interspecific competition is an important limiting factor for both S.   invicta and L. humile in South America.",962,NO,,BH,check,,,

Hence, developing   nations must establish the capacity to resolve their problems.   Additionally, policy-makers and donors need to obtain scientific input   on issues such as global change and ecosystem services. We propose that   for nations rich in biodiversity, ecosystem services derived from   bioprospecting, or drug discovery, could contribute to economic   development. In the case where unstudied samples are shipped abroad for   research, the chances of obtaining royalties are infinitesimally small.   Therefore developing nations will only realize benefits from   bioprospecting through in-country research on their own biodiversity.   Policy-makers and donors have failed to appreciate the value of this   approach. In order to provide an example of the inherent links between   conservation and sustainable economic development, we initiated a drug   discovery effort in Panama that emphasizes local benefit. As much of the   drug discovery process as possible is conducted in Panamanian   laboratories, providing jobs dependent on intact biodiversity and   enhancing local research and training. In short, research, plus the   spin-offs from research, provide immediate and long-lasting benefits to   Panama. The connection between conservation and development has been   highlighted in publicity about the project in Panama's urban media. This   provides a constructive alternative to the perception the among the   urban populace that economic development inevitably competes with   conservation. In summary, our program uses biodiversity to promote human   health as well as to support research capacity, economic development and   conservation within Panama.

We studied the growth and cover change   in four combinations of these Sphagnum species during two growing   seasons. Sphagnum height increment and production were affected   negatively by high temperature and high N addition.

High temperature depressed the   cover of the `wet' species, S. balticum and S. cuspidatum. Nitrogen   concentrations increased with high N addition.

Additionally, size-dependent changes in wood chemical traits   have been rarely examined, although these changes may represent an   important aspect of tree ontogeny. Owing to selection for pathogen   resistance and biomechanical stability, we predicted that saplings would   show higher lignin (L) and wood carbon (C-conv), and lower holocellulose   (H) concentrations, compared with conspecific large trees. To test these   expectations, we quantified H, L and C-conv in co-occurring Panamanian   tree species at the large tree vs. sapling size classes. We also   examined inter-and intraspecific patterns using multivariate and   phylogenetic analyses. In 15 of 16 species, sapling L concentration was   higher than that in conspecific large trees, and in all 16 species,   sapling H was lower than that in conspecific large trees. In 16 of 24   species, C-conv was higher in saplings than conspecific large trees. All   large-tree traits were unrelated to sapling values and were unrelated to   four life-history variables. Wood chemical traits did not show a   phylogenetic signal in saplings, instead showing similar values across   distantly related taxa; in large trees, only H showed a significant   phylogenetic signal. Size-dependent changes in wood chemistry show   consistent and predictable patterns, suggesting that ontogenetic changes   in wood chemical traits are an important aspect of tree functional   biology. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that at early   ontogenetic stages, trees are selected for greater L to defend against   cellulose-decaying pathogens, or possibly to confer biomechanical   stability.",965,NO,,BH,check,,,

This study provides the first   comprehensive assessment of signal costs for Photinus fireflies (   Coleoptera: Lampyridae), using controlled experiments to measure both   the energy and predation costs associated with their bioluminescent   courtship signals. We measured energy required to generate   bioluminescent flashes, using differential open-flow respirometry, and   found that flash signaling results in only a nominal increase in energy   expenditure above resting levels. These results suggest that the energy   required to generate bioluminescent flashes represents a minor component   of the total cost of firefly courtship. However, controlled field   experiments revealed that visually oriented predators imposed major   costs on firefly courtship signals, with higher signaling rates   significantly increasing the likelihood of predation.

Characterized by complex terrain, knobcone pine forests occur in small   patches interspersed with chaparral and mixed evergreen forests. Stands   displayed unimodal, bimodal, and diffuse age distributions with   predominant stand ages ranging from 42 yr to 70 yr, although trees   ranged from 17 yr to 98 yr old.

Understanding how these   processes affect ecosystems and their functioning, in particular in the   high-diversity ecosystems of the tropics, has become a key issue in   ecological research. In this chapter, our focus is on the   agriculture-forest landscapes of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, an island   widely known for its endemic yet still poorly known flora and fauna. The   rise of the region to one of the largest cacao producing areas in the   world is at the core of recent land-use change and intensification   processes. Covering plants (trees, rattan palms, herbs, bryophytes) and   several invertebrate (ants, dung beetles, cacao insect herbivores,   fruit-feeding butterflies, parasitic Hymenoptera, spiders) and   vertebrate groups (amphibians, birds, murids, reptiles), we give an   in-depth overview of the determinants of biodiversity in cacao   landscapes, including both management and landscape-scale variables into   our analyses. Results show that shaded agroforests host a rich community   of species. By adopting a large-scale study design we showed that   proximity of natural forest is a key predictor for species richness of   plants, invertebrates and vertebrates alike. Endemics and forest   specialists benefit most from indigenous shade tree cover and proximity   to natural forest. Importantly, several functionally important groups   such as insectivorous and seed-dispersing birds benefit from tall shade   trees, shade tree diversity and proximity to forest edge, while   parasitoid diversity is greatest close to natural forests. Available   data on the effects of landuse change in cacao landscape of Central   Sulawesi is increasing. Change in landscape configuration and management   practices are being clearly reflected in the composition of species   communities, with likely impacts on ecosystem services such as pest   control and pollination.

However, the   reciprocal aspect of this relationship, the influence of tree diversity   on the strengths of plant-soil feedbacks is unknown. We examined whether   tree diversity can affect plant-soil feedbacks of two common temperate   tree species, beech (Fagus sylvatica) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea).   Soils were collected from adjacent to beech and oak trees growing in a   manipulative tree diversity field experiment and used as inocula in a   greenhouse experiment to determine whether increasing tree diversity   could moderate the strengths of plant-soil feedbacks. We also compared   plant-soil feedback responses between Q. petraea and F. sylvatica to   test the hypothesis that stronger negative feedbacks contribute to the   relative rarity of Q. petraea. Negative plant-soil feedbacks on seedling   emergence were observed for both tree species. Emergence increased with   increasing distance of the soil inocula from established trees in the   field, but only for inocula taken from the low-diversity treatment   (monocultures) and irrespective of the inoculum source (i.e., from   conspecific vs. heterospecific trees). In contrast, tree diversity had   no influence on the biomass responses of seedlings for either tree   species. Quercus petraea seedlings experienced negative plant-soil   feedbacks in their biomass responses which cascaded up to higher trophic   levels, i.e., leaf pathogen infection. Fagus sylvatica biomass responses   suggested positive plant-soil feedbacks, supporting the hypothesis that   the abundance of this species is less limited by interactions with   natural enemies. Our results suggest that distance-dependent seedling   emergence in temperate forests may depend on the diversity of tree   communities and that plant-soil feedbacks may cascade up to higher   trophic levels and change with the life history stage of the seedlings   involved.

Isothiocyanates are also known to   provide an indirect defense by acting as host finding cues for   parasitoids of insect herbivores that attack crucifers. It has been   speculated that nitriles may provide a similar indirect defense.

Furthermore, we found that richness   and community composition of fungi are shaped primarily by abiotic   factors and to a lesser, though still significant extent, by floristic   composition. Along this mesotopographic gradient, environmental severity   is strongly correlated with richness in all fungal functional groups:   positively in saprotrophic, pathogenic and lichenised fungi, and   negatively in ectomycorrhizal and root endophytic fungi. Our results   suggest complex interactions amongst functional groups, possibly due to   nutrient limitation or competitive exclusion, with potential   implications on soil carbon stocks.

Despite much recent work   incorporating competition, predation, and mutualism into species   distribution models (SDMs), the focus has been confined to aboveground   macroscopic interactions. Biotic interactions between plants and soil   microbial communities are understudied as potentially important drivers   of plant distributions. Some soil bacteria promote plant growth by   cycling nutrients, while others are pathogenic; thus they have a high   potential for influencing plant occurrence. We investigated the   influence of soil bacterial clades on the distributions of bryophytes   and 12 vascular plant species in a high elevation talus-field ecosystem   in the Rocky Mountain Front Range, Colorado, USA. We used an   information-theoretic criterion (AICc) modeling approach to compare SDMs   with the following different sets of predictors: abiotic variables,   abiotic variables and other plant abundances, abiotic variables and soil   bacteria clade relative abundances, and a full model with abiotic   factors, plant abundances, and bacteria relative abundances. We   predicted that bacteria would influence plant distributions both   positively and negatively, and that these interactions would improve   prediction of plant species distributions. We found that inclusion of   either plant or bacteria biotic predictors generally improved the fit,   deviance explained, and predictive power of the SDMs, and for the   majority of the species, adding information on both other plants and   bacteria yielded the best model. Interactions between the modeled   species and biotic predictors were both positive and negative,   suggesting the presence of competition, parasitism, and facilitation.   While our results indicate that plant-plant co-occurrences are a   stronger driver of plant distributions than plant-bacteria   co-occurrences, they also show that bacteria can explain parts of plant   distributions that remain unexplained by abiotic and plant predictors.   Our results provide further support for including biotic factors in   SDMs, and suggest that belowground factors be considered as well.",973,MAYBE,,BH,check,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

The   aim of this study was to investigate the influence of host phenology on   mistletoe water relations and leaf gas exchange. Mistletoe Passovia   ovata parasitizing evergreen (Miconia albicans) hosts and P. ovata   parasitizing deciduous (Byrsonima verbascifolia) hosts were sampled in a   Neotropical savanna. Photosynthetic parameters, diurnal cycles of   stomatal conductance, pre-dawn and midday leaf water potential, and   stomatal anatomical traits were measured during the peak of the dry and   wet seasons, respectively. P. ovata showed distinct water-use strategies   that were dependent on host phenology. For P. ovata parasitizing the   deciduous host, water use efficiency (WUE; ratio of photosynthetic rate   to transpirational water loss) was 2-fold lower in the dry season than   in the wet season; in contrast, WUE was maintained at the same level   during the wet and dry seasons in P. ovata parasitizing the evergreen   host. Generally, mistletoe and host diurnal cycles of stomatal   conductance were linked, although there were clear differences in leaf   water potential, with mistletoe showing anisohydric behaviour and the   host showing isohydric behaviour. Compared to mistletoes attached to   evergreen hosts, those parasitizing deciduous hosts had a 1.4-fold lower   stomatal density and 1.2-fold wider stomata on both leaf surfaces,   suggesting that the latter suffered less intense drought stress. This is   the first study to show morphophysiological differences in the same   mistletoe species parasitizing hosts of different phenological groups.

Salivary proteins are used by blood-feeding   ectoparasites to prevent hemostasis in the host and maximize energy   intake. We investigated the influence of association with specific host   species on allele frequencies of salivary protein genes in Cimex   adjunctus, a generalist blood-feeding ectoparasite of bats in North   America.

We   observed more variation at both salivary protein genes among parasite   populations associated with different host species than among   populations from different spatial locations associated with the same   host species. The variation in salivary protein genes among populations   on different host species was also greater than expected under a neutral   scenario of genetic drift and gene flow.

Here we use a meta-analysis of 215 studies with 1526 experiments that   measured plant growth responses to additions or removals of soil   organisms to test how different soil trophic levels affect plant growth.   Consistent with the trophic cascade hypothesis, we found that herbivores   and plant pathogens (henceforth pests) decreased plant growth and that   predators of pests increased plant growth. The magnitude of this trophic   cascade was similar to that reported for aboveground systems. In   contrast, we did not find evidence for trophic cascades in decomposer-   and symbiont-based (henceforth mutualist) food chains. In these food   chains, mutualists increased plant growth and predators of mutualists   also increased plant growth, presumably by increasing nutrient cycling   rates. Therefore, mutualists, predators of mutualists and predators of   pests all increased plant growth. Further, experiments that added   multiple organisms from different trophic levels also increased plant   growth. As a result, across the dataset, soil organisms increased plant   growth 29\% and non-pest soil organisms increased plant growth 46\%.   Omnivory has traditionally been thought to confound soil trophic   dynamics, but here we suggest that omnivory allows for a simplified   perspective of soil food webs - one in which most soil organisms   increase plant growth by preying on pests or increasing nutrient cycling   rates.

The proliferation of livestock provides an abundant food   resource for this obligate blood-feeding species that could alter its   foraging behaviour and rabies transmission, but poor understanding of   the dietary plasticity of vampire bats limits understanding of how   livestock influences rabies risk. We analysed individual- and   population-level foraging behaviour by applying C-13 and N-15 stable   isotope analysis to hair samples from 183 vampire bats captured from   nine colonies in Peru. We also assessed the isotopic distributions of   realized prey by analysing blood meals extracted from engorged bats and   samples collected from potential prey species. In two adjacent but   contrasting areas of the Amazon with scarce and abundant livestock, we   used questionnaires to evaluate the incidence of feeding on humans.   Population-level isotopic signatures suggested substantial among-site   variation in feeding behaviour, including reliance on livestock in some   colonies and feeding on combinations of domestic and wild prey in   others. Isotopic heterogeneity within bat colonies was among the largest   recorded in vertebrate populations, indicating that individuals   consistently fed on distinct prey resources and across distinct trophic   levels. In some sites, isotopic values of realized prey spanned broad   ranges, suggesting that bats with intermediate isotopic values could   plausibly be dietary specialists rather than generalists. Bayesian   estimates of isotopic niche width varied up to ninefold among colonies   and were maximized where wildlife and livestock were present at low   levels, but declined with greater availability of livestock. In the   Amazon, the absence of livestock was associated with feeding on humans   and wildlife.Policy implications. We provide the first insights into the   foraging behaviour of vampire bats in habitats with common depredation   on humans and show how vampire bat foraging may respond to land-use   change.

Parasites are   ubiquitous and known to affect physiological functions of their hosts,   but only few studies have assessed the effects of parasites on isotope   composition of hosts. We measured the changes in two of the most   commonly used stable isotopes in food-web studies, nitrogen (i.e.   N-15:N-14 ratio; denoted as N-15) and carbon (C-13:C-12; C-13) in   Daphnia hosts exposed to infection by a parasitic micosporidian in the   laboratory. Isotopic signatures of hosts fed a standardised controlled   diet were compared with uninfected animals under conditions of high food   availability and under food limitation. Parasite infection led to   enriched N-15 and C-13 values that were associated with decreased growth   and decreased lipid content, indicating energy limitation comparable to   that in food-limited animals. However, enrichment in C-13 values was   apparent sooner in infected well-fed animals than in the food-limited   animals, suggesting strong parasite-induced effects on host   C-metabolism. By using experimental exposure to parasite infection and a   standardised diet, our study excluded the effects of changes in food   sources via parasite-induced altered habitat or feeding behaviour on   host isotope composition and demonstrated for the first time that   parasite infection directly alters the isotopic values of the host.

Location Twenty river networks in Galicia, north-western Spain.   Methods A maximum-entropy approach was implemented to model the species'   distribution. Geostatistical mixed models were used to analyse the   mussel's abundance in dendritic river networks. Predictor variables   included the abundance and biomass of host fish (biotic interactions)   and abiotic predictors for climate, geology and land-form.   Results MAXENT models of species distribution were improved by 4.5\% in   terms of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve   (AUC) by the inclusion of biotic interactions. Host-fish predictors   contributed 63\% of the Maxent model prediction of mussel presence. A   geostatistical mixed model explained 52\% of the variance in mussel   abundance when including all the mussel abundance sites in the study   area; abiotic predictors had no significance and salmonid biomass and   resident trout population density were the only significant biotic   predictors, together explaining 2.4\% of the variance. An autocovariate   representing biotic interactions between mussels and fish explained   11.7\% of the variance. Using only sites where migratory host fish were   present (n = 149), a mixed model explained more variance (78\%) and the   contribution from the autocovariate for parasite-host interactions was   about three times larger than for the model including all sites (n =   419).

Ungulate impacts on plant   communities have been considered mostly from an above-ground   perspective. However, understanding below-ground effects of these   invasive herbivores is critical as they may drive feedbacks to   above-ground ecosystem components.   We measured growth responses of seedlings of five common tree species in   a greenhouse experiment in soils collected from 26 plots fenced to   exclude invasive ungulates for at least 17years and from paired,   unfenced control plots. We then further investigated soil-mediated   effects of ungulates on one tree species, Melicytus ramiflorus, by   partitioning these effects into soil abiotic and biotic components, as   well as measuring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) root infection.   Biomass of seedlings of all five species was greater in soils from   within exclosures, although this was only significant for two species.   These soil-mediated effects were partially driven by changes in physical   and chemical soil properties; soil bulk densities were lower inside   exclosures than in controls.   Effects of invasive ungulates on seedling biomass of M.ramiflorus were   positively related to effects on per cent AMF root infection. The   biomass of M.ramiflorus seedlings was positively related to the AMF   infection of its roots, which in turn was related to greater organic   matter content and lower bulk density of soils from within exclosures.   Results for M.ramiflorus indicated that soil-mediated effects of   ungulates on seedling biomass were of abiotic origin, but were mediated   by the biotic soil component, that is, through effects on AMF.   Synthesis. Invasive herbivores may potentially impact on plant   performance and community structure not only directly but also   indirectly through influencing soil abiotic and biotic properties. Our   results show that shifts in plant-soil interactions and feedbacks   represent important but understudied pathways by which invasive   ungulates can have wide-ranging impacts on forest ecosystems. Future   studies should consider the importance of soil-mediated effects of   invasive ungulates relative to direct effects of herbivory.",985,NO,,BH,check,,,

The explicit and implicit aims of creating ecological focus areas   (EFAs) and implementing greening measures in European agro-ecosystems   include the promotion of regulatory ecosystem services (ES) to sustain   crop production in conventional cropping systems. However, the extent to   which these goals are achieved with current policy measures remains   poorly explored.   2. We measured insect-mediated pollination and natural pest control   service provisioning in 18 winter oilseed rape fields as a function of   the independent and interactive effects of local EFA establishment-sown   wildflower strips and hedgerows-and landscape-scale greening measures   within a 1 km radius around focal fields and quantified their   contribution to crop yield.   3. Insect pollination potential and pest predation increased on average   by 10\% and 13\%, respectively, when landscape-scale greening measures   share was increased from 6\% to 26\%. For pollination, the increase was   stronger in fields adjoining an EFA (14\%) than in fields without   adjacent EFA (7\%).   4. Agricultural management practices were the main drivers of crop   yield. Neither insect pollination potential or natural pest control   (pest predation and parasitism) nor adjacent EFAs and landscape-scale   greening significantly affected crop yield in addition to agricultural   management.   5. Synthesis and applications. Local establishment of perennial,   species-rich wildflower strips and hedgerows, combined with   landscape-scale greening measures in agricultural landscapes, can   promote multiple ecosystem services (ES) in conventional production   systems. Benefits may be maximized when local and landscape measures are   combined. However, enhanced pollination and natural pest regulation seem   to contribute relatively little to final crop yield compared to local   agricultural management practices in the high-input conventional   production system studied. Further research is needed to better   understand how to improve the effectiveness of ecological focus areas   and other greening measures in promoting regulatory ES.

The   presence of B. abortus within wildlife populations is an important   conservation issue because of the risk of brucellosis transmission from   wildlife to cattle.   2. We investigated conditions facilitating contact between bison   (40-60\% seroprevalence) and elk on a shared winter range in the Madison   headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park. We evaluated the effects   of snow pack, season, elk and bison population sizes, and wolf Canis   lupus predation risk on the degree of spatial overlap between bison and   elk from 1991 to 2006.   3. Sixty-eight per cent of 10 093 independent elk observations occurred   within the known bison wintering range, 29\% occurred within the   distribution of bison within the winter range at the time of sampling   and 14\% occurred within 100 m of bison. Spatial overlap between bison   and elk measured across these three spatial scales increased with week   of the season, snow pack, and on days when wolves were within the same   drainage area as elk, but decreased with cumulative levels of wolf   predation risk.   4. Wolves contributed to immediate, short-term responses by elk that   increased spatial overlap with bison, but longer-term responses to   wolves resulted in elk distributions that reduced spatial overlap with   bison. Spatial overlap increased through the winter and peaked when   late-term abortion events and parturition occurred for bison.   5. Synthesis and applications. Despite this high level of association,   elk exposure to B. abortus in the Madison headwaters (2-4\%) was similar   to those in free-ranging elk populations that do not intermingle with   bison (1-3\%), suggesting that B. abortus transmission from bison-to-elk   under natural conditions is rare. Our results suggest that risk-driven   elk behavioural responses to wolves are unlikely to have important   disease implications. Management of brucellosis in greater yellow stone   ecosystem elk populations should focus on reducing elk-to-elk   transmission risk and, wherever possible, curtailing practices that   increase elk density and group sizes during the potential abortion   period.",987,NO,,BH,check,,,

For example, her-bivory can induce plant   defenses that affect subsequent interactions with herbivores, pathogens,   mycorrhizae, and pollinators. Parasitic plants are present in most   ecosystems, and play important roles in structuring communities.   However, the effects of host herbivory on parasitic plants, and the   potential mechanisms underlying such effects, are not well known. We   conducted a greenhouse study to ask whether gypsy moth (Lymantria   dispar) damage, host cultivar, and their interaction affected preference   of the stem parasite dodder (Cuscuta spp.) on cranberry hosts (Vaccinium   macrocarpum). We then assessed the mechanisms that could underlie such   effects by measuring induced changes in phytohormones and secondary   compounds. We found that damage by gypsy moths delayed dodder attachment   by approximately 0.3 days when dodder stems were added 2 days after   damage, and reduced attachment by more than 50\% when dodder stems were   added 1 week after host plant damage. Gypsy moth damage significantly   increased jasmonic acid (JA) levels, total volatile emissions, and the   flavonol, quercetin aglycone, suggesting possible mechanisms underlying   variation in dodder ability to locate or attach to hosts. Dodder   preference also differed between cranberry cultivars, with the highest   attachment on the cultivar that had significantly lower levels of total   volatile emissions and total phenolic acids, suggesting that volatile   composition and phenolics may mediate dodder preference. Our results   indicate that herbivory can reduce subsequent attachment by a highly   damaging parasitic plant, demonstrating the potential importance of   early damage for shaping subsequent species interactions.",988,MAYBE,,BH,check,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

Greater understanding of how these structures affect   aquatic organisms is needed to ensure that decisions regarding their   construction and removal strike an appropriate balance between   components of human and ecosystem services. Within the basin of the   Laurentian Great Lakes, the effects that in-stream barriers (dams) used   to control the non-native, parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) on   the diversity of non-target fishes is a significant concern for fishery   managers. A previous study indicated that upstream changes in the   species richness of non-target fishes observed in 24 streams with a sea   lamprey barrier relative to paired reference streams (a measure of   effect size) was variable across the basin. We examined the degree to   which the variance in effect size could be attributed to imprecision in   the field sampling protocol used to estimate effect sizes, differences   in catchment-scale landscape attributes between barrier and reference   streams within pairs, and differences in landscape attributes at   different spatial scales among barrier streams. Simulation modeling and   analyses of repeated field measurements made for a subset of streams   demonstrated that a large variance in effect size is expected for the   field sampling design and that estimates of effect size measured for   individual barrier streams are imprecise. Regression models and   multi-model inference methods based on Akaike's Information Criterion   provided less support for hypotheses linking effect size to landscape   attributes. Mean effect size, adjusted for the influences of landscape   characteristics within and across stream pairs, provides the most   reliable and least biased estimate of the effect of sea lamprey barriers   on the richness of nontarget fish species. With the information   currently available, landscape characteristics of catchments cannot be   used to help decision makers anticipate effects sizes for candidate   streams being considered for future barrier construction. Our findings   will help fishery managers in the Laurentian Great Lakes make more   informed decisions regarding the use and placement of sea lamprey   barriers and achieve their objective of delivering an integrated pest   management plan for sea lamprey control that is environmentally and   economically sound and socially acceptable.",992,NO,,BH,check,,,
"Silvia D. Schrey, Anton Hartmann, Ruediger Hampp",2015,Rhizosphere Interactions,NA,293-310,293-310,NA,"Roots are important not only for water and nutrient supply of the plant,   but also to release a wide range of carbon compounds of low molecular   weight, such as sugars, amino, and organic acids. These can amount to   between 10\% and 20\% of total net fixed carbon but vary based on   species, nitrogen availability, and plant age. In addition, most land   plants form symbioses with soil fungi, which in addition cause a   considerable drain of photoassimilates. Direct (plant exudates) or   indirect (via symbiotic fungi) rhizodeposition of carbon forms the basis   for an environment rich in diversified microbiological populations. This   was first suggested by Hiltner in 1904.   The rhizosphere is now defined as a narrow zone of soil, which is   influenced by living roots. It forms a boundary layer between the root   and the bulk soil. Here large fluxes of solutes and water, as well as   compounds contained in the gas phase, exist. Consequently, physical soil   properties can vary considerably. Depending on the demands of the plant,   changes in the soil water potential can be high during the day/night   cycle. In comparison to bulk soil, the soil water potential can become   strongly negative during the day at high transpiration rates and less   negative at night because of vertical redistribution by the root system   (hydraulic lift). Special conditions also exist with regard to O-2 and   pH. Following high rates of respiration by both roots and   microorganisms, O-2 tension can be very low especially in wet soil where   water limits diffusion rates. Uptake of solutes is often accompanied by   the release of protons and organic acids, which affects the pH at the   root surface.   Microorganisms of the rhizosphere establish a functional diversity that   includes the decomposition of organic matter, nitrogen fixation,   conversion of inorganic forms of nitrogen, solubilization of phosphate,   transformation of sulfur and iron, production of siderophores   (iron-binding compounds), release of plant(phyto) hormones, as well as   of compounds, which are used for biotic control.   It is obvious that bacteria are an important part of the microorganisms   inhabiting this ecological niche. In comparison to bulk soil, the   abundance of rhizosphere bacteria is several magnitudes higher   (1010-1012 microbes per gram soil versus <10(8) in bulk soil), but still   about 100 times lower than under culture conditions. Bacteria can   solubilize nutrients from the mineral soil layer, but will also   sequester them. Consumption of bacteria by soil protozoa and nematodes   will then liberate nutrients, which in due course will become available   for plants.   Fungi form another important part of the rhizosphere. Most terrestrial   plants develop symbiotic structures (mycorrhiza) with soil-borne fungi,   creating another sphere, the mycorrhizosphere. In these interactions,   the fungal partner provides the plant with improved access to water and   soil nutrients because of more or less complex hyphal structures, which   emanate from the root surface and extend far into the soil. The plant,   in return, supplies carbohydrates for fungal growth and maintenance.   Because of leakage and the turnover of mycorrhizal structures, these are   another source for solutes released into the soil where they can be   accessed by other microorganisms.   In the following interactions of bacteria, fungi and plants, and,   finally those of plants with each other are addressed. With regard to   soil bacteria, a wide range of bacterial activities exist such as the   ``good'' ones (plant growth promotion, plant disease suppression,   nitrogen fixation) and the ``bad'' ones (plant pathogens), as well as   bioactive compounds of bacterial secondary metabolism, which cause the   respective effects. Plant-associated bacteria act as opportunistic human   pathogens. Fungi form another focus, here especially the bacterial   influence on symbiotic and plant pathogenic fungi. Finally, direct   (parasitic plants, plant competition) and indirect (by the help of   fungi) interactions of plants themselves are described.   The examples introduced below show that the contemporary knowledge about   organisms and interactions in the rhizosphere has increased recently,   mainly because of the many attempts to improve plant growth and fitness.   The intense use of metagenomics with soil samples continuously reveals   the enormous diversity of microorganisms living and thriving on   plant-derived exudates. Interestingly, most of these organisms are not   pathogenic in nature. This is understandable because they depend on the   continuous delivery of organic compounds by the plant. This could also   explain why so many rhizosphere bacteria produce toxins that mainly   affect plant pathogenic microorganisms or release compounds that are   plant-beneficial.   An investigation of the chemical interactions is, however, extremely   limited owing to the lack of suitable experimental procedures and of   set-ups that represent realistic conditions. Experimentally sound   studies can most easily be performed under sterile conditions using   cocultures of the respective organisms or exuded compounds. Three   partite systems (host plant + two microorganisms (e.g., pathogen +   antagonist)) become already very difficult to handle, and the step to   field studies is enormous. Many other organisms now interfere,   metabolically modifying the ``identified bioactive compounds'' to an   unknown extend. Further, owing to different binding properties of soil   particles and other soil chemical factors, the fate of any such compound   remains unclear. Thus, there is still a long way to go to broaden our   understanding of the processes and molecules involved in rhizosphere   interactions.",993,NO,,BH,check,,,

We further show that increasing   pABA supply to hosts infected with the resistant strain worsens disease   and changes the relationship between parasite burden and pathology. Our   experiments demonstrate that, even when there is profound top-down   regulation (immunity), bottom-up regulation of pathogen populations can   occur and that its importance may vary during an infection. The   identification of resources that can be experimentally controlled opens   up the opportunity to manipulate competitive interactions between   parasites and hence their evolution.",994,NO,,BH,check,,,

Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is a high-mortality pathology that   critically affects freshwater salmonid populations. Infection is caused   by the endoparasitic myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, which   exploits freshwater bryozoans as primary hosts. Incidence and severity   of PKD have recently increased, largely owing to rising water   temperatures linked to climate change, causing a decline in fish catches   and local extinctions in many river systems.   2. Here, building on a recently proposed local model of PKD   transmission, a spatially explicit metacommunity framework is developed   to study the spatial effects of the disease spread in idealised stream   networks. At the local community scale, the model accounts for   demographic and epidemiological dynamics of bryozoan and fish   populations. At the network scale, the model couples the dynamics of   each local community through hydrological transport of parasite spores   and fish movement. The model also explicitly accounts for heterogeneity   in habitat characteristics and hydrological conditions along a river   network.   3. Network effects are investigated by running simulation experiments on   synthetic river network replicas derived from Optimal Channel Networks,   spanning trees known to reproduce all the mutually connected topological   and metric features of real rivers.   4. Network connectivity can produce heterogeneous patterns of PKD   prevalence even when the underlying spatial distributions of fish and   bryozoans are homogeneous. Prevalence is generally higher at the   downstream sites: if fish mobility is neglected, the spatial   distribution of prevalence follows that of the upstream drainage area;   otherwise, prevalence patterns are correlated with the proximity to the   outlet. Downstream invasion speed of PKD is generally high, due to the   fast dynamics of hydrological spore transport. For the tested values,   effects of water temperature on prevalence heterogeneity are minor.   However, climate change may increase invasion speed in both downstream   and upstream directions. PKD can establish in bryozoanfree river   reaches, on the condition that the infection be sustained by upstream or   downstream hot-spots. These results further our understanding of the   drivers of fish distribution in riverine ecosystems and may provide the   basis for the development of intervention and management tools,   especially facing climate change.",995,NO,,BH,check,,,

Comparatively less is known about the potential   indirect effects of disease that likely alter community structure and   larger ecosystem function. Since 2006, white-nose syndrome (WNS) has   resulted in the loss of over 6 million hibernating bats in eastern North   America. Considerable evidence exists concerning niche partitioning in   sympatric bat species in this region, and the unprecedented, rapid   decline in multiple species following WNS may provide an opportunity to   observe a dramatic restructuring of the bat community.   Location We conducted our study at Fort Drum Army Installation in   Jefferson and Lewis counties, New York, USA, where WNS first impacted   extant bat species in winter 2007-2008.   Methods Acoustical monitoring during 2003-2011 allowed us to test the   hypothesis that spatial and temporal niche partitioning by bats was   relaxed post-WNS.   Results We detected nine bat species pre-and post-WNS. Activity for most   bat species declined post-WNS. Dramatic post-WNS declines in activity of   little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, MYLU), formerly the most abundant   bat species in the region, were associated with complex, often   species-specific responses by other species that generally favoured   increased spatial and temporal overlap with MYLU.   Main conclusions In addition to the obvious direct effects of disease on   bat populations and activity levels, our results provide evidence that   disease can have cascading indirect effects on community structure.

This study compared alternative pre-plant soil   management practices with respect to their effects on plant-parasitic   nematode populations, soil quality parameters and risk of nitrate   leaching. In fall of 2009 and 2010, a mature raspberry field was mowed   down and plowed, and replicate plots were randomly allocated to each of   six treatments: (1) a non-amendedcontrol, (2) fumigation with Basamido,   (3) fall seeded barley cover crop, (4) recommended rate (20 m(3) ha(-1))   and (5) historical ``biofumigant'' high rate (250 m(3) ha(-1)) of   spring incorporated poultry manure, and (6) spring incorporated compost   (250 m(3) ha(-1)). Raspberry cv Saanich was planted approximately one   month after incorporation of amendments. Composite soil samples were   taken from each plot at multiple times during two subsequent growing   seasons and analyzed for nematode populations and soil chemical and   physical properties. Primocane biomass was assessed at the end of each   of the first two growing seasons as an index of crop vigor. The high   poultry manure and compost treatments suppressed root-lesion nematode   populations nearly as well as fumigation over two growing seasons. These   treatments also improved soil bulk densities and aggregation relative to   control, cover crop and fumigation treatments, while compost addition   beneficially increased soil pH, CEC and Ca concentrations more than   manure. Primocane production in the manure and compost treatments was   greater than in the control and cover crop treatments, but less than in   the fumigated treatment. Substantial nitrate accumulation in soil   amended with the high rate of manure indicated that application of   sufficient manure to suppress parasitic nematodes would pose a   significant risk of nitrate leaching. In contrast, soil nitrate   accumulation was not significantly increased in the compost amended   plots. Overall, compost application reduced nematode populations,   improved crop growth and did not increase the risk of nitrate leaching   in the short term and may be a viable alternative to fumigation.

Due to the generally sub-lethal effects of   herbivory in terrestrial systems, trophic cascades manifest themselves   in the first instance in the fitness of individual plants, affecting   both their numerical and genetic contributions to the population.   We directly compare the indirect predator effects on growth and   reproductive output of individual Vicia faba plants mediated by the   presence of two aphid species: Acyrtosiphon pisum is characterised by a   boom and bust strategy whereby colonies grow fast and overexploit their   host plant individual while Megoura viciae appear to follow a more   prudent strategy that avoids over-exploitation and death of the host   plant. Plants in the field were infested with A. pisum, M. viciae or   both and half the plants were protected from predators.   Exposure to predators had a strong impact on the biomass of individual   plants and the strength of this effect differed significantly between   the different herbivore treatments. A. pisum had a greater direct impact   on plants and this was coupled with a significantly stronger indirect   predator effect on plant biomass. Although the direct impact of   predators was strongest on M. viciae, this was not transmitted to the   plant level, indicating that the predator-prey interactions strength is   not as important as the plant-herbivore link for the magnitude of the   indirect predator impact. At the individual plant level, the indirect   predator effect was purely due to consumptive effects on herbivore   densities with no evidence for increased herbivore dispersal in response   to presence of predators.   The nature of plant-herbivore interactions is the key to terrestrial   trophic cascade strength. The two herbivores that we compared were   similar in feeding mode and body size but differed their way how they   exploit host plants, which was the important trait explaining the   strength of the trophic cascade.",1001,NO,,BH,check,,,

Problematically, knowledge of viral infection efficiencies   and outcomes derives from few model systems that over-represent   efficient lytic infections and under-represent virus-host natural   diversity. Here we sought to understand infection efficiency regulation   in an emerging environmental Bacteroidetes-virus model system with   markedly different outcomes on two genetically and physiologically   nearly identical host strains. For this, we quantified bacterial virus   (phage) and host DNA, transcripts and phage particles throughout both   infections. While phage transcriptomes were similar, transcriptional   differences between hosts suggested host-derived regulation of infection   efficiency. Specifically, the alternative host overexpressed DNA   degradation genes and underexpressed translation genes, which seemingly   targeted phage DNA particle production, as experiments revealed they   were both significantly delayed (by >30 min) and reduced (by >50\%) in   the inefficient infection. This suggests phage failure to repress early   alternative host expression and stress response allowed the host to   respond against infection by delaying phage DNA replication and protein   translation. Given that this phage type is ubiquitous and abundant in   the global oceans and that variable viral infection efficiencies are   central to dynamic ecosystems, these data provide a critically needed   foundation for understanding and modeling viral infections in nature.",1002,NO,,BH,check,,,

Possible effects of vulture   declines include longer persistence of carcasses and increasing   abundance of and contact between facultative scavengers at these   carcasses. These changes could increase rates of transmission of   infectious diseases, with carcasses serving as hubs of infection. To   evaluate these possibilities, we conducted a series of observations and   experimental tests of the effects of vulture extirpation on   decomposition rates of livestock carcasses and mammalian scavengers in   Kenya. We examined whether the absence of vultures changed carcass   decomposition time, number of mammalian scavengers visiting carcasses,   time spent by mammals at carcasses, and potential for disease   transmission at carcasses (measured by changes in intraspecific contact   rates). In the absence of vultures, mean carcass decomposition rates   nearly tripled. Furthermore, the mean number of mammals at carcasses   increased 3-fold (from 1.5 to 4.4 individuals/carcass), and the average   time spent by mammals at carcasses increased almost 3-fold (from 55 min   to 143 min). There was a nearly 3-fold increase in the mean number of   contacts between mammalian scavengers at carcasses without vultures.   These results highlight the role of vultures in carcass decomposition   and level of contact among mammalian scavengers. In combination, our   findings lead us to hypothesize that changes in vulture abundance may   affect patterns of disease transmission among mammalian carnivores.",1003,NO,,BH,check,,,

In agroecosystems, weed diversity   and biomass are frequently assumed to be negatively related to crop   yield and biomass. However, positive effects of weed species (pollinator   and parasitoid attraction) and different resource acquisition strategies   may reduce the competitive character of weeds a potential that can be   exploited within land-sharing approaches (i.e., biodiversity   conservation and agriculture on the same site). This study aimed at   analyzing the relationships of weed diversity and biomass to crop yield   and biomass in coconut and banana fields within an irrigation farming   scheme established in former Caatinga seasonal dry forest ecosystems   around the Itaparica Reservoir, Pernambuco, Brazil. Within each of 21   selected crop fields, we collected weed diversity and biomass data in   the fields' center and edge along with general information on crop yield   and the use of fertilizers and other agrochemical inputs. We found no   evidence for a negative relationship of crop yield or biomass and weed   diversity. On the contrary, crop yield and weed alpha diversity were   significantly positively correlated (Shannon and Simpson indices,   evenness). In contrast, weed biomass showed a significant negative   correlation to crop yield. The use of organic fertilizer had a   significant positive effect on crop yield, whereas no impact of   herbicides or insecticides was detected. In addition, the field edge   provided habitat for more weed species than the field center. Overall,   our data show that in perennial tropical crop fields high yield is not   opposed to high weed diversity. Moreover, the data suggest that organic   farming in the area will likely not lead to yield losses. Nevertheless,   the related weed assemblages inhabited only a few typical species of the   native dry forest vegetation which makes their contribution to   biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale debatable.

The   nonmotile chlorobia can perform nitrogen and carbon fixation, using   sulfide as electron donors for anoxygenic photosynthesis. The consortium   can move due to the flagella present in the central beta-protobacterium.   Although Chl. chlorochromatii CaD3 is never found as free-living   bacteria in nature, previous transcriptomic and proteomic studies have   revealed that there are differential transcription patterns between the   symbiotic and free-living status of Chl. chlorocromatii CaD3 when grown   in laboratory conditions. The differences occur mainly in genes encoding   the enzymatic reactions involved in nitrogen and amino acid metabolism.   We performed a metabolic reconstruction of Chl. chlorochromatii CaD3 and   an in silico analysis of its amino acid metabolism using an elementary   flux modes approach (EFM). Our study suggests that in symbiosis, Chl.   chlorochromatii CaD3 is under limited nitrogen conditions where the   GS/GOGAT (glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthetase) pathway is actively   assimilating ammonia obtained via N-2 fixation. In contrast, when   free-living, Chl. chlorochromatii CaD3 is in a condition of nitrogen   excess and ammonia is assimilated by the alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH)   pathway. We postulate that `Chlorochromatium aggregatum' originated from   a parasitic interaction where the N2 fixation capacity of the chlorobia   would be enhanced by injection of 2-oxoglutarate from the   beta-proteobacterium via the periplasm. This consortium would have the   advantage of motility, which is fundamental to a phototrophic bacterium,   and the syntrophy of nitrogen and carbon sources.",1005,NO,,BH,check,,,

Bait-bucket introductions of invasive   crayfishes, fishes, earthworms, pathogens, and other organisms have   reduced biodiversity and altered ecosystem function and structure   throughout the United States, including the Mid-Atlantic region. In   2008, we conducted a telephone survey of bait shops and a mail survey of   anglers to obtain information on the trade and use of bait in Maryland,   a US state with many introduced bait species. Our telephone survey of   bait shops confirmed that this industry is a source of non-native and   invasive species in Maryland. Our survey documented at least six   non-native bait species for sale in the state. With the exception of a   few locally collected bait species, bait sold in Maryland originated   from sources outside of the state, and in some cases, outside the   Mid-Atlantic region. Results of our angler survey indicated that 64\% of   Maryland freshwater anglers, both resident and non-resident, used live   bait and that the release of unused live bait was quite common and   occurred statewide. The release of unused bait by anglers varied with   bait type. Anglers more readily released aquatic than terrestrial baits.   For example, 65 and 69\% of Maryland anglers using fishes and crayfishes   released their unused bait; whereas only 18 and 10\% of anglers released   their unused earthworms and grubs-mealworms-maggots, respectively. Our   surveys indicated that any non-native, potentially invasive species   imported into the state via the bait industry is likely to be released   by anglers into Maryland's aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Many of   these species have the potential to become established in the state.   These results illustrate the need for greater oversight of the bait   industry, development of consistent regulations on bait use, and a   region-wide education campaign aimed at changing anglers' behavior   regarding bait use and its disposal. We recommend specific management   actions that, if implemented, would greatly reduce further bait-bucket   introductions and provide protection against invasive bait species in   Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic region.",1006,NO,,BH,check,,,

Our results indicate that   ecosystem-disease research has remained consistently rare, comprising   less than 2\% of disease ecology publications. Existing studies from   terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, however, demonstrate that   parasites can strongly affect (1) biogeochemical cycles of water,   carbon, nutrients, and trace elements, (2) fluxes of biomass and energy,   and (3) temporal ecosystem dynamics including disturbance, succession,   and stability. Mechanistically, most studies have demonstrated   density-mediated indirect effects, rather than trait-mediated effects,   or direct effects of parasites, although whether this is representative   remains unclear. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of   applying traits-based approaches to predict when parasites are most   likely to exert ecosystem-level effects.

Small-scale (0.25 m(2)) hypoxia and anoxia were   experimentally generated on a sublittoral soft bottom in 24 m depth in   the Gulf of Trieste. This approach successfully simulates the seasonal   low dissolved oxygen (DO) events here and enabled studying the behaviour   and mortality of the hermit crab Paguristes eremita. The crabs exhibited   a sequence of predictable stress responses and ultimately mortality,   which was correlated with five oxygen thresholds. Among the crustaceans,   which are a sensitive group to oxygen depletion, P. eremita is   relatively tolerant. Initially, at mild hypoxia (2.0 to 1.0 ml l(-1)   DO), hermit crabs showed avoidance by moving onto better oxygenated,   elevated substrata. This was accompanied by a series of responses   including decreased locomotory activity, increased body movements and   extension from the shell. During a moribund phase at severe hypoxia (0.5   to 0.01 ml l(-1) DO), crabs were mostly immobile in overturned shells   and body movements decreased. Anoxia triggered emergence from the shell,   with a brief locomotion spurt of shell-less crabs. The activity pattern   of normally day-active crabs was altered during hypoxia and anoxia.   Atypical interspecific interactions occurred: the crab Pisidia longimana   increasingly aggregated on hermit crab shells, and a hermit crab used   the emerged infaunal sea urchin Schizaster canaliferus as an elevated   substrate. Response patterns varied somewhat according to shell size or   symbiont type (the sponge Suberites domuncula). Mortality occurred after   extended anoxia (similar to 1.5 d) and increased hydrogen sulphide   levels (H2S similar to 128 mu mol). The relative tolerance of crabs and   certain symbionts (e.g. the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica) - as   potential survivors and recolonizers of affected areas - may influence   and promote community recovery after oxygen crises.

We modelled the   distribution of the hosts and free-living larva as a complete assemblage   to assess whether a complex trophic system will lead to an overall   increase in parasite distribution with climate change, or whether   divergent environmental niches may promote an ecological mismatch. Using   an ensemble approach to climate modelling under two different carbon   emission scenarios, we show that whereas the overall trend is for an   increase in niche breadth for each species, mismatches arise in habitat   suitability of the free-living larva vs. the definitive and intermediate   hosts. By incorporating these projected mismatches into a combined   model, we project a shift in parasite distribution accounting for all   steps in the transmission cycle, and identify that overall habitat   suitability of the parasite will decline in the Great Plains and   southeastern USA, but will increase in the Boreal Forest ecoregion,   particularly in Alberta. These results have important implications for   wildlife conservation and management due to the known pathogenicity of   parelaphostrongylosis to alternate hosts including moose, caribou and   elk.

In   addition, 11 surface soil samples were also collected to fully cover the   area. Thus, 58 soil samples were examined for their physical and   chemical properties as well as the total and available Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn,   Cr, Ni, Fe, and As concentrations. Forty-one of these samples were   tested for the presence of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes,   Clostridium perfringens, total coliforms, Escherichia coli as indicator   of fecal coliforms, enterococci, and total number of bacteria.   The irregular depth distribution of key soil properties illustrates the   mixing of soil layers for a long time due to the burial practices. The   significant increase of total N in the burial depth points to N occluded   in soil micro-aggregates or to N in slowly decomposing organic   substances. With few exceptions, median total metal concentrations in   the cemetery soil showed similar values as those reported for the soils   of Athens basin.

However, the populations of these pathogens were not particularly high   and the total bacterial population in the soil samples was found within   the normal limits.   The performed soil survey suggests that within 11 years, the soil   ecosystem of the studied old cemetery reached a close to stability   situation.

Blister rust, a fungal pathogen, and   mountain pine beetle, an insect pest, are two dominant sources of stress   and mortality to high-altitude whitebark pine within the Greater   Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In whitebark pine populations infested with   blister rust or mountain pine beetle, the shift from green to red   needles at the outer-most branches is an early sign of stress and   infestation. In this analysis, we investigated a method that combines   field surveys with a remote sensing classification and spatial analysis   to differentiate the effects of these two agents of stress and mortality   within whitebark pine. Hyperspectral remotely sensed images from the   airborne HyMap sensor were classifled to determine the locations of   stress and mortality in whitebark pine crowns through sub-pixel   mixture-tuned matched-filter analysis in three areas of the GYE in   September 2000 and July 2006. Differences in the spatial pattern of   blister rust and mountain pine beetle infestation allowed us to separate   areas dominated by mountain pine beetle versus blister rust by examining   changes in the spatial scale of significant stress and mortality   clusters computed by the Ripley's K algorithm. At two field sites the   distance between clusters of whitebark pine stress and mortality   decreased from 2000 to 2006, indicating domination by the patchy spatial   pattern of blister rust infestation. At another site, the distance   between significant stress and mortality clusters increased from 2000 to   2006, indicating that the contiguous pattern of mountain pine beetle   infestation was the primary source of disturbance. Analysis of these   spatial stress and mortality patterns derived from remote sensing yields   insight to the relative importance of blister rust and mountain pine   beetle dynamics in the landscape.

Hemiparasites are   assumed to be weak competitors for light but strong parasites, leading   to the prediction that effects on hosts and communities should be a   function of resource supply. We investigated the effects of light and   mineral nutrients on hemiparasite-host relations in two experiments.   Removal of the hemiparasite, addition of fertilizer, and full sun   significantly increased total aboveground dry mass in small plots on a   restored tallgrass prairie. After 3 years, removal of Pedicularis   canadensis almost doubled the mass of grasses and had smaller effects on   forb species, but the impact of the parasite was independent of resource   level. Fertilizer increased grass growth only in full sun, increased   non-legume forb growth only when shade was applied, and tended to   depress legume growth when shaded. Light manipulation did not affect the   hemiparasite across 4 years of manipulation but fertilizer increased P.   canadensis shoot mass. A complementary greenhouse experiment with   Andropogon gerardii as host produced qualitatively similar effects and   showed that shade reduced root growth of both the host and the parasite.

Past studies have addressed biogeographic differences in abundance,   productivity, biomass, density and demography between plants in their   native and non-native ranges, but despite widespread observations of   biogeographic differences in impact these have been virtually untested.   In a comparison of three sites in each range, we found that the   abundance of Acroptilon repens in North America where it is invasive was   almost twice that in Uzbekistan where it is native. However, this   difference in abundance translated to far greater differences between   regions in the apparent impacts of Acroptilon on native species. The   biomass of native species in Acroptilon stands was 25-30 times lower in   the non-native range than in the native range. Experimental addition of   native species as seeds significantly increased the abundance of natives   at one North American site, but the proportion of native biomass even   with seed addition remained over an order of magnitude lower than that   of native species in Acroptilon stands in Uzbekistan. Experimental   disturbance had no long-term effect on Acroptilon abundance or impact in   North America, but Acroptilon increased slightly in abundance after   disturbance in Uzbekistan. In a long-term experiment in Uzbekistan,   suppression of invertebrate herbivores and pathogens did not result in   either consistent increases in Acroptilon biomass across years or   declines in the biomass of other native species, as one might expect if   the low impact of Acroptilon in the native range was due to its strong   top-down regulation by natural enemies. Our local scale measurements do   not represent all patterns of Acroptilon distribution and abundance that   might exist at the scale of landscapes in either range, but they do   suggest the possibility of fundamental biogeographic differences in the   way a highly successful invader interacts with other species,   differences that are not simply related to greater biomass or reduced   top-down regulation of the invader in its non-native range.",1019,MAYBE,,BH,check,MAYBE,effects of PP and non-PP not separable,

Climate-driven die-off is frequently compounded   with other drivers of tree mortality, such as altered land use,   wildfire, and invasive species, making forest management increasingly   complex. Facing similar challenges, rangeland managers have widely   adopted the approach of developing conceptual models that identify key   ecosystem states and major types of transitions between those states,   known as ``state-and-transition models'' (S\&T models). Using expert   opinion and available research, the development of such conceptual S\&T   models has proven useful in anticipating ecosystem changes and   identifying management actions to undertake or to avoid. In cases where   detailed data are available, S\&T models can be developed into   probabilistic predictions, but even where data are insufficient to   predict transition probabilities, conceptual S\&T models can provide   valuable insights for managing a given ecosystem and for comparing and   contrasting different ecosystem dynamics. We assembled a synthesis of 14   forest die-off case studies from around the globe, each with sufficient   information to infer impacts on forest dynamics and to inform management   options following a forest die-off event. For each, we developed a   conceptual S\&T model to identify alternative ecosystem states, pathways   of ecosystem change, and points where management interventions have   been, or may be, successful in arresting or reversing undesirable   changes. We found that our diverse set of mortality case studies fit   into three broad classes of ecosystem trajectories: (1) single-state   transition shifts, (2) ecological cascading responses and feedbacks, and   (3) complex dynamics where multiple interactions, mortality drivers, and   impacts create a range of possible state transition responses. We   integrate monitoring and management goals in a framework aimed to   facilitate development of conceptual S\&T models for other forest   die-off events. Our results highlight that although forest die-off   events across the globe encompass many different underlying drivers and   pathways of ecosystem change, there are commonalities in opportunities   for successful management intervention.",1021,NO,,BH,check,,,

As measuring biodiversity in its entirety is impractical, there is   a need for bioindicators. This study tested the hypothesis that   parasitoid Hymenoptera are potential bioindicators that provide a useful   means to assess the wider biodiversity of arthropod populations in   agro-ecosystems. There are a range of theoretical arguments to support   such a claim, including the high trophic position of these taxa within   the arthropod communities in which they occur, and the unique nature of   their biological relationships with the majority of terrestrial   arthropod groups.   2. A survey of 48 commercial farms was conducted and Generalized Linear   Models used to investigate relationships between six taxa-parasitoid   Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Araneae and plants (species   richness and sward height)-in agricultural grasslands. As well as   relationships between these groups, the relationship of each individual   group to the overall biodiversity of all other arthropod groups was   explored.   3. Both abundance (r2 = 0 center dot 58) and taxon richness (r2 = 0   center dot 54) of parasitoid Hymenoptera had stronger relationships with   overall arthropod taxon richness than any other arthropod group   investigated. Parasitoid abundance also had a positive relationship with   species richness of Coleoptera (r2 = 0 center dot 23) and Hemiptera (r2   = 0 center dot 47).   4. An historical data set demonstrated how the relationship between   parasitoid abundance and overall arthropod taxon richness changes over   the growing season. July, when the relationship was strongest, is   potentially the most useful time to sample.   5. For use in routine monitoring, it is important that an effort be made   to understand the seasonal influence on the relationship in the context   being studied. Equal sampling effort must be made for all sites being   compared and sites should be sampled as close together in the season as   is possible.   6. Synthesis and applications.

We report the outcomes of a meta-analysis of 100   pairwise comparisons of insect pest or pathogen damage to water-stressed   and control trees from 40 publications. The type of feeding substrate   for insects and fungi and the water stress severity emerged as the main   factors influencing the level of damage in water-stressed trees.   Overall, primary damaging agents living in wood caused significantly   lower damage to the water-stressed trees compared with the control,   whereas primary pests and pathogens living on foliage caused more damage   to water-stressed trees, in all cases irrespective of stress severity.   In contrast, damage by secondary agents increased with stress severity,   which was best estimated by the ratio between the predawn leaf water   potential in stressed trees and the xylem pressure inducing 50\% loss in   hydraulic conductance due to cavitation, a species-specific index of   drought tolerance. Insect and fungus feeding behaviour, affected tree   part, and water stress severity are therefore proposed as three   important predictors of forest damage in drought conditions.",1023,NO,,BH,check,,,

Parasites can be important determinants of host community structure   while host community structure can influence the success of parasites,   although both are often overlooked. In two laboratory experiments, we   examined interactions among Myxobolus cerebralis syn Myxosoma cerebralis   Hofer, the myxozoan parasite that causes salmonid whirling disease, and   two coexisting tubificid species: Tubifex tubifex ( Muller), which is   the alternate host of the parasite, and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri   Claparede, which is not susceptible. In the first experiment, we   examined T. tubifex infection prevalence when exposed to nine doses of   spores. In the second experiment, we examined tubificid and parasite   success under three spore doses when tubificids were combined in a   response surface experimental design used to detect interactions among   species.   2. The outcomes of interactions between tubificid species were complex.   The number and biomass of offspring of both tubificid species were   density dependent when in monoculture or in combination with the other   species. Adult growth of T. tubifex was also density dependent in   monoculture, but when L. hoffmeisteri replaced one-half of the T.   tubifex in the high-density treatment, adult growth of T. tubifex was   higher than in monoculture. Adult growth of L. hoffmeisteri was always   density independent. Whether T. tubifex was exposed to the parasite or   not did not change the outcome of these interactions. However, adult   growth of T. tubifex, but not L. hoffmeisteri, was highest when M.   cerebralis was present.   3. Infection prevalence of T. tubifex increased with increasing spore   dose.

The long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum was particularly effective at   controlling macroalgae and facilitating coral dominance on Caribbean   reefs until its ecological extinction from a catastrophic disease   epidemic in the early 1980s. Despite their important role in the   structure and functioning of Caribbean reef ecosystems, the natural   dynamics of Caribbean reef urchin communities are poorly known due to   the paucity of ecological survey data prior to large-scale human   disturbances and the Diadema dieoff. To help resolve the baseline   abundances and ecological roles of common urchin taxa, we track changes   in urchin abundance and composition over the past 3000 yr from analysis   of subfossil urchin spines preserved in reef matrix cores collected in   Caribbean Panama. Echinometra consistently dominated the subfossil spine   assemblage, while Diadema was consistently rare in the subfossil record   in this region. Rather than increasing during a period of heightened   human exploitation of their fish competitors and predators, Diadema   began declining over a millennium ago. Convergent cross mapping (CCM)   causality analyses reveal that Diadema abundance is causally related to   coral community composition. Diadema is negatively affected by Acropora   cervicornis dominance, likely due to the tight association between this   coral and the threespot damselfish, an effective Diadema competitor.   Conversely, Diadema positively affects the abundance of the coral   Madracis mirabilis, possibly via its control of macroalgae. Causal   relationships were not detected among abundances of individual urchin   taxa, indicating that inter-specific echinoid competition is not a   factor limiting Diadema recovery. Our detailed record of prehistorical   and historical urchin community dynamics suggests that the failure of   Diadema to recover over 30 yr after its mass mortality event may be due   in part to the prey release of damselfish following the long-term   overfishing of piscivorous fishes.",1028,NO,,BH,check,,,

Some of these effects may be mediated via their impact on   host energy budgets. This impact may include effects on both energy   intake and absorption as well as components of expenditure, including   resting metabolic rate (RMR) and activity (e.g. grooming). Despite their   potential importance, the energy costs of parasitism have seldom been   directly quantified in a field setting. Here we pharmacologically   treated female Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) with anti-parasite   drugs and measured the change in body composition, the daily energy   expenditure (DEE) using doubly labelled water, the RMR by respirometry   and the proportions of time spent looking for food, feeding, moving and   grooming. Post-treatment animals gained an average 19 g of fat or   approximately 25 kJ d(-1). DEE averaged 382 kJ d-1 prior to and 375 kJ   d-1 post treatment (p> 0.05).

A primary   impact of infection by parasites could be suppression of feeding   behaviour and, hence, total available energy resources. The significant   elevation of RMR after treatment was unexpected. One explanation might   be that parasites produce metabolic by-products that suppress RMR.   Overall, these findings suggest that impacts of parasites on host energy   budgets are complex and are not easily explained by simple effects such   as stimulation of a costly immune response.

Yet, little is known   about how different habitats influence the dynamics of multiple   herbivore species, and ultimately their collective impact on crop   production. Using cabbage as a model system, we examined how landscape   composition influenced the incidence of three specialist cruciferous   pests (aphids, flea beetles, and leaf-feeding Lepidoptera), lepidopteran   parasitoids, and crop yield across a gradient of landscape composition   in New York, USA. We expected that landscapes with a higher proportion   of cropland and lower habitat diversity would lead to an increase in   pest pressure of the specialist herbivores and a reduction in crop   yield. However, results indicated that neither greater cropland area nor   lower landscape diversity influenced pest pressure or yield. Rather,   pest pressure and yield were best explained by the presence of non-crop   habitats (i.e., meadows) in the landscape. Specifically, cabbage was   infested with fewer Lepidoptera in landscapes with a higher proportion   of meadows likely resulting from increased parasitism. Conversely,   cabbage was infested with more flea beetles and aphids as the proportion   of meadows in the landscape increased, suggesting that these pests   benefit from non-crop habitats. Furthermore, path analysis confirmed   that these landscape-mediated effects on pest populations can have   either positive or negative cascading effects on crop yield. Our   findings illustrate how different pest species within the same cropping   system show contrasting responses to landscape composition with respect   to both the direction and spatial scale of the relationship.

The aim of this work is to calculate the damage on human   health as a key factor for the evaluation of different wastewater   treatment processes. The damage due to emissions into both water and air   was taken into account. Indeed, the benefits related to the improved   effluent quality after treatment could be counteracted by the negative   effects when computing atmospheric emissions related to energy   requirement. While a set of specific cost factors was applied for air   pollution, a highly innovative perspective was adopted in the case of   water pollution: several biological assays were used to weight   waterborne diseases. Their application in the framework of a decision   making process represents a novel approach in the wastewater domain. In   short, we found that the economic equivalent of the impact on human   health is remarkably affected by the selected treatment train, ranging   from approximate to 2 (sic)/PE/y for advanced systems up to approximate   to 3 (sic)/PE/y for conventional activated sludge plants. In particular,   the most advisable schemes consist of an activated sludge plant   integrated with either i) activated carbon and sand filtration or ii)   sand filtration and ozonation. Finally, the applicability of the   proposed procedure is also discussed and compared with the conventional   life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, and the main difference is pointed   out: for the former, biological assays and related diseases are used for   endpoint calculation while the latter is based on the effect of each   single compound.

However, the effects of changes in   beneficial endosymbionts in plants are poorly known (except for   mycorrhizal and rhizobial associations). We sampled and compared   endophytes from hundreds of trees belonging to the economically   important genus Hevea, the source of natural rubber, in their native   range in the Amazon basin and in plantations. We also conducted   antagonism tests to determine the potential effects that some of these   endophytes may have on selected plant pathogenic fungi. The natural and   indigenous endosymbiotic mycota of the rubber tree (Hevea) contains a   high diversity of beneficial fungi that may protect against pathogens   (protective mutualism). In contrast, plantation trees have a reduced and   different diversity of these beneficial fungi. We propose that   abundance, and not just presence, of competitive fungal strains and   species (i.e., Trichoderma and Tolypocladium) create a protective effect   against pathogens in wild trees. This study provides support for the   importance of mutualistic endosymbionts in plant health and ecosystem   resilience, and calls for awareness of their potential loss by   human-related activities.

Viral abundance (VA, range = 0.9 to 3.5 x   10(10) l(-1)), bacterial abundance (BA), and the frequency of infected   cells were significantly higher in the oxic than in the anoxic waters,   which was partly related to forcing from the thermal stratification   together with vertical changes in dissolved oxygen, ammonia and   phytoplankton biomass. BA was the best predictor (R 2 = 0.78) for VA in   the oxygenated waters only. The virus-to-bacteria ratio (VBR) yielded   less variability and did not differ significantly along the water column   (mean +/- SD value = 5.5 +/- 1.3).

Paradoxically, the frequency of   visibly infected bacterial cells (determined from transmission electron   microscopy) in the sediments was significantly lower (on average 3- to   7-fold) compared with the water column, which is in agreement with   recent benthic reports in geographically contrasting lake environments.   On average, viruses destroyed 23\% of bacterial production in the   oxygenated surface waters, but only 9\% in deep anoxic waters and 3\% in   the sediments.

This pervasive mechanism occurs in a   variety of forms and ecosystems, but research to date has been heavily   skewed toward tree seedling survival in tropical forests. To evaluate   CNDD more broadly, we investigated how sapling growth rates were   affected by conspecific adult neighbors in a fully mapped 25.6 ha   temperate deciduous forest. We examined growth rates as a function of   the local adult tree neighborhood (via spatial autoregressive modeling)   and compared the spatial positioning of faster-growing and   slower-growing saplings with respect to adult conspecific and   heterospecific trees (via bivariate point pattern analysis). In   addition, to determine whether CNDD-driven variation in growth rates   leaves a corresponding spatial signal, we extended our point pattern   analysis to a static, growth-independent comparison of saplings and the   next larger size class. We found that negative conspecific effects on   sapling growth were most prevalent. Five of the nine species that were   sufficiently abundant for analysis exhibited CNDD, while only one   species showed evidence of a positive conspecific effect, and one or two   species, depending on the analysis, displayed heterospecific effects.   There was general agreement between the autoregressive models and the   point pattern analyses based on sapling growth rates, but point pattern   analyses based on single-point-in-time size classes yielded results that   differed markedly from the other two approaches. Our work adds to the   growing body of evidence that CNDD is an important force in temperate   forests, and demonstrates that this process extends to sapling growth   rates. Further, our findings indicate that point pattern analyses based   solely on size classes may fail to detect the process of interest (e.g.,   neighborhood-driven variation in growth rates), in part due to the   confounding of tree size and age.",1035,NO,,BH,check,,,

Do more complex ecosystems lead to significantly different evolutionary   behaviour and new potential extinctions?   Mathematical method: Merging host-parasite models with predator-prey   models. Analytically studying evolution using adaptive dynamics and   trade-off and invasion plots, and carrying out numerical simulations.   Key assumptions: Mass action (general mixing).

In simulations, very small (negligible)   populations are at risk of extinction.   Conclusions: The presence of the predator can significantly change   evolutionary outcomes for host resistance to a pathogen and can create   branching points where none occurred previously. The pathogen (and   sometimes the predator) is protected from exclusion if we take mutations   to be arbitrarily small; however, relaxing the assumption on mutation   size can lead to its exclusion. Increased resistance can drive the   predator and/or pathogen to extinction depending on inter-species   dynamics, such as the predator's preference for infected prey.

One such   mechanism is male killing (MK), in which sons of infected mothers are   killed by the endosymbiont during development. Several hypotheses have   been proposed to explain the advantages of MK, including resource   reallocation from sons to daughters of infected females, avoidance of   inbreeding by infected females, and, if transmission is not purely   maternal, the facilitation of horizontal transmission to uninfected   females. We tested these hypotheses in Drosophila innubila, a   mycophagous species infected with MK Wolbachia. There was no evidence of   horizontal transmission in the wild and no evidence Wolbachia reduced   levels of inbreeding. Resource reallocation does appear to be operative,   as Wolbachia-infected females are slightly larger, on average, than   uninfected females, although the selective advantage of larger size is   insufficient to account for the frequency of infection in natural   populations. Wolbachia-infected females from the wildalthough not those   from the laboratorywere more fecund than uninfected females.   Experimental studies revealed that Wolbachia can boost the fecundity of   nutrient-deprived flies and reduce the adverse effect of RNA virus   infection.

Here, we provide a case study using   time-series data to reconstruct patterns of change, and field   experiments to test for causality. We show how, over a 50-year period, a   series of unrelated human-induced changes created highly favorable   conditions for the non-native tree mallow (Lavatera arborea) to turn   invasive, causing loss of native vegetation and seabird breeding   habitat. The combination of three drivers: human-introduced disease,   climate warming and a fisheries-mediated increase in seabird   populations, removed major constraints on plant population growth, (i.e.   grazer control, climatic control, germination opportunity and nutrient   limitation). Collectively, these changes created optimal conditions for   the rapid expansion of tree mallow. The resulting dramatic impact on   both the native vegetation and breeding seabirds, notably puffins   (Fratercula arctica), exemplifies how non-native invasive plant species   can transform terrestrial ecosystems.

Our objective was to determine how tree species and   soils influence variation in antibiotic-mediated pathogen suppression   among Streptomyces communities in two tropical dry forest sites (Santa   Rosa and Palo Verde). We targeted tree species that co-occur in both   sites and used a culture-based functional assay to quantify   pathogen-suppressive capacities of Streptomyces communities beneath 50   focal trees. We also measured host-associated litter and soil element   concentrations as potential mechanisms by which trees may influence soil   microbes. Pathogen-suppressive capacities of Streptomyces communities   varied within and among tree species, and inhibitory phenotypes were   significantly related to soil and litter element concentrations. Average   proportions of inhibitory Streptomyces in soils from the same tree   species varied between 1.6 and 3.3-fold between sites. Densities and   proportions of pathogen-suppressive bacteria were always higher in Santa   Rosa than Palo Verde.

Ca.

Combining high-resolution   airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR, we studied hemiparasite   incidence within and among tree host stands to examine the prevalence   and spatial distribution of hemiparasite load in ecosystems.   Specifically, we aimed to assess: (1) detection accuracy of mistletoes   on their oak hosts; (2) hemiparasitism prevalence within host tree   canopies depending on tree height, and (3) spatial variation in   hemiparasitism across fragmented woodlands, in a low-diversity   mediterranean oak woodland in California, USA. We identified mistletoe   infestations with 55-96\% accuracy, and detected significant differences   in remote-sensed spectra between oak trees with and without mistletoe   infestation. We also found that host canopy height had little influence   on infestation degree, whereas landscape-level variation showed   consistent, non-random patterns: isolated host trees had twice the   infestation load than did trees located at the core of forest fragments.   Overall, we found that canopy exposure (i.e., lower canopy density or   proximity to forest edge) is more important than canopy height for   mistletoe infestation, and that by changing landscape structure,   parasitic prevalence increased with woodland fragmentation. We conclude   that reducing fragmentation in oak woodlands will minimize anthropogenic   impact on mistletoe infestation at the landscape level.

This study aims to detect pre-visual or green attack damage in lodgepole   pine needles by means of hyperspectral measurements, particularly via   continuous wavelet analysis. Field measurements of lodgepole pine stands   were conducted at two sites located northwest of Edmonton, Alberta,   Canada. In June and August of 2007, reflectance spectra (350-2500 nm)   were collected for 16 pairs of trees. Each of the 16 tree pairs included   one control tree (healthy), and one stressed tree (girdled to simulate   the effects of beetle infestation). In addition, during the period of   June through October 2008, spectra were collected from 15 pairs of   control- and beetle-infested trees. Spectra derived from these 31 tree   pairs were subjected to a continuous wavelet transform, generating a   scalogram that compiles the wavelet power as a function of wavelength   location and scale of decomposition. Linear relationships were then   explored between the wavelet scalograms and chemical properties or class   labels (control and non-control) of the sample populations in order to   isolate the most useful distinguishing spectral features that related to   infested or girdled trees vs. control trees.   A deficit in water content is observed in infested trees while an   additional deficit in chlorophyll content is seen for girdled trees. The   measurable water deficit of infested and girdled tree samples was   detectable from the wavelet analysis of the reflectance spectra   providing a novel method for the detection of green attack. The spectral   features distinguishing control and infested trees are predominantly   located between 950 and 1390 nm from scales 1 to 8. Of those, five   features between 1318 to 1322 nm at scale 7 are consistently found in   the July and August 2008 datasets. These features are located at longer   wavelengths than those investigated in previous studies (below 1100 nm)   and provide new insights into the potential remote detection of green   attack. Spectral features that distinguish control and girdled trees   were mostly observed between 1550 and 2370 nm from scales 1 to 5. The   differing response of girdled and infested trees appears to indicate   that the girdling process does not provide a perfect simulation of the   effects caused by beetle infestation.   It remains to be determined if the location of the 1318-1322 nm   features, near the edge of a strong atmospheric water absorption band,   will be sufficiently separable for use in airborne detection of green   attack. A plot comparing needle water content and wavelet power at 1320   nm reveals considerable overlap between data derived from both infested   and control samples, though the groups are statistically separable. This   obstacle may preclude a high accuracy separation of healthy and infected   single individuals, but establishing threshold identification levels may   provide an economical, efficient and expeditious method for   discriminating between healthy and infested tree populations.

Pearse",2014,"Spring Migration Ecology of the Mid-Continent Sandhill Crane Population   with an Emphasis on Use of the Central Platte River Valley, Nebraska",WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS,1-41,1-41,10.1002/wmon.1013,"We conducted a 10-year study (1998-2007) of the Mid-Continent Population   (MCP) of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) to identify spring-migration   corridors, locations of major stopovers, and migration chronology by   crane breeding affiliation (western Alaska-Siberia [WA-S], northern   Canada-Nunavut [NC-N], west-central Canada-Alaska [WC-A], and   east-central Canada-Minnesota [EC-M]). In the Central Platte River   Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska, we evaluated factors influencing staging   chronology, food habits, fat storage, and habitat use of sandhill   cranes. We compared our findings to results from the Platte River   Ecology Study conducted during 1978-1980. We determined spring migration   corridors used by the breeding affiliations (designated subpopulations   for management purposes) by monitoring 169 cranes marked with platform   transmitter terminals (PTTs). We also marked and monitored 456 cranes in   the CPRV with very high frequency (VHF) transmitters to evaluate length   and pattern of stay, habitat use, and movements. An estimated 42\% and   58\% of cranes staging in the CPRV were greater sandhill cranes (G. c.   tabida) and lesser sandhill cranes (G. c. canadensis), and they stayed   for an average of 20 and 25 days (2000-2007), respectively. Cranes from   the WA-S, NC-N, WC-A, and EC-M affiliations spent an average of 72, 77,   52, and 53 days, respectively, in spring migration of which 28, 23, 24,   and 18 days occurred in the CPRV. The majority of the WA-S subpopulation   settled in the CPRV apparently because of inadequate habitat to support   more birds upstream, although WA-S cranes accounted for >90\% of birds   staging in the North Platte River Valley. Crane staging duration in the   CPRV was negatively correlated with arrival dates; 92\% of cranes stayed   >7 days. A program of annual mechanical removal of mature stands of   woody growth and seedlings that began in the early 1980s primarily in   the main channel of the Platte River has allowed distribution of crane   roosts to remain relatively stable over the past 2 decades. Most cranes   returned to nocturnal roost sites used in previous years. Corn residues   dominated the diet of sandhill cranes in the CPRV, as in the 1970s,   despite a marked decline in standing crop of corn residues. Only 14\%   (10 of 74) of PTT-marked migrant cranes stayed at stopovers for >= 5   days before arriving in the CPRV, which limited the contribution of   sites south of the CPRV for fat accumulation needed for migration and   reproduction. Body masses of cranes (after adjusting for body size [an   index of fat]) at arrival in the CPRV varied widely among years   (1998-2006), indicating the importance of maintaining productive   habitats on the wintering grounds to condition cranes for migration and   reproduction. Average rates of fat gain by adult females while in the   CPRV remained similar from 1978-1979 to 1998-1999 but declined among   males. Distances cranes flew to feeding grounds in the CPRV increased as   the percentage of cropland planted to soybeans increased and as density   of cranes on nocturnal roosts increased. These results suggest that as   habitats of limited or no value to cranes increase on the landscape,   more flight time and higher maintenance costs may reduce fat storage. An   estimated 40\% of diurnal use occurred north of Interstate 80 (I-80)   where <= 5\% of lands dedicated to crane conservation are located.   Seventy-four and 40\% of PTT-marked EC-M and WC-A cranes had spring   migrations that included staging in eastern South Dakota for an average   of 11 and 10 days, respectively.   Cranes of the NC-N, WA-S, and WC-A subpopulations staged an average of   25, 17, and 12 days in central and western Saskatchewan/eastern Alberta.   Females in these affiliations increased their fat reserves after leaving   Nebraska by an estimated 450, 451, and 452 g, respectively, underscoring   the key role of these staging areas in preparing the 3 subpopulations   for reproduction. After departing Nebraska, MCP cranes roosted primarily   in basin wetlands. Most of these wetlands are in private ownership and   lack adequate protection, emphasizing the need for effective laws and   policies to ensure their long-term protection. The continued success of   the current management goal of maintaining the MCP at approximately its   current size and providing diverse recreational opportunities over a   wide area of midcontinent and western North America is predicated on the   ability of MCP cranes to continue to store large fat reserves in the   CPRV in advance of breeding. For the CPRV to remain a key fat storage   site, active channel maintenance (e. g., clearing of woody vegetation)   likely will need to continue, along with establishing minimum stream   flows. These actions would help ensure nocturnal roosting habitat   remains sufficiently dispersed to provide cranes with daily intake of   high-energy food adequate for major fat storage and limit risk of high   mortality from storms and disease.

In this study, we adopt a stochastic modeling   approach to address multiple pathways by which climate can constrain the   range of the generalist plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi (Pc):   through changing winter soil temperatures affecting pathogen survival;   spring soil temperatures and thus pathogen metabolic rates; and changing   spring soil moisture conditions and thus pathogen growth rates through   host root systems. We apply this model to the southwestern USA for   contemporary and plausible future climate scenarios and evaluate the   changes in the potential range of Pc. The results indicate that the   plausible range of this pathogen in the southwestern USA extends over   approximately 200000km(2) under contemporary conditions. While warming   temperatures as projected by the IPCC A2 and B1 emissions scenarios   greatly expand the range over which the pathogen can survive winter,   projected reductions in spring rainfall reduce its feasible habitat,   leading to spatially complex patterns of changing risk. The study   demonstrates that temperature and rainfall changes associated with   possible climate futures in the southwestern USA have confounding   impacts on the range of Pc, suggesting that projections of future   pathogen dynamics and ranges should account for multiple pathways of   climate-pathogen interaction.",1049,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Therefore, it is   urgent to find alternatives that are more environmentally friendly than   chemical fertilizers and pesticides for disease control. The key to   achieve successful biological control strategies is the knowledge of the   ecological interactions that occur belowground. The rhizosphere   constitutes a very dynamic environment harbouring the plant roots and   many organisms. Plants communicate and interact with those organisms   through the production and release of a large variety of secondary   metabolites into the rhizosphere. Thus, they use these metabolites to   defend themselves against soil-borne pathogens, which can adversely   affect plant growth and fitness, but also to establish mutualistic   associations with beneficial soil microorganisms. However, despite the   importance of these plant-organism interactions the mechanisms   regulating them remain largely unknown.   We review here chemical communication that takes place in the   rhizosphere between plants and other soil organisms, and the potential   use of this molecular dialogue for developing new biological control   strategies against deleterious organisms. We focus on the knowledge of   the root parasitic weed germination stimulants - strigolactones - to   develop more efficient control methods against this pest. Finally, we   illustrate this with an exciting example: the use of the mutualistic   arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis for controlling root parasitic weeds by   reducing the production of stiigolactones in the host plant.",1050,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

In   addition, identity effects, caused by the presence of particular species   in a community, may also drive biodiversity and ecosystem functioning   relationships, with ``selection'' or ``sampling effects'' being   particularly important. We tested the effect of tree species richness   and tree species identity effects on foliar fungal pathogens on four   forest tree species of the temperate zone making use of the BIOTREE tree   diversity experiment in Germany. We hypothesized that fungal species   richness is positively and fungal pathogen load negatively related to   tree species richness. In addition, we tested whether species number of   foliar biotrophic fungi and pathogen load depend on tree community   composition and on the presence or absence of particular disease-prone   tree species. All foliar fungi were identified macro-and microscopically   and subjected to statistical analyses at three hierarchical levels, at   the plot level, the level of single tree species and the level of   individual fungus species. There was a negative effect of tree richness   on the pathogen load of common powdery mildew species. Moreover, we   found strong tree species identity effects at the plot level as the   presence of Quercus resulted in a high pathogen load.

We investigated the effect of landscape change on mistletoe   parasitism in fragmented agricultural environments by surveying   mistletoes on eucalypt host trees in 24 landscapes, each 100 km(2) in   size, in south-eastern Australia. Landscapes were selected to represent   a gradient in extent (from 60\% to 2\% cover) and spatial pattern of   remnant wooded vegetation. Mistletoes were surveyed at 15 sites in each   landscape, stratified to sample five types of wooded elements in   proportion to their relative cover. The incidence per landscape of box   mistletoe (Amyema miquelii), the most common species, was best explained   by the extent of wooded cover (non-linear relationship) and mean annual   rainfall. Higher incidence occurred in landscapes with intermediate   levels of cover (15-30\%) and higher rainfall (> 500 mm). Importantly, a   marked non-linear decline in the incidence of A. miquelii in low-cover   landscapes implies a disproportionate loss of this species in remaining   wooded vegetation, greater than that attributable to decreasing forest   cover. The most likely mechanism is the effect of landscape change on   the mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum), the primary seed-dispersal   vector for A. miquelii. Our results are consistent with observations   that habitat fragmentation initially enhances mistletoe occurrence in   agricultural environments; but in this region, when wooded vegetation   fell below a threshold of similar to 15\% landscape cover, the incidence   of A. miquelii declined precipitously. Conservation management will   benefit from greater understanding of the components of landscape   structure that most influence ecological processes, such as mistletoe   parasitism and other plant-animal mutualisms, and the critical stages in   such relationships.

However, mud snails are commonly infected by   trematodes that reduce their overall activity, which in turn may affect   their impact on the surrounding benthic community. To test this   hypothesis, we performed field experiments manipulating both the   abundance of uninfected snails (0, 7500 and 15.000 ind. m(-2)) and the   level of snail parasitism (0, 33 and 100\% trematode prevalence) on a   Danish mud-flat. The results showed that increasing snail abundance and   parasitism generally had opposite effects on the community of   microphytobenthos and zoobenthos. Increasing snail density increased the   chlorophyll-a concentration in the substrate (enhancement), whereas   increasing parasitism decreased it. In accordance, the benthic primary   producers were generally less nutrient limited at high snail density and   mostly so at high levels of snail parasitism. Moreover, epipsammic   diatoms were favoured over epipelic diatoms at increasing snail density,   whereas the opposite was evident at increasing snail parasitism. At the   community level, increasing snail density increased evenness among   epipelic diatoms, whereas increasing snail parasitism decreased evenness   and species diversity. Probably through the action of trophic cascades   and varying levels of disturbance, the zoobenthic community was   influenced by experimental treatments as well. The indirect effects of   snail parasitism influenced significantly the abundance of more faunal   species (seven) than did snail density (two). At the community level,   increasing snail density decreased evenness and lowest species richness   coincided with intermediate snail density. In contrast, increasing snail   parasitism resulted in increasing evenness and peaking species richness   at intermediate level of parasitism. Together, the results show that   parasites solely through their impact on the behaviour of a single   community member can be significant indirect determinants of community   organisation and function.

This paper reviews the   concerns over N in urban stormwater, mechanisms and design enhancements   for N uptake and denitrification through various stormwater control   measures (SCMs), and presents opportunities to integrate this current   knowledge into the regulatory framework. A survey of personnel directly   involved in various aspects of US state and territory NPDES programs   revealed that the top three pollutants of concern were total suspended   solids (TSS), pathogens and bacteria, and total phosphorus (TP).   Surprisingly, nitrate (NO(3)(-)) was of little concern among the survey   respondents, with 3.9\% giving it the highest level of concern, 2.0\%   ranking it second, and 6.0\% ranking it third. When asked which   strategies were currently used in their geographic area for stormwater   management, the most common results were wet ponds and dry ponds. At the   same time, wet ponds and dry ponds were recognized as less effective   practices to manage stormwater.   A review of current literature reveals that several alternative SCMs,   such as bioretention, filters, and wetlands, show greater promise in   their ability to remove N from stormwater than more conventional   practices such as dry ponds and wet ponds. Enhanced N removal via   denitrification and plant uptake is often observed under the combination   of aerobic followed by sustained anoxic conditions, the presence of a   carbon source (organic material), and the presence of mature, dense   vegetation.   Given the lack of concern or awareness of local officials related to N   loading from urban stormwater, and variation in the efficacy of various   SCMs, it is not surprising that regulators remain focused on   conventional dry pond and wet pond control measures. More needs to be   done to quantify the impact of urban sources of Non water quality and   aquatic ecosystems. In addition, greater focus needs to be placed on the   development of design criteria for SCMs, such as bioretention, filters,   and constructed wetlands, which show more promise for N removal.

Changes in   salinity may be gradual or abrupt; for example, heavy rainfall or   evaporation during warm periods can either decrease or increase   salinity. Trematodes are the most common parasites in intertidal   ecosystems and their transmission is known to be highly influenced by   environmental conditions. However, effects of salinity on the   transmission of intertidal trematodes are not well studied. Here, we   investigated the effects of long-term (i.e. several weeks) exposure to   different salinities (25, 30, 35 and 40 psu) on the transmission of   Maritrema novaezealandensis from its first intermediate snail host   (Zeacumantus subcarinatus) to a second intermediate amphipod host   (Paracalliope novizealandiae), in order to evaluate overall net effects.   The following steps were assessed: output of parasite transmission   stages (cercariae) from infected snail hosts, survival and infectivity   of cercariae, susceptibility of amphipod hosts to infection and survival   of amphipod hosts including parasite development within amphipod hosts.   Output and survival of cercariae increased with increasing salinity   whilst infectivity of cercariae and susceptibility of amphipods to   infection were not clearly affected. Survival of amphipods was   significantly longer at lower salinities and parasite development in   infected amphipods was concomitantly more advanced. Overall, the results   suggest that the parasite and the amphipods are differentially affected,   and that under normal to increased salinities conditions are more   favourable for the parasite than for the amphipod host.

There is a   clear potential for synergy between infection and condition: poor   condition predisposes to host infections, which further reduce condition   and so on. To provide empirical data that support this notion, we   measured haematological indicators of infection (neutrophils and   monocytes) and condition (red blood cells (RBCs) and lymphocytes) in   field voles from three populations sampled monthly for 2 years.   Mixed-effect models were developed to evaluate two hypotheses, (i) that   individuals with low lymphocyte and/or RBC levels are more prone to show   elevated haematological indicators of infection when re-sampled four   weeks later, and (ii) that a decline in indicators of condition is   likely to follow the development of monocytosis or neutrophilia. We   found that individuals with low RBC and lymphocyte counts had increased   probabilities of developing monocytosis and higher increments in   neutrophils, and that high indices of infection (neutrophilia and   monocytosis) were generally followed by a declining tendency in the   indicators of condition (RBCs and lymphocytes).

Microbial composition and metabolic function differed   substantially between the four niches. The taxonomic profile showed a   clear shift from an oligotroph-dominated community (e.g. SAR11,   Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus) in the open water and sandy substrate   niches, to a community characterised by an increased frequency of   copiotrophic bacteria (e.g. Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas) in   the coral seawater niches.

D. ferox presented   a great reproductive capacity that would not be constrained by limited   pollen availability or pollinators in the populations studied. Flowers   were pollinated by sphingids, coleopterans and Apis mellifera. The   populations were self-compatible and autogamous; however, they exhibited   higher fruiting percentages by natural pollination. Fruits produced by   autogamy and geitonogamy had larger size and lower seed number and mass   than those derived from natural pollination and xenogamy. D. ferox has   combinations of traits (i.e., two flowering peaks, interactions with   different pollinators, seed production after autogamy or xenogamy) that   provide ecological advantages for establishment and survival processes   in agro-ecosystems, hindering the species' control. Control strategies   might be improved if D. ferox abundance would be reduced before   flowering to avoid fruit and seed production.

Here, we examine common issues   in ecological modelling and suggest criteria for improving modelling   frameworks. An appropriate level of process description is crucial to   constructing the best possible model, given the available data and   understanding of ecological structures. Model details unsupported by   data typically lead to over parameterisation and poor model performance.   Conversely, a lack of mechanistic details may limit a model's ability to   predict ecological systems' responses to management. Ecological studies   that employ models should follow a set of model adequacy assessment   protocols that include: asking a series of critical questions regarding   state and control variable selection, the determinacy of data, and the   sensitivity and validity of analyses. We also need to improve model   elaboration, refinement and coarse graining procedures to better   understand the relevancy and adequacy of our models and the role they   play in advancing theory, improving hind and forecasting, and enabling   problem solving and management.",1062,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

A framework to evaluate how endemic parasites alter nutrient cycling   across varied ecosystems requires an understanding of the following: (i)   parasite effects on host nutrient excretion; (ii) ecosystem nutrient   limitation; (iii) effects of parasite abundance, host density, host   functional role and host excretion rate on nutrient flows; and (iv) how   this infection-induced nutrient flux compares to other pools and fluxes.   Pathogens that significantly increase the availability of a limiting   nutrient within an ecosystem should produce a measurable ecosystem-scale   response.   Here, we combined field-derived estimates of trematode parasite   infections in aquatic snails with measurements of snail excretion and   tissue stoichiometry to show that parasites are capable of altering   nutrient excretion in their intermediate host snails (dominant grazers).   We integrated laboratory measurements of host nitrogen excretion with   field-based estimates of infection in an ecosystem model and compared   these fluxes to other pools and fluxes of nitrogen as measured in the   field. Eighteen nitrogen-limited ponds were examined to determine   whether infection had a measurable effect on ecosystem-scale nitrogen   cycling.   Because of their low nitrogen content and high demand for host carbon,   parasites accelerated the rate at which infected hosts excreted nitrogen   to the water column in a dose-response manner, thereby shifting nutrient   stoichiometry and availability at the ecosystem scale.   Infection-enhanced fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen were similar   to other commonly important environmental sources of bioavailable   nitrogen to the system. Additional field measurements within   nitrogen-limited ponds indicated that nitrogen flux rates from the   periphyton to the water column in high-snail density/high-infection   ponds were up to 50\% higher than low-infection ponds.   By altering host nutrient assimilation/excretion flexibility, parasites   could play a widespread, but currently unrecognized, role in ecosystem   nutrient cycling, especially when parasite and host abundances are high   and hosts play a central role in ecosystem nutrient cycling.",1063,YES,YES,BH,done,yes,,

This hypothesis assumes that species are regulated   by top-down forces in their native range and are likely to be regulated   by bottom-up forces in the invasive range. Neither of these assumptions   has been consistently supported with insects, a group which includes   many destructive invasive species. Winter moth (Operophtera brumata) is   an invasive defoliator in North America that appears to be regulated by   larval mortality. To assess whether regulation was caused by top-down or   bottom-up forces, we sought to identify the main causes of larval   mortality. We used observational and manipulative field and laboratory   studies to demonstrate that larval mortality due to predation,   parasitism, and disease were minimal. We measured the response of larval   dispersal in the field to multiple aspects of foliar quality, including   total phenolics, pH 10 oxidized phenolics, trichome density, total   nitrogen, total carbon, and carbon-nitrogen ratio. Tree-level declines   in density were driven by density-dependent dispersal of early instars.   Late instar larvae dispersed at increased rates from previously damaged   as compared to undamaged foliage, and in 2015 field larval dispersal   rates were related to proportion of oxidative phenolics. We conclude   that larval dispersal is the dominant source of density-dependent larval   mortality, may be mediated by induced changes in foliar quality, and   likely regulates population densities in New England. These findings   suggest that winter moth population densities in New England are   regulated by bottom-up forces, aligning with the natural enemy release   hypothesis.",1064,MAYBE,MAYBE,BH,done,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

To investigate whether differences in secondary metabolites   may explain variability in susceptibility to ARBS in , we used high   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to generate chemical profiles   from healthy tissue in both healthy and diseased sponges, and quantified   peak areas for 15 metabolites. Analyses of healthy and diseased sponges   revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in their chemical   profiles.

Extracts from healthy and diseased sponges inhibited bacterial growth,   and both aplysamine-1 and fistularin-3 displayed selective antibacterial   activity.

Despite the known impacts of lytic phages on the ecology   and evolution of bacteria in free-living communities, little is known   about the role of lytic phages in host-associated microbiomes. We set   out to characterize the impact of phages in the tomato phyllosphere,   that is the bacteria associated with above-ground plant tissues, by   transferring microbial communities from field-grown tomato plants to   juvenile plants grown under mostly sterile conditions in either the   presence or absence of their associated phage community. In three   separate experiments, we found that the presence of phages affects   overall bacterial abundance during colonization of new host plants.   Furthermore, bacterial community analysis using 16S rRNA amplicon   sequencing shows that phages significantly alter the relative abundance   of dominant community members and can influence both within- and   among-host diversity.

For   the activities of lysogens and prophages, we compared the prophage   genomes with the metagenome of free phages. The majority of commensal   bacteria in different taxa were identified as lysogens. More lysogens   were found among Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, than among Bacteroidetes   and Actinobacteria. The prophage genomes shared high sequence similarity   with the metagenome of free phages, indicating that most lysogens   appeared to be active, and that prophages are spontaneously induced as   active phages; dietary interventions changed the composition of the   induced prophages. By contrast, CRISPR-Cas systems were present in few   commensal bacteria, and were rarely active against gut phages. The   structure of the bacteria-phage infection networks was   ``nested-modular'', with modularity emerging across taxonomic scales,   indicating that temperate phage features have developed over a long   phylogenetic timescale.

The   objectives of our study were (1) to compare and describe the   contribution of zoosporic fungi to the eukaryotic diversity in 2 lakes   differing in their trophic status during the mixing and the stratified   seasons and (2) to phylogenetically identify the recovered zoosporic   fungal sequences.

Although the overall structure of the   eukaryotic community was similar between the 2 lakes, at lower taxonomic   levels, community composition differed. Analyses of the retrieved fungal   sequences revealed that zoosporic fungi mostly affiliated with   Rhizophydiales and Chytridiales or formed environmental clades.

In central Argentina, forest fragmentation has   led to species loss of plants, herbivore and parasitoid insects, decline   in trophic processes (herbivory and parasitism), and food web   contraction. Here we examine if and how loss of parasitoid species   following fragmentation causes decreased parasitism rates, by analyzing   food webs of leaf miners and parasitoids from 19 forest fragments of   decreasing size. We asked three questions: Do reductions in parasitoid   richness following fragmentation directly or indirectly affect   parasitism rate? Are changes in community parasitism rate driven by   changes in the parasitism rate of individual leaf miner species, or   changes in leaf miner composition, or both? Which traits of species   determine the effects of food web change on parasitism rates? We found   that habitat loss initiated a bottom-up cascade of extinctions from   plants to leaf miners to parasitoids, with reductions in parasitoid   richness ultimately driving decreases in parasitism rates. This   relationship between parasitoid richness and parasitism depended on   changes in the relative abundance (but not occurrence) of leaf miners   such that parasitoid-rich fragments were dominated by leaf miner species   that supported high rates of parasitism. Surprisingly, we found that   only a small subset of species in the food web could account for much of   the increase in parasitism with parasitoid richness: lepidopteran miners   that attained exceptionally high densities in some fragments and their   largely specialist parasitoids. How specialized a parasitoid is, and the   relative abundance of leaf miners, had important effects on the   diversity-parasitism rate relationship, but not other leaf miner traits   including trophic breadth, body size, and mine shape.

ECM fungi grew   less in the presence of P. pinaster, with P. arhizus being less affected   in growth and thus being more adapted to this association.   Protocatechuic acid was found only in P. involutus, while P. pinaster   roots, both in association and isolated, proved to have other phenolic   acids, such as p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acids. The symbiosis   between P. involutus and P. pinaster had no major effects on the   symbionts, while the association between P. arhizus and P. pinaster   seems to generally decrease the antioxidant effects of both symbionts,   despite the increase in p-coumaric and cinnamic acids in the ECM fungi.",1079,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

In this   context, management focused on individual species must be well   justified. Conservation practices that target carefully selected   individual species can complement pattern-based criteria needed to   maintain species richness and ecosystem function by providing   mechanistic rationale and quantifiable targets for conservation actions.   However, most treatments of landscape design do not consider the   compatibility of management for individual disease-causing species,   invasive species and threatened species simultaneously. We summarize   recommendations from landscape epidemiology and invasion management and   evaluate whether they are congruent with general principles for   vulnerable species' protection. Many, but not all, broad strategies for   controlling invasive and disease species appear compatible with   strategies for protecting vulnerable species. Local circumstances, scale   considerations and the relative importance of landscape and other   interventions should guide management of trade-offs among conflicting   goals.",1080,NO,NO,BH,done,,,

Adler",2013,Indirect effects on mutualisms: parasitism of bumble bees and   pollination service to plants,ECOLOGY,454-464,454-464,10.1890/12-0406.1,"Researchers increasingly recognize the important role of mutualisms in   structuring communities and view positive interactions in a community   context rather than as simple pairwise interactions. Indirect effects,   such as those that predators have on lower trophic levels, are a key   process in community ecology. However, such top-down indirect effects   have rarely been extended to mutualisms. Antagonists of one mutualist   have the potential to negatively affect the second mutualist through   negative effects on their partner, and the magnitude of such effects   should vary with mutualism strength. Bumble bees are ecologically and   economically important pollinators that are an ideal system to determine   if such indirect effects play an important role in mutualisms. Bumble   bees are attacked by an array of parasites and predators, and they   interact with a range of plants that vary in their dependence on bumble   bees for reproduction. We tested whether variation in parasitism rates   by Nosema bombi, Crithidia bombi, and conopid flies correlated with   reproduction of greenhouse-raised plants placed in the field. At   multiple sites over two years, we studied four plant species that varied   in reliance on bumble bees as pollinators. We found a consistent   negative relationship between Nosema parasitism and measures of   pollination for Trifolium pratense and Solanum carolinense, plant   species with high bumble bee visitation, whereas Rudbeckia hirta and   Daucus carota, plant species with generalized pollination, experienced   no impacts of Nosema. However, both Crithidia and conopids showed   inconsistent relationships with pollination service. Although these   patterns are correlational, they provide evidence that parasites of   bumble bees may have negative indirect effects on plants, and that   mutualism strength can moderate the magnitude of such effects.",1081,YES,YES,BH,done,yes,,

This fungus and its beetle   associate D. ponderosae are expanding in large epidemics in western   North America. Using the fungal genome sequence and gene annotations, we   assessed whether fungal isolates from the two beetles inhabiting   different species of pine in epidemic regions of western Canada and the   USA, as well as in localized populations outside of the current   epidemic, represent different genetic lineages. We characterized   nucleotide variations in 67 genomic regions and selected 15 for the   phylogenetic analysis. Using concordance of gene genealogies and   distinct ecological characteristics, we identified two sibling   phylogenetic species: Gc and Gs. Where the closely related Pinus   ponderosa and P. jeffreyi are infested by localized populations of their   respective beetles, Gc is present. In contrast, Gs is an exclusive   associate of D. ponderosae mainly present on its primary host-tree P.   contorta; however, in the current epidemic areas, it is also found in   other pine species. These results suggest that the host-tree species and   the beetle population dynamics may be important factors associated with   the genetic divergence and diversity of fungal partners in the   beetle-tree ecosystems.

However, determining the dynamics of wildlife diseases and understanding   the impact on host populations is a significant challenge. In Hawai'i,   there is ample circumstantial evidence that introduced avian malaria   (Plasmodium relictum) has played an important role in the decline and   extinction of many native forest birds. However, few studies have   attempted to estimate disease transmission and mortality, survival, and   individual species impacts in this distinctive ecosystem. We combined   multi-state capture-recapture (longitudinal) models with cumulative   age-prevalence (cross-sectional) models to evaluate these patterns in   Apapane, Hawai'i Amakihi, and Iiwi in low-, mid-, and high-elevation   forests on the island of Hawai'i based on four longitudinal studies of   3-7 years in length. We found species-specific patterns of malaria   prevalence, transmission, and mortality rates that varied among   elevations, likely in response to ecological factors that drive mosquito   abundance. Malaria infection was highest at low elevations, moderate at   mid elevations, and limited in high-elevation forests. Infection rates   were highest for Iiwi and Apapane, likely contributing to the absence of   these species in low-elevation forests. Adult malaria fatality rates   were highest for Iiwi, intermediate for Amakihi at mid and high   elevations, and lower for Apapane; low-elevation Amakihi had the lowest   malaria fatality, providing strong evidence of malaria tolerance in this   low-elevation population. Our study indicates that hatch-year birds may   have greater malaria infection and/or fatality rates than adults. Our   study also found that mosquitoes prefer feeding on Amakihi rather than   Apapane, but Apapane are likely a more important reservoir for malaria   transmission to mosquitoes. Our approach, based on host abundance and   infection rates, may be an effective alternative to mosquito blood meal   analysis for determining vector-host contacts when mosquito densities   are low and collection of blood-fed mosquitoes is impractical. Our study   supports the hypothesis that avian malaria has been a primary factor   influencing the elevational distribution and abundance of these three   species, and likely limits other native Hawaiian species that are   susceptible to malaria.",1083,YES,YES,BH,done,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

It is thought that abundant   co-occurring viruses play an important role in regulating population   dynamics of cyanobacteria and thus the cycling of carbon in the oceans.   Despite this, little is known about how viral infections `play-out' in   the environment, particularly whether infections are resource or energy   limited. Photoautotrophic organisms represent an ideal model to test   this since available energy is modulated by the incoming light intensity   through photophosphorylation. Therefore, we exploited phototrophy of the   environmentally relevant marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus and   monitored growth of a cyanobacterial virus (cyanophage). We found that   light intensity has a marked effect on cyanophage infection dynamics,   but that this is not manifest by a change in DNA synthesis. Instead,   cyanophage development appears energy limited for the synthesis of   proteins required during late infection. We posit that acquisition of   auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) involved in light-dependent   photosynthetic reactions acts to overcome this limitation. We show that   cyanophages actively modulate expression of these AMGs in response to   light intensity and provide evidence that such regulation may be   facilitated by a novel mechanism involving light-dependent splicing of a   group I intron in a photosynthetic AMG. Altogether, our data offers a   mechanistic link between diurnal changes in irradiance and observed   community level responses in metabolism, i.e., through an   irradiance-dependent, viral-induced release of dissolved organic matter   (DOM).",1084,YES,YES,BH,done,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

In a   factorial greenhouse experiment, we tested the effects of the AM   symbiosis and precipitation regime on the performance (growth, gas   exchange, nutrient status and mycorrhizal responsiveness) of Boswellia   papyrifera seedlings. A continuous precipitation regime was imitated by   continuous watering of plants to field capacity every other day during 4   months, and irregular precipitation by pulsed watering of plants where   watering was switched every 15 days during these 4 months, with 15 days   of watering followed by 15 days without watering. There were   significantly higher levels of AM colonization under irregular   precipitation regime than under continuous precipitation. Mycorrhizal   seedlings had higher biomass than control seedlings. Stomatal   conductance and phosphorus mass fraction in shoot and root were also   significantly higher for mycorrhizal seedlings. Mycorrhizal seedlings   under irregular watering had the highest biomass. Both a larger leaf   area and higher assimilation rates contributed to higher biomass. Under   irregular watering, the water use efficiency increased in   non-mycorrhizal seedlings through a reduction in transpiration, while in   mycorrhizal seedlings irregular watering increased transpiration.   Because assimilation rates increased even more, mycorrhizal seedlings   achieved an even higher water use efficiency. Boswellia seedlings   allocated almost all carbon to the storage root. Boswellia seedlings had   higher mass fractions of N, P, and K in roots than in shoots.

Walker",2016,Parametric analysis of technology costs for CO2 storage in saline   formations,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL,574-587,574-587,10.1016/j.ijggc.2016.08.027,"the last decade, a substantial amount of economic, engineering, and   geoscience research has focused on storing CO2 in geological formations.   Of those different formations, storage in saline water-bearing   formations represents the largest storage potential. Fossil fuel-based   power plants in the U.S. (coal and natural gas) contributed to 40\% of   all CO2 emissions in 2008 and therefore represent an important factor to   address atmospheric CO2 emissions.   The Water, Energy and Carbon Sequestration Simulation Model (WECSsim)   was developed to calculate water use and treatment options, CO2   injection volumes and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) results for   both a single representative power plant paired with a saline formation   scenario, and a full power plant fleet. The details of the analysis   presented here broadly demonstrate the sensitivity of CO2 capture and   storage (CCS) costs in geologic saline formations with water extraction,   treatment and reuse to changes in the water demands associated with   implementing CCS across the power plant fleet (coal and natural gas).   The majority of the coal and natural gas plants in the U.S. have an   avoided cost of \$70-200 per tonne of CO2. Storing 1.0 Gt/yr of the   nation's 2.3 Gt/yr total CO2 emissions returns an avoided (storage) cost   of range 79-143 (57-81) \$/t (\$US 2013) under various scenarios. These   scenarios include allowing competition between power plants for saline   formation space to store CO2, varying the duration of the storage   rights, and permitting the extraction of saline waters for treatment.   Under the same 1 Gt/yr captured scenario, the extracted and treated   water volumes could offset 12\% of the added water demand due to the   parasitic energy requirements of CCS at the national level. The cost of   water treatment, using a reverse osmosis system, ranges between   approximately \$3.20/m(3) water( for larger, older coal-fired plants   like the San Juan Power Generating Station) and \$2.60/m(3) water for   natural gas combined cycle plants (such as the Oyster Creek Power   Generating Station) with substantial variability in costs based on plant   location and design. For context, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE)   composition of the pulverized coal-based San Juan Generation Station is   52\%, 43\% and 5\% for the base LCOE, parasitic energy requirements, and   water extraction, treatment and utilization costs, respectively.   Similarly, for the Oyster Creek natural gas combined cycle plant, these   percentages are 64\%, 33\%, and 2\% of the total LCOE, respectively. In   both technology cases the parasitic energy requirement costs far out   weigh the cost to extract, treat, transport, and utilize saline   formation waters.   Additional results indicate that of the 325 saline formations included   in the national-level analysis, the Mt. Simon formation has an estimated   capacity to hold 53\% of all the CO2 generated from the U.S. coal and   natural gas-based power plants without extracting and treating saline   water. The St. Peter Sandstone formation could hold 43\%, though with   saline water extraction and treatment. These results suggest that   focusing research, development and demonstration (RD\&D) efforts on   careful geologic site selection and reducing the parasitic energy   penalty, and its respective costs, will help lower the overall cost of   CCS across the U.S. coal and natural gas-based power plant fleet.
