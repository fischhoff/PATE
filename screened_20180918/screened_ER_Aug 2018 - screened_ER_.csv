However,   spatio-temporal changes in community structure induced by AI, and their   relation to ecosystem functioning, remain largely unexplored. Here, we   analysed 16 quantitative cereal aphid-parasitoid and   parasitoid-hyperparasitoid food webs, replicated four times during the   season, under contrasting AI regimes (organic farming in complex   landscapes vs. conventional farming in simple landscapes). High AI   increased food web complexity but also temporal variability in   aphid-parasitoid food webs and in the dominant parasitoid species   identity. Enhanced complexity and variability appeared to be controlled   bottom-up by changes in aphid dominance structure and evenness. Contrary   to the common expectations of positive biodiversity-ecosystem   functioning relationships, community complexity (food-web complexity,   species richness and evenness) was negatively related to primary   parasitism rates. However, this relationship was positive for secondary   parasitoids. Despite differences in community structures among different   trophic levels, ecosystem services (parasitism rates) and disservices   (aphid abundances and hyperparasitism rates) were always higher in   fields with low AI. Hence, community structure and ecosystem functioning   appear to be differently influenced by AI, and change differently over   time and among trophic levels. In conclusion, intensified agriculture   can support diverse albeit highly variable parasitoid-host communities,   but ecosystem functioning might not be easy to predict from observed   changes in community structure and composition.",1087,N,ER,,,

Frank van Veen,2015,Plant-modified trophic interactions,CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE,29-33,29-33,10.1016/j.cois.2015.02.009,"Plants can modify the interactions between herbivorous insects and their   natural enemies in various ways. Chemical defences from the plants   against herbivores may in fact harm the latter's natural enemies,   thereby weakening the trophic interaction. On the other hand, volatile   chemicals produced by the plant in response to herbivory may attract   natural enemies, thereby strengthening the interaction. Recent research   shows that effects of plants on insect interactions are not curious   phenomena confined to a few specialist species but rather that they are   ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems and often involve complex   interactions among many species. The major challenge now is to study how   the commonly reported short-term effects of plants affect long term   dynamics of insect interactions in the context of complex natural   communities.",1089,N,ER,,,

Grewell,2008,Parasite facilitates plant species coexistence in a coastal wetland,ECOLOGY,1481-1488,1481-1488,10.1890/07-0896.1,"Outbreaks of infectious agents in natural ecosystems are on the rise.   Understanding host-pathogen interactions and their impact on community   composition may be central to the conservation of biological diversity.   Infectious agents can convey both exploitive and facilitative effects   that regulate host populations and community structure. Parasitic   angiosperms are highly conspicuous in many plant communities, and they   provide a tractable model for understanding parasite effects in   multispecies communities. I examined host identity and variation in host   infectivity of a holoparasitic vine (Cuscuta salina) within a California   salt marsh. In a two-year parasite removal experiment, I measured the   effect of C. salina on its most frequent host, a rare hemiparasite, and   the plant community. C. salina clearly suppressed the dominant host, but   rare plant fitness and plant species diversity were enhanced through   indirect effects. Priority effects played a role in the strength of the   outcome due to the timing of life history characteristics. The   differential influence of parasites on the fecundity of multiple hosts   can change population dynamics, benefit rare species, and alter   community structure. The continuum of negative to positive consequences   of parasitic interactions deserves more attention if we are to   understand community dynamics and successfully restore tidal wetlands.",1090,N,ER,,,

Recently,   parasitic fungi, termed chytrids, have been found to play important   roles in aquatic food webs. Yet, the diversity and community structure   of planktonic fungi including chytrids are not well studied. In this   study, we examined the temporal fluctuations of freshwater fungi,   including chytrids, in Lake Inba by using molecular techniques of   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE profiles, and   associated sequence analysis, indicated that chytrids were present on   all sampling dates from May to October (n = 12). In addition, analysis   showed that a large proportion of the sequences belonged to chytrids of   both parasitic and saprotrophic species. This finding was supported by   microscopic observations using Calcofluor white to stain chytrids   infecting various phytoplankton species. The percentages of infection by   chytrids on two dominant diatom species, Aulacoseira granulata and   Aulacoseira ambigua, showed a similar seasonal pattern in the DGGE band   profiles. From the phylogenetic analysis and microscopic identification,   the chytrids infecting the two diatoms are likely to be affiliated to   Chytriomyces sp. and Zygorhizidium sp.. This is the first study to show   that DGGE is a useful preliminary approach for examining the diversity   of planktonic fungi including chytrids. Our results indicate both   parasitic and saprotrophic chytrids are a significant component of   freshwater fungi inhabiting the pelagic zone of Lake Inba, Japan.   Further modification of DGGE, together with new molecular techniques and   microscopic observation, would reveal the hidden diversity and   ecological significance of planktonic fungi in aquatic ecosystems.",1091,N,ER,,,

The   impact of coevolution on these processes will depend on its rate, which   is likely to be affected by the energy flowing through an ecosystem, or   productivity. We addressed how productivity affected rates of   coevolution during a coevolutionary arms race between experimental   populations of bacteria and their parasitic viruses (phages). As   hypothesized, the rate of coevolution between bacterial resistance and   phage infectivity increased with increased productivity. This   relationship can in part be explained by reduced competitiveness of   resistant bacteria in low compared with high productivity environments,   leading to weaker selection for resistance in the former. The data   further suggest that variation in productivity can generate variation in   selection for resistance across landscapes, a result that is crucial to   the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.",1092,N,ER,,,

As EIDs and their impacts grow, landscape-to regional-scale   models of disease dynamics are increasingly needed for quantitative   prediction of epidemic outcomes and design of practicable strategies for   control. Here we use spatio-temporal, stochastic epidemiological   modeling in combination with realistic geographical modeling to predict   the spread of the sudden oak death pathogen (Phytophthora ramorum)   through heterogeneous host populations in wildland forests, subject to   fluctuating weather conditions. The model considers three stochastic   processes: (1) the production of inoculum at a given site; (2) the   chance that inoculum is dispersed within and among sites; and (3) the   probability of infection following transmission to susceptible host   vegetation. We parameterized the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo   (MCMC) estimation from snapshots of local-and regional-scale data on   disease spread, taking account of landscape heterogeneity and the   principal scales of spread. Our application of the model to Californian   landscapes over a 40-year period (1990-2030), since the approximate time   of pathogen introduction, revealed key parameters driving the spatial   spread of disease and the magnitude of stochastic variability in   epidemic outcomes. Results show that most disease spread occurs via   local dispersal (, 250 m) but infrequent long-distance dispersal events   can substantially accelerate epidemic spread in regions with high host   availability and suitable weather conditions. In the absence of   extensive control, we predict a ten-fold increase in disease spread   between 2010 and 2030 with most infection concentrated along the north   coast between San Francisco and Oregon. Long-range dispersal of inoculum   to susceptible host communities in the Sierra Nevada foothills and   coastal southern California leads to little secondary infection due to   lower host availability and less suitable weather conditions. However, a   shift to wetter and milder conditions in future years would double the   amount of disease spread in California through 2030. This research   illustrates how stochastic epidemiological models can be applied to   realistic geographies and used to increase predictive understanding of   disease dynamics in large, heterogeneous regions.",1093,N,ER,,,

There are strong indications that both groups engage in multiple   interactions, including mycophagy and decomposition of TA shells,   processes which might be fundamental in nutrient cycling in certain   ecosystems. Here, we present the results of an experiment focusing on   interactions between TA and saprotrophic microfungi colonizing Scots   pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) litter needles. The needles were collected   from a temperate pine forest and cultivated in damp chambers. Over a few   weeks, melanized mycelium of Anavirga laxa Sutton started to grow out of   some needles; simultaneously, the common forest-soil TA Phryganella   acropodia (Hertwig and Lesser) Hopkinson reproduced and spread around   the mycelium. We investigated whether a potential relationship between   TA and saprotrophic microfungi exists by comparing the composition of TA   communities on and around the needles and testing the spatial   relationship between the A. laxa mycelium and P. acropodia shells in the   experimental microcosm. Additionally, we asked whether P. acropodia   utilized the A. laxa mycelium as a nutrient source and screened whether   P. acropodia shells were colonized by the microfungi inhabiting the   experimental microcosm. Our results indicate that saprotrophic   microfungi may affect the composition of TA communities and their   mycelium may affect distribution of TA individuals in pine litter. Our   observations suggest that P. acropodia did not graze directly on A. laxa   mycelium, but rather fed on its exudates or bacteria associated with the   exudates. The fungus Pochonia bulbillosa (Gams \& Malla) Zare \& Gams   was often found parasitising encysted shells or decomposing already dead   individuals of P. acropodia. TA and pine litter microfungi engage in   various direct and indirect interactions which are still poorly   understood and deserve further investigation. Their elucidation will   improve our knowledge on fundamental processes influencing coexistence   of soil microflora and microfauna.",1094,N,ER,,,

Marine protected areas   (MPAs) have been widely advocated for conserving and managing marine   biodiversity yet, despite extensive research, their benefits for   conserving non-target species and wider ecosystem functions remain   unclear. Here, we demonstrate that MPAs can increase the resilience of   coral reef communities to natural disturbances, including coral   bleaching, coral diseases, Acanthaster planci outbreaks and storms.   Using a 20-year time series from Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we show   that within MPAs, (1) reef community composition was 21-38\% more   stable; (2) the magnitude of disturbance impacts was 30\% lower and (3)   subsequent recovery was 20\% faster that in adjacent unprotected   habitats. Our results demonstrate that MPAs can increase the resilience   of marine communities to natural disturbance possibly through herbivory,   trophic cascades and portfolio effects.",1095,N,ER,,,

For example, local adaptation, a particular type of   genetic by environmental (G*E) interaction in which the fitness of a   population in its own habitat is greater than in other habitats, is   often invoked in management practices, even in the absence of supporting   evidence. Despite increasing attention to the potential for G*E   interactions, few studies have tested multiple populations and   environments simultaneously, limiting our understanding of the spatial   consistency in patterns of adaptive genetic variation. In addition, few   studies explicitly differentiate adaptation in response to predation   from other biological and environmental factors. We conducted a   reciprocal transplant experiment of first-generation eastern oyster   (Crassostrea virginica) juveniles from six populations across three   field sites spanning 1000 km in the southeastern Atlantic Bight in both   the presence and absence of predation to test for G*E variation in   this economically valuable and ecologically important species. We   documented significant G*E variation in survival and growth, yet there   was no evidence for local adaptation. Condition varied across oyster   cohorts: Offspring of northern populations had better condition than   offspring from the center of our region. Oyster populations in the   southeastern Atlantic Bight differ in juvenile survival, growth, and   condition, yet offspring from local broodstock do not have higher   survival or growth than those from farther away.

Emerging diseases in marine and terrestrial systems have been the   subject of several high-profile syntheses but there are no such   overviews of emerging diseases in fresh waters. The distinct differences   associated with fresh waters merit the separate consideration given to   freshwater emerging diseases in this Special Issue.   2. Unique aspects of freshwater environments that can be expected to   influence disease emergence include the following: the extreme levels of   environmental degradation, overfishing and biodiversity loss arising   from preferential human settlement near freshwater bodies for millenia;   their relatively small volume and the attraction of animal aggregations   that promote disease transmission; and their role as arteries linking   terrestrial and marine environments.   3. Understanding emerging diseases entails addressing the multiple   drivers that influence the dynamics of host-parasite interactions in a   changing world. Structural and functional transformations of ecosystems   caused by overfishing may act as an important underlying driver.   4. Climate change may promote disease emergence, but environmental   change may cause some diseases to diminish as a result of changes in   distributions and abundances of hosts and disease agents. Furthermore,   rapid evolution may constrain disease emergence despite environmental   change.   5. Appreciating that parasites and pathogens are functional components   of healthy ecosystems and that their dynamics may even portend ecosystem   change would foster a more complete and balanced view of the value of   biodiversity and the ecological role of disease.   6.

Durham",2017,Applying community ecological theory to maximize productivity of   cultivated biocrusts,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,1958-1969,1958-1969,10.1002/eap.1582,"Degraded rangelands around the world may benefit from the   reestablishment of lost biological soil crusts (biocrusts, soil surface   cryptogamic-microbial communities). Cultivation of biocrust organisms is   the first step in this process, and may benefit from harnessing species   interactions. Species interactions are a dominant force structuring   ecological communities. One key element of community structure, species   richness, is itself important because it can promote the productivity of   the entire community. Here, we use biological soil crusts as a model to   test the effects of species interactions on production of biocrust   materials for use in ecosystem rehabilitation. We screened eight   different moss and lichen species from semiarid rangelands of Montana,   USA, for growth potential under two watering regimes. Mosses generally   grew well, but we were unable to cultivate the selected lichen species.   We produced a >400\% increase in the biomass of one species (Ceratodon   purpureus). We tested whether a parasite-host relationship between two   lichens could be used to enhance productivity of the parasite species,   but this also resulted in no net gain of lichen productivity. Finally,   we constructed all possible community combinations from a pool of five   moss species to test for overyielding (community productivity exceeding   that expected from the growth of community members in monoculture), and   to determine both if, and the mode in which, species richness increases   productivity. Polycultures yielded more than would be expected based   upon the production of community constituents in monoculture. Using   structural equation models, we determined that there was a modest effect   of species richness on community productivity (r = 0.24-0.25), which was   independent of a stronger effect of the identity of species in the   community (r = 0.41-0.50).

In tropical   agroecosystems, ants interact with crop mutualists and antagonists,   however, little is known about effects of dominants ant community   properties on the consequence of such cascading interactions which can   be measured through final ecosystem service, crop yield. Here, we   present a replicated ant fauna manipulation experiment in cocoa   agroecosystems, where we used ant exclusion treatments to test the   economic importance of the presence of ants, and two additional   treatments where we experimentally introduced one of two common dominant   ant species which allowed comparing their effects with those of the   naturally occurring ant fauna. The proximate aim was to assess the   impact of ants Crematogaster sp., aunponotus brutus Auguste Henri Forel   and Oecophylla longinoda Latreille on cacao yield, which is known to   depend on several, cascading intermediate ecosystem services (e.g.   control of specific pests). Ants provided ecosystem services in term of   reduced pest damage caused by Salhbergella singularis Hagh (Hemiptera:   Miridae) and Characoma stictigrapta limps (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) but   also disservices such as increased pathogen disease caused by Phyphthora   megakarya Brasier and Griffin dissemination and indirectly enhanced   damage of other pest species. Yields were highest in non-manipulated and   species-rich ant communities, whereas ant exclusion and communities   dominated by a single species decreased yield by more than 30\%.   Associated ant communities between dominant and non-dominant species   resulted in the same yields as in non-manipulated controls. Dominant ant   communities maximized the control of a particular pest species, but not   cacao yield. We show a positive relationship between ant species rich   communities and financial performance and we postulate that complex   agroecosystems can offer competitive business opportunities for   small-scale farmers, while contributing to biodiversity conservation.

The structural complexity of agricultural landscapes influences the   local biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Hence, developing   effective biodiversity management requires a better understanding of the   relative importance of local and landscape changes, especially for   functionally important organisms such as hover flies benefiting from   flowering plants.   2. We examined hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in broad and   narrow sown flower strips, in naturally developed grassy strips and in   wheat fields (as a control). We also investigated the effects of these   four habitat types on syrphid occurrence in the adjacent wheat fields.   3. The relative influence of local vs. landscape effects was tested by   selecting study sites along a gradient of structural complexity from   simple landscapes (similar to 100\% arable land) to complex landscapes   (up to 70\% semi-natural habitats such as fallows, field margins, hedges   and grassland). Landscape complexity was assessed within landscape   sectors of 0.5-4.0 km radius around strips.   4. Syrphid density and in particular, the density of aphidophagous   species, was higher in narrow and broad sown flower strips compared to   grassy strips and wheat-wheat boundary controls at the milk-ripening   stage of the wheat. In addition, species richness of aphidophagous   syrphids within wheat fields adjacent to broad sown flower strips was   higher at the wheat peak-ripening stage. This indicates a spillover   between habitats and a positive effect of these sown flower strips on   potential biocontrol of cereal aphids. Flower densities and syrphid   diversity and density, respectively, were closely related.   5. Species richness and abundance in the sown flower strips increased as   the proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape increased,   suggesting that within structurally simple landscapes (at 0.5-1 km   radius around the sites) syrphid flies concentrated on the most   rewarding resources within the sown flower strips. Sown flower strips   were more effective at increasing syrphid species richness and abundance   in simple landscapes, presumably because the creation of flower   resources made the greatest difference in such homogeneous, intensively   managed arable landscapes.   6. Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes should take the   surrounding landscape characteristics into account when considering   using sown flower strips to enhance syrphid density and diversity, and   their biocontrol function, in arable landscapes. Creating locally such   flower strips is more effective in simple landscapes containing a high   proportion of arable land, while in complex landscapes, keeping the   overall diversity is important.",1100,N,ER,,,

In Big Sur, overstory   tree mortality following P. ramorum invasion has been extensive in   redwood and mixed evergreen forests, where the pathogen kills true oaks   and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus). Sampling was conducted across   a full-factorial combination of disease/no disease and burned/unburned   conditions in both forest types. Forest floor organic matter and   associated nutrients were greater in unburned redwood compared to   unburned mixed evergreen forests. Post-fire element pools were similar   between forest types, but lower in burned-invaded compared to   burned-uninvaded plots. We found evidence disease-generated fuels led to   increased loss of forest floor C, N, Ca, and P. The same effects were   associated with lower \% C and higher PO4-P in the mineral soil.   Fire-disease interactions were linear functions of pre-fire host   mortality which was similar between the forest types. Our analysis   suggests that these effects increased forest floor C loss by as much as   24.4 and 21.3 \% in redwood and mixed evergreen forests, respectively,   with similar maximum losses for the other forest floor elements.

We evaluated the response of maize (Zea   mays L.) to PSB inoculation under controlled and field conditions in   Tucuman, Argentina. A pot culture experiment was conducted to   investigate the effects of seven previously isolated PSB on early   development of plants. Seeds were treated with each bacterial strain,   and seedlings were harvested 30 days after inoculation. All strains   showed a positive effect on plant growth. A significant increment in   plant height (45\%), shoot dry weight (40\%) was determined in plants   treated with Pseudomonas tolaasii IEXb, while Pseudomonas koreensis SP28   has remarkably increased P content compared to the uninoculated control.   IEXb strain was selected and evaluated under field conditions in   combination with triple superphosphate (TSP) as P fertilizer. The   presence of IEXb strain stimulated seedling emergence (8\%), shoot   length (19\%), grain yield (44\%), 1000-grain weight (18\%), total dry   biomass (32\%) and P content (56\%) of maize plants. In general, P.   tolaasii IEXb inoculation was more efficient as bioinoculant without P   fertilizer than with TSP.

Intuitively, the movement behavior   and life history of vectors influence pathogen spread, but the relative   contribution of each factor has not been examined. Recent research has   highlighted the influence of host infection status on vector behavior   and life history. Here, we developed a model to explore how vector   traits influence the spread of vector-borne plant viruses. We allowed   vector life history (growth rate, carrying capacity) and movement   behavior (departure and settlement rates) parameters to be conditional   on whether the plant host is infected or healthy and whether the vector   is viruliferous (carrying the virus) or not. We ran simulations under a   wide range of parameter combinations and quantified the fraction of   hosts infected over time. We also ran case studies of the model for   Barley yellow dwarf virus, a persistently transmitted virus, and for   Potato virus Y, a non-persistently transmitted virus. We quantified the   relative importance of each parameter on pathogen spread using Latin   hypercube sampling with the statistical partial rank correlation   coefficient technique. We found two general types of mechanisms in our   model that increased the rate of pathogen spread. First, increasing   factors such as vector intrinsic growth rate, carrying capacity, and   departure rate from hosts (independent of whether these factors were   condition-dependent) led to more vectors moving between hosts, which   increased pathogen spread. Second, changing condition-dependent factors   such as a vector's preference for settling on a host with a different   infection status than itself, and vector tendency to leave a host of the   same infection status, led to increased contact between hosts and   vectors with different infection statuses, which also increased pathogen   spread. Overall, our findings suggest that vector population growth   rates had the greatest influence on rates of virus spread, but rates of   vector dispersal from infected hosts and from hosts of the same   infection status were also very important. Our model highlights the   importance of simultaneously considering vector life history and   behavior to better understand pathogen spread. Although developed for   plant viruses, our model could readily be utilized with other   vector-borne pathogen systems.",1104,N,ER,,,

Limited host range   and differing genetic potential of individual virus types mean that   investigations into the types of viruses that exist in the ocean and   their spatial distribution throughout the world's oceans are critical to   understanding the global impacts of marine viruses. Here we evaluate   viral morphological characteristics (morphotype, capsid diameter and   tail length) using a quantitative transmission electron microscopy   (qTEM) method across six of the world's oceans and seas sampled through   the Tara Oceans Expedition. Extensive experimental validation of the   qTEM method shows that neither sample preservation nor preparation   significantly alters natural viral morphological characteristics. The   global sampling analysis demonstrated that morphological characteristics   did not vary consistently with depth (surface versus deep chlorophyll   maximum waters) or oceanic region. Instead, temperature, salinity and   oxygen concentration, but not chlorophyll a concentration, were more   explanatory in evaluating differences in viral assemblage morphological   characteristics. Surprisingly, given that the majority of cultivated   bacterial viruses are tailed, non-tailed viruses appear to numerically   dominate the upper oceans as they comprised 51-92\% of the viral   particles observed.

The   magnitude of current white pine blister rust (WPBR) infection caused by   the pathogen Cronartium ribicola and mountain pine beetle (MPB;   Dendroctonus ponderosae) impacts, combined with the effect of climate   change on beetle population dynamics, are placing this foundation   species in a precarious state. We collected stand- and tree-level data   in three whitebark pine systems in the southern Greater Yellowstone   Ecosystem to evaluate current conditions and to determine how   characteristics of individual whitebark pine trees, including the   presence and severity of white pine blister rust, influence host   selection by the MPB. Data revealed that 45\% of all whitebark pine   trees sampled were dead. In addition, 67\% of all trees sampled were   attacked by MPB, 83\% were infected with WPBR, and 62\% were affected by   both. Whitebark pine trees that were selected as hosts by MPB exhibited   significantly greater blister rust severity than trees that were not   selected. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified a complex set   of tree characteristics related to host selection by MPB; in addition to   rust severity, stand type (mixed species or pure whitebark pine) and   tree diameter were also significant predictors of selection. The   interaction among MPB selection patterns, blister rust severity, tree   diameter, and stand type quantified in this study will likely continue   to influence the disturbance pattern and severity in whitebark pine   ecosystems in the Greater Yellowstone Area.

Natural infection of sunflower with P. halstedii   was monitored in a sunflower field cultivated for ornamental purpose in   soil where no sunflower had been grown before. Local and systemic   infections were observed in plants of different developmental stages   which were sown in five consecutive field plots between Apr. and Jul.   The airborne origin of the infection by zoosporangia was concluded from   field history, pathogenic symptoms, time course of infection and   microscopic investigation of mycelium distribution in stems. A high   potential for transition from local to systemic infection was found, at   least in ornamental sunflower cultivation under the typical weather   conditions in Central Europe. This questions the paradigm that   economically and epidemiologically relevant sunflower downy mildew   incidences are only derived from subterranean infections.

Dominance of native or alien competitive plants causes competitive   exclusion of subordinate species and represents a major mechanism   reducing biodiversity following land-use changes. The successful   competitive strategies may, however, be interfered with by parasitic   plants, which withdraw resources from other plants' vasculature.   Parasitism may strongly reduce the growth of the dominants, which may   facilitate regeneration of other species and consequently trigger   restoration of natural communities of high diversity.   2. Here, we aim to provide robust empirical evidence demonstrating this   restoration potential of parasitic plants. We present a case study   testing suppressive effects of hemiparasitic Rhinanthus alectorolophus   on competitive grass Calamagrostis epigejos. In recent decades, C.   epigejos has invaded many high-nature-value semi-natural grasslands of   Central Europe, which is one of the prominent factors causing their   biodiversity decline.   3. We conducted three manipulative field experiments testing the effect   of sowing of R. alectorolophus in different vegetation types infested by   C. epigejos. Rhinanthus sowing was compared to different mowing   treatments recommended as the `best practice' management at respective   sites.   4. Rhinanthus alectorolophus established itself in most C.   epigejos-dominated plots where sown. Calamagrostis epigejos was   virtually exterminated in 2 years in two of the experiments (dry meadow   and industrial area). In the wet-meadow experiment, the suppressive   effect was variable as a result of uneven establishment success of   Rhinanthus. In this experiment increased mowing intensity had an   additional suppressive effect on C. epigejos. Rhinanthus also increased   regeneration potential of other species by a temporary reduction of   vegetation density. Restoration of target vegetation composition was,   however, dependent on community context.   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrated that hemiparasitic   Rhinanthus alectorolophus is an accessible and efficient tool for   targeted biological control of Calamagrostis epigejos, with a great   potential to restore infested grassland vegetation. The strong effect of   Rhinanthus is caused by interference with the underground storage and   clonal growth strategy of Calamagrostis epigejos, which are both traits   that underlie its competitive ability. The potential of native parasitic   plants should be considered in restoration management of sites infested   by competitive dominants, either alien or native.",1109,N,ER,,,

Characterizing the dynamics of this initial   microbial colonization process is a key to understanding how these   rapidly receding glacier areas are colonized. This study examines   primary successions of bacteria, fungi and algae in two glacier   forefields chronosequences on opposite slopes of Cordillera Darwin   (Tierra del Fuego, Chile). Both slopes (southern and northern) show   contrasting climate factors along with rapid rates of plant succession.   Through a high-throughput sequencing approach, we identified   Cyanobacteria as the dominant bacteria in younger soils close to the   glacier terminus, whereas abundances of Alphaproteobacteria and   Acidobacteria increased with soil surface age. Lichen-forming fungi and   parasitic fungi were the most abundant fungal groups in younger   succession stages, while saprophytic and mycorrhizal orders dominated   later stages. The order Prasiolales predominated algal communities close   to the glacier terminus, while Microthamniales and Chlamydomonadales   orders dominated subsequent succession stages. Our observations reflect   a changing community structure over time of the three microbial groups   examined, and the replacement of taxa during the succession. Changes in   composition are especially marked between the youngest succession states   and subsequent ones in both forefields. Simultaneous analysis of   bacterial, fungal and algal communities revealed the different   trajectories of the three groups, with bacterial and fungal communities   showing more marked succession patterns. Our results point to more   relevant roles for bacteria at the initial stages of succession, while   fungi could play a dominant role over bacteria as succession progresses.   The ubiquity of algal taxa along the chronosequences was also observed.   The two glacier forefields showed different microbial temporal dynamics,   indicating that local factors affect the rate of microbial community   assembly and, consequently, drive the primary succession process.",1110,N,ER,,,

We used litter bags with senescent leaves to assess   the density, richness and biomass of invertebrates and assessed the mass   loss of litter after oven drying. The mean decomposition coefficient (k   = -0.0037day (-1)) was lower than reported rates for other semi-arid   lakes. We observed greater leaf breakdown in litter bags with coarse   mesh, indicating the importance of scrapers, but potentially also   microbes. However, leaf-associated invertebrates (averaged across both   types of lakes) had low densities (4.7 ind.g(-1)), biomass (8.3mgg(-1))   and richness (12 taxa), which may explain similar breakdown rates   between lakes. Semi-aquatic Coleoptera and Mollusca were the most   diverse taxa because they are capable of tolerating high hydrological   stress associated with shallow lakes in semiarid areas. Planorbidae,   which are intermediate hosts for the human parasitic trematode   Schistosomamansoni, were almost absent in the macrophytic lake,   suggesting that macrophytes may reduce the Planorbidae density and play   an important role in human health.",1111,N,ER,,,

Arthropods and plants were surveyed sequentially   in each plot within each field. Most arthropods were identified to   family and each taxon was classified into one of the following feeding   groups: chewing-herbivores, flower-consumers, omnivores, saprophages,   sucking-herbivores, parasitoids, and predators. Plant species were   classified into three functional groups (grasses, forbs and legumes)   which represent highly distinct resources for the arthropods.   The farming system had a significant impact on the abundance and   richness of grasses, forbs and legumes. In turn, the plant community,   mainly conditioned by the farming system, affected the entire community   of arthropods, indicating that small-scale plant community   characteristics must be taken into account in order to achieve a better   comprehension of the arthropod's response to the farming system.   There is still no clear perception of the importance of weeds in arable   ecosystems, but the role of legumes in enhancing the richness of   saprophages, parasitoids and predators underlines the importance of   investigating further cropping systems that combine crop production with   the maintenance of essential ecosystem services.

Rhizosphere bacteria live in close contact to plant roots feeding on   root exudates and rhizodeposits. By producing toxic exoproducts   rhizobacteria may inhibit plant pathogens thereby functioning as   biocontrol agents and increasing plant fitness. However, the   evolutionary basis why rhizobacteria protect plants is little   understood. To persist toxin production needs to improve the   competitiveness of the bacteria themselves.   2. We investigated the importance of secondary metabolite production for   the establishment of the model soil biocontrol bacterium Pseudomonas   fluorescens CHA0 in the rhizosphere of rice. We compared the performance   of this toxin-producing strain and its isogenic gacS deficient mutant   defective in secondary metabolite production. The bacteria were added to   the rhizosphere of rice, where they had to compete with the indigenous   flora for resources and to resist predation by the protist Acanthamoeba   castellanii.   3. Secondary metabolite production strongly enhanced the establishment   of the inoculated bacteria by improving competitive strength and   predator resistance. The fitness gain due to attenuation of predation   exceeded that due to competition by a factor of 2-3, confirming the   importance of grazing resistance for rhizosphere bacteria.   4.

Non-pesticidal control methods for D. citri remain a high   priority for the citrus industry. While searching for semiochemicals   that may be involved in orientation to host plants, we previously   identified a blend of formic and acetic acids that stimulated substrate   probing by D. citri. Here, we applied geometric mixture designs and   response surface modeling to identify and optimize a 3-component blend   that further increased the number of salivary sheaths produced by D.   citri on a wax substrate containing a 3.5:1.6:1 blend of formic acid,   acetic acid, and p-cymene, respectively. No evidence was found for   remote orientation by D. citri adults through olfaction to the   phagostimulant blends. Increased probing in response to the presence of   phagostimulants in the wax matrix occurred after contact with the   substrate. Yellow wax beads always attracted more D. citri adults and   received more probes compared with white wax beads. Yellow beads   containing the 3-component blend of phagostimulants were probed by D.   citri 2 to 3 times more often compared with yellow beads alone. The   phagostimulant effect also was tested by covering wax beads containing   the 3-component blend with a plastic film to minimize olfaction or   contact chemoreception by antennation. The plastic film did not affect   the probing response, thus suggesting that chemosensation was associated   with mouthparts and not olfactory receptors. Salivary sheaths produced   in wax beads containing the phagostimulant blend were 4.5 times longer   than sheaths produced in beads without tastants.

Although coral reefs are the aquatic analogues of   tropical forests, the Janzen-Connell model has never been proposed as an   explanation for high diversity in these ecosystems. We tested the   central predictions of the Janzen-Connell model in a coral reef, using   swimming larvae and settled polyps of the common Caribbean coral   Montastraea faveolata. In a field experiment to test for distance- or   density-dependent mortality, coral settler mortality was higher and more   strongly density dependent in locations down-current from adult corals.   Survival did not increase monotonically with distance, however,   revealing the influence of fluid dynamics around adult corals in   structuring spatial patterns of mortality. Complementary microbial   profiles around adult coral heads revealed that one potential cause of   settler mortality, marine microbial communities, are structured at the   same spatial scale. In a field experiment to test whether factors   causing juvenile mortality are host specific, settler mortality was   2.3-3.0 times higher near conspecific adults vs. near adult corals of   other genera or in open reef areas. In four laboratory experiments to   test for distance-dependent, host-specific mortality, swimming coral   larvae were exposed to water collected near conspecific adult corals,   near other coral genera, and in open areas of the reef. Microbial   abundance in these water samples was manipulated with filters and   antibiotics to test whether the cause of mortality was biotic (i.e.,   microbial). Juvenile survivorship was lowest in unfiltered water   collected near conspecifics, and survivorship increased when this water   was filter sterilized, collected farther away, or collected near other   adult coral genera. Together these results demonstrate for the first   time that the diversity-promoting mechanisms embodied in the   Janzen-Connell model can operate in a marine ecosystem and in an animal.   The distribution of adult corals across a reef will thus influence the   spatial pattern of juvenile survival. When rare coral species have a   survival advantage, coral species diversity per se becomes increasingly   important for the persistence and recovery of coral cover on tropical   reefs.",1115,N,ER,,,

Conservation tillage enhanced soil fertility and pest control,   decreased water quality regulation and weed control, without affecting   crop production and disease control. Fertilization only influenced crop   production by increasing grain yield. Landscape intensification reduced   the provision of disease and pest control.

Adaptation   studies of forestry practices have focused on maintaining the   provisioning of ecosystem services; however, those practices may have   implications for climate change mitigation as well by increasing   biological sinks or reducing emissions. Assessments of the effectiveness   of adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change are therefore   needed; however, they have not been done for the world's northern   coniferous forests. Diversifying the forest by planting tree species   more likely suited to a future climate is a potential adaptation   strategy to increase resilience. The efficacy of this strategy to reduce   the risks of climate change is uncertain, and other ecosystem services   provided by the forest are also likely to be affected. We used a   spatially explicit forest landscape modeling framework (LANDIS-II) to   simulate the effects of planting a range of native tree species in   colder areas than where they are currently planted in a managed   temperate coniferous forest landscape in British Columbia, Canada. We   investigated impacts on carbon pools, fluxes, tree species diversity,   and harvest levels under different climate scenarios for 100 yr   (2015-2115) and found that the capacity of our forest landscape to   sequester carbon would largely depend on the precipitation rates in the   future, rather than on temperature. We further found that, irrespective   of the climate prediction model, current planting standards led to   relatively low levels of resilience as indicated by carbon fluxes and   stocks, net primary productivity (NPP), and species diversity. In   contrast, planting a mix of alternative tree species was generally   superior in increasing the resilience indicators: carbon stocks and   fluxes, NPP, and tree species diversity, but not harvest rates. The   second best novel planting regime involved adding Pinus contorta to the   stocking standard in three ecoregions; however, that species is   susceptible to a high number of insects and pathogens.

The molecular   determinants of V. nigripulchritudo pathogenicity are unknown; however,   molecular epidemiological studies have suggested that pathogenicity is   linked to particular lineages. Here, we performed high-throughput   sequencing-based comparative genome analysis of 16 V. nigripulchritudo   strains to explore the genomic diversity and evolutionary history of   pathogen-containing lineages and to identify pathogen-specific genetic   elements. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed three pathogen-containing   V. nigripulchritudo clades, including two clades previously identified   from New Caledonia and one novel clade comprising putatively pathogenic   isolates from septicemic shrimp in Madagascar. The similar genetic   distance between the three clades indicates that they have diverged from   an ancestral population roughly at the same time and recombination   analysis indicates that these genomes have, in the past, shared a common   gene pool and exchanged genes. As each contemporary lineage is comprised   of nearly identical strains, comparative genomics allowed   differentiation of genetic elements specific to shrimp pathogenesis of   varying severity. Notably, only a large plasmid present in all highly   pathogenic (HP) strains encodes a toxin. Although less/non-pathogenic   strains contain related plasmids, these are differentiated by a putative   toxin locus. Expression of this gene by a non-pathogenic V.   nigripulchritudo strain resulted in production of toxic culture   supernatant, normally an exclusive feature of HP strains. Thus, this   protein, here termed `nigritoxin', is implicated to an extent that   remains to be precisely determined in the toxicity of V.   nigripulchritudo.",1119,n,ER,,,

Behavioural changes of prey are some of the most   rapid responses to predator decline and may act as an early indicator of   cascading effects. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), an apex   predator, is undergoing progressive and extensive population decline, of   more than 90\% in long-diseased areas, caused by a novel disease. Time   since local disease outbreak correlates with devil population declines   and thus predation risk. We used hair traps and giving-up densities   (GUDs) in food patches to test whether a major prey species of devils,   the arboreal common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), is   responsive to the changing risk of predation when they forage on the   ground. Possums spend more time on the ground, discover food patches   faster and forage more to a lower GUD with increasing years since   disease outbreak and greater devil population decline. Loss of top-down   effects of devils with respect to predation risk was evident at 90\%   devil population decline, with possum behaviour indistinguishable from a   devil-free island.

The deep reef refugia hypothesis posits that   light-dependent stony coral species at deeper depths are buffered from   thermal stress and will avoid bleaching-related mass mortalities caused   by increasing sea surface temperatures under climate change. This   hypothesis has not been tested because data collection on deeper coral   reefs is difficult. Here we show that deeper (mesophotic) reefs, 30-75m   depth, in the Caribbean are not refugia because they have lower   bleaching threshold temperatures than shallow reefs. Over two thermal   stress events, mesophotic reef bleaching was driven by a bleaching   threshold that declines 0.26 degrees C every +10m depth. Thus, the main   premise of the deep reef refugia hypothesis that cooler environments are   protective is incorrect; any increase in temperatures above the local   mean warmest conditions can lead to thermal stress and bleaching.

We exposed wild mustard as phytometer   plants in two cropland habitat types (wheat field, field margin) and   three noncrop habitat types (fallow, grassland, wood margin) across   eight landscapes along a gradient from simple to complex (quantified as   \% arable land). Both landscape and local factors affected the abundance   of rape pollen beetles and parasitoids. Rape pollen beetle infestation   and parasitism rates on these plants were lower in noncrop habitats and   higher in wheat fields and field margins, whereas beetles and   parasitoids responded differently to landscape scale parameters. We   found the hypothesized spillover from OSR crop onto wild plants in   surrounding habitats only for parasitoids, but not for pollen beetles.   Parasitism rates were not related to landscape simplification, but   benefited from increasing proportions of OSR. In contrast, rape pollen   beetles benefited from simple landscape structures, presumably due to   multi-annual population build-ups resulting from long-term OSR planting   (as part of the crop rotation).

In an experiment,   well-fed hosts died faster and produced more parasites than did   austerely fed ones. This resource-dependent variation in virulence and   other experimental results (involving growth and reproduction   rate/timing of hosts) readily emerged from a model based on dynamic   energy budgets. This model follows energy flow through the host, from   ingestion of food, to internal energy storage, to allocation toward   growth and reproduction or to a parasite that consumes these reserves.   Acting as a consumer, the parasite catalyzes its own extinction,   persistence with an energetically compromised host, or death of the   host. In this last case, more resources for the host inadvertently fuels   faster parasite growth, thereby accelerating the demise of the host   (although the opposite result arises with different resource kinetics of   the parasite). Thus, this model can explain how resource supply drives   variation in virulence. This ecological dependence of virulence likely   rivals and/or interacts with genetic mechanisms that often garner more   attention in the literature on disease.",1125,N,ER,,,

One type   was isolated from the digestate of a biogas production reactor fed with   kitchen wastes. The second type was obtained from a compost made from a   mix of biogas digestate, gardening residues and sewage sludge. The   results demonstrate that the alkaline hydrolysate exhibited the   following effects: (i) decreased the necrosis development by L maculans   by 42-56\% when applied to leaves and by 31-37\% when applied to roots;   (ii) reduced cotyledon leaf area by 13-17\%; (iii) increased biomass dry   weight by 9\% compared to the distilled-water-treated control.

We assessed the diversity and assemblage structure of   hymenopteran parasitoids in fragments of native scrubland (fynbos)   within vineyard landscapes in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa.   We also aimed to detect positive effects of adjacent fynbos on vineyard   parasitoids, such as elevated diversity at vineyard edges adjoining   fynbos or evidence of parasitoid spillover into vineyards. Fynbos   remnants had significantly higher parasitoid abundance and richness than   neighboring vineyards, and supported assemblages distinct from those   within vineyards. Parasitoid diversity in vineyards was not influenced   by distance to remnant vegetation. Additionally, evidence for spillover   was limited, as there were abrupt changes in assemblage structure at   fynbos/vineyard boundaries. Surrounding vineyards therefore seem to have   an isolating effect on parasitoids in remnants. This emphasises the need   to increase the permeability of the vineyard matrix. Yet, our results   show that remnants are important for retaining parasitoid diversity and   provide refugia for certain species within the disturbed agricultural   environment. Approaches that combine natural remnant conservation with   arthropod-friendly activities in vineyards would be an effective way to   support diverse and functional parasitoid assemblages at the landscape   scale.

We found that infestation by the gall midge M. fagi   and the pathogenic fungus S. tulasnei significantly changed the chemical   quality of beech and maple litter. Changes in element concentrations   were generally positive and more pronounced, and if negative less   pronounced for maple than beech litter most likely due to high quality   fungal tissue remaining on litter after abscission. More importantly,   alterations in litter chemical quality did not translate to distinct   patterns of carbon mineralization at ambient conditions, but even low   amounts of infested litter accelerated carbon mineralization at   moderately increased soil moisture and in particular at higher   temperature. Our results indicate that insect herbivores and fungal   pathogens can markedly alter initial litter chemical quality, but that   afterlife effects on carbon mineralization depend on soil moisture and   temperature, suggesting that increased infestation severity under   projected climate change potentially increases soil carbon release in   deciduous forests in Central Europe.

Methods   We measured pathogen-induced floristic change along a disease   chronosequence, and re-sampled historic quadrats in Banksia attenuata   woodlands of the SWAFR. The chronosequence represents three disease   stages: (1) healthy vegetation with no disease expression; (2) the   active disease front; and (3) diseased vegetation infected for at least   15 years.

Results   beta-diversity differed substantially for both chronosequence and   historic data, while alpha-diversity was maintained, as measured by plot   species richness and Simpson's reciprocal index.

Typically, ecologists focus on limitation by N and P. However, other   nutrients can limit growth or reproduction. Here we focus on K   limitation of invertebrate consumers (Daphnia dentifera) and   phytoplankton in freshwater lakes. All organisms require K for several   metabolic processes. In freshwater, K could limit growth because low   external concentrations can increase the energetic costs of accumulating   K. Furthermore, in a study linking K to disease, we previously found   that K enrichment of water from one low-K lake stimulated the growth and   reproduction of Daphnia. Here we test whether K could limit the   production of Daphnia and phytoplankton across lakes and years. We   repeated a life table experiment using water collected from a low-K lake   during a different year. K again stimulated Daphnia reproduction. We   also enriched water from 12 lakes with K or P and measured short-term   growth of Daphnia and the resident algal community. Both nutrients   increased Daphnia growth in five lakes. However, only P enhanced algal   production. P stimulation of Daphnia positively correlated with algal   quantity and the ratio of C to P in seston.

Ecologists increasingly report the structures of metacommunities for   free-living species, yet far less is known about the composition of   symbiont communities through space and time. Understanding the drivers   of symbiont community patterns has implications ranging from emerging   infectious disease to managing host microbiomes.   2. Using symbiont communities from amphibian hosts sampled from wetlands   of California, USA, we quantified the effects of spatial structure,   habitat filtering and host community components on symbiont occupancy   and overall metacommunity structure.   3. We built upon a statistical method to describe metacommunity   structure that accounts for imperfect detection in survey data-detection   error-corrected elements of metacommunity structure-by adding an   analysis to identify covariates of community turnover. We applied our   model to a metacommunity of eight parasite taxa observed in 3,571   Pacific chorus frogs (Pseudacris regilla) surveyed from 174 wetlands   over 5 years.   4. Symbiont metacommunity structure varied across years, showing nested   structure in 3 years and random structure in 2 years. Species turnover   was most consistently influenced by spatial and host community   components. Occupancy generally increased in more southeastern wetlands,   and snail (intermediate host) community composition had strong effects   on most symbiont taxa.   5. We have used sophisticated but accessible statistical methods to   reveal that spatial components-which influence colonization-and host   community composition-which mediates transmission-both drive symbiont   community composition in this system. These methods allow us to   associate broad patterns of community turnover to local, species-level   effects, ultimately improving our understanding of spatial community   dynamics.",1136,N,ER,,,

Social insects, typified by crowding and   often by low genetic variation, have high probabilities of disease   transmission and eusocial Hymenoptera may be particularly vulnerable   because of haplodiploidy. Mechanisms they employ to reduce the risk of   disease include antimicrobial secretions which are particularly   important primary barriers to infection. However, until now, whether or   not there is selection for stronger antimicrobial secretions when the   risk of disease increases because of sociality has not been tested.   Here, we present evidence that the production of progressively stronger   antimicrobial compounds was critical to the evolution of sociality in   bees. We found that increases in group size and genetic relatedness were   strongly correlated with increasing antimicrobial strength. The   antimicrobials of even the most primitive semi-social species were an   order of magnitude stronger that those of solitary species, suggesting a   point of no return, beyond which disease control was essential.

By   performing metaproteomics for the first time on haloarchaea, genomic   variation of S-layer, archaella and other cell surface proteins was   linked to mechanisms of infection evasion. CRISPR defense systems were   found to be active, with haloarchaea responding to at least eight   distinct types of viruses, including those infecting between genera.

Current thinking holds that wood density mediates a tradeoff   between strength and economy of construction, with higher wood density   providing higher strength but at higher cost.   2. Yet the further away wood fibres are from the central axis of the   trunk, the more they increase the strength of the trunk; thus, a fat   trunk of low-density wood can achieve greater strength at lower   construction cost than a thin trunk of high-density wood.   3. What then are the countervailing advantages of high wood density?   4. We hypothesize that high wood density is associated with lower   maintenance costs due to lower trunk surface area, as surface area   correlates with maintenance respiration.   5. This advantage would be particularly important to long-lived trees   and could in part explain why they tend to have high wood density.   6. High wood density has also been associated with lower risk of trunk   breakage, xylem implosion and pathogen invasion, but we argue that these   relationships are not causal and instead reflect correlated selection on   other traits of value to long-lived trees.   7.

Plants can disperse faster than most soil biota, however,   little is known about how range-expanding plants in the new range will   establish interactions with the resident soil food web. In this paper we   examine how the soil nematode community from the new range responds to   range-expanding plant species compared to related natives. We focused on   nematodes, because they are important components in various trophic   levels of the soil food web, some feeding on plant roots, others on   microbes or on invertebrates. We expected that range expanding plant   species have fewer root-feeding nematodes, as predicted by enemy release   hypothesis. We therefore expected that range expanders affect the   taxonomic and functional composition of the nematode community, but that   these effects would diminish with increasing trophic position of   nematodes in the soil food web.   We exposed six range expanders (including three intercontinental   exotics) and nine related native plant species to soil from the invaded   range and show that range expanders on average had fewer root-feeding   nematodes per unit root biomass than related natives. The range   expanders showed resistance against rather than tolerance for   root-feeding nematodes from the new range. On the other hand, the   overall taxonomic and functional nematode community composition was   influenced by plant species rather than by plant origin. The plant   identity effects declined with trophic position of nematodes in the soil   food web, as plant feeders were influenced more than other feeding   guilds. We conclude that range-expanding plant species can have fewer   root-feeding nematodes per unit root biomass than related natives, but   that the taxonomic and functional nematode community composition is   determined more by plant identity than by plant origin.

We also inferred   potential effects of observed community changes for increased   transmission risk of Puumala virus (PUUV) spread, causing the zoonotic   disease nephropatica epidemica in humans. Analyses were based on   long-term (1971-2013) monitoring data of shrews and voles representing   58 time series in northern Sweden. We calculated richness, diversity,   and evenness at alpha, beta, and gamma level, partitioned beta diversity   into turnover (species replacement) and nestedness (species   addition/removal), used similarity percentages (SIMPER) analysis to   assess community structure, and calculated the cumulated number of   PUUV-infected bank voles and average PUUV prevalence (percentage of   infected bank voles) per vole cycle. Alpha, beta, and gamma richness and   diversity of voles, but not shrews, showed long-term trends that varied   spatially. The observed patterns were associated with an increase in   community contribution of bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a decrease of   gray-sided vole (M.rufocanus) and field vole (Microtus agrestis) and a   hump-shaped variation in contribution of common shrew (Sorex araneus).   Long-term biodiversity changes were largely related to changes in forest   landscape structure. Number of PUUV-infected bank voles in spring was   negatively related to beta and gamma diversity, and positively related   to turnover of shrews (replaced by voles) and to community contribution   of bank voles. The latter was also positively related to average PUUV   prevalence in spring. We showed that long-term changes in the boreal   landscape contributed to explain the decrease in biodiversity and the   change in structure of small mammal communities. In addition, our   results suggest decrease in small mammal diversity to have knock-on   effects on dynamics of infectious diseases among small mammals with   potential implications for disease transmission to humans.",1144,N,ER,,,

A   laboratory study was conducted to investigate the removal of three   indicator organisms (Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and   F-RNA coliphages) by biofilters. The influence of a range of factors was   investigated: presence of vegetation, depth and types of filter media,   presence of a saturated zone at the base of the biofilter, and   intermittent wetting and drying conditions. The mean removal of C.   perfringens and F-RNA coliphages by all biofilter designs exceeded 3   log. E. coli removal during wet periods, however, was much lower (mean 2   log). Furthermore, antecedent drying decreased the E. coli removal   efficiency significantly (p < 0.05). Drying might induce fine fissures   or macropore formation in filter media thus reduced retention of   microbes.

Information on the   dynamics of benthic viruses and their interactions with prokaryotes in   mud volcano ecosystems is still completely lacking. We investigated the   impact of viral infection on the mortality and assemblage structure of   benthic prokaryotes of five mud volcanoes in the Mediterranean Sea. Mud   volcano sediments promote high rates of viral production (1.65-7.89 x   10(9) viruses g(-1) d(-1)), viral-induced prokaryotic mortality (VIPM)   (33\% cells killed per day) and heterotrophic prokaryotic production   (3.0-8.3 mu gC g(-1) d(-1)) when compared with sediments outside the mud   volcano area. The viral shunt (that is, the microbial biomass converted   into dissolved organic matter as a result of viral infection, and thus   diverted away from higher trophic levels) provides 49 mgC m(-2) d(-1),   thus fuelling the metabolism of uninfected prokaryotes and contributing   to the total C budget. Bacteria are the dominant components of   prokaryotic assemblages in surface sediments of mud volcanoes, whereas   archaea dominate the subsurface sediment layers. Multivariate multiple   regression analyses show that prokaryotic assemblage composition is not   only dependant on the geochemical features and processes of mud volcano   ecosystems but also on synergistic interactions between bottom-up (that   is, trophic resources) and top-down (that is, VIPM) controlling factors.

Both parasites and predators are   important factors shaping community structure and species composition of   ecosystems. Here, we simultaneously exposed Daphnia magna to predator   cues (released by the tadpole shrimp, Triops, or by a fish) and spores   of the yeast parasite Metschnikowia sp. to determine how life history   and morphological inducible defences against these two contrasting types   of predators are affected by infection.   Results: The parasite suppressed some Triops-induced defences: Daphnia   lost the ability to produce a greater number of larger offspring, a   life-history adaptation to Triops predation. In contrast, the parasite   did not suppress inducible defences against fish: induction (resulting   in smaller body length of the mothers as well as of their offspring) and   infection acted additively on the measured traits. Thus, fish-induced   defences may be less costly than inducible defences against small   invertebrate predators like Triops; the latter defences could no longer   be expressed when the host had already invested in fighting off the   parasite.   Conclusions: In summary, our study suggests that as specific inducible   defences differ in their costs, some might be suppressed if a target   prey is additionally infected. Therefore, adding parasite pressure to   predator-prey systems can help to elucidate the costs of inducible   defences.",1151,N,ER,,,

A recent model of 5 geographically separated   populations of Cerulean Warblers (Dendroica cerulea) that was based on   within-season sampling of nest survival and fledgling success shows that   all populations are sinks (annual reproduction is consistently less than   annual adult mortality). I tested this indirect model by directly   measuring fecundity (number of female fledglings/female) during the   breeding season for 2 years in a Cerulean Warbler population occupying a   mature forest in southwestern Michigan (U.S.A.) I determined territories   of male birds on the basis of male plumage characters and phases of the   nesting cycle (2007) and on uniquely color-banded males (2008). I   transferred locations of identified males to topographic maps. I counted   all fledglings in territories from May to July each year. The model I   tested may apply only to single-brooded species; therefore, I searched   the literature to estimate the percentage of single-brooded species in   North America. The breeding season of Cerulean Warblers was short nearly   all nests were initiated from mid-May to late June. Nest predation and   brood parasitism were primary and rare causes of nest failure,   respectively. Significantly fewer Cerulean Warblers fledged from   parasitized than from nonparasitized nests. Fledgling survival required   to maintain the population size was well above previously published   values for Neotropical migrants. Single-brooded species comprise 62\% of   North American breeding bird species for which the number of broods per   year is known; I believe my results may apply to these species. The   consistency between identification of populations as sources or sinks on   the basis of either model estimates or direct measurements suggests that   a demographic model relying on within-season sampling of fecundity is   adequate to determine population status of single-brooded avian   populations. In addition, on the basis of results of previous studies,   annual adult survival rate of the Cerulean Warbler is typical of parulid   warblers that are not declining.

In fact, historical evidence indicates that long-term climate changes   have destabilized civilizations and caused population collapses via food   shortages, diseases, and wars. One of the worst population collapses of   human societies occurred during the early fourteenth century in northern   Europe; the Great Famine was the consequence of the dramatic effects of   climate deterioration on human population growth. Thus, part of my   motivation was to demonstrate that simple theoretical-based models can   be helpful in understanding the causes of population change in   preindustrial societies. Here, the results suggest that a logistic model   with temperature as a lateral perturbation effect is the key element for   explaining the population collapse exhibited by the European population   during the Great Famine.",1153,N,ER,,,

Mitchell",2016,Joint effects of nutrient addition and enemy exclusion on exotic plant   success,ECOLOGY,3337-3345,3337-3345,10.1002/ecy.1585,"Worldwide, ecosystems are increasingly dominated by exotic plant   species, a shift hypothesized to result from numerous ecological   factors. Two of these, increased resource availability and enemy   release, may act in concert to increase exotic success in plant   communities (Resource-Enemy Release Hypothesis, R-ERH). To test this, we   manipulated the availability of soil nutrients and access of vertebrate   herbivores, insect herbivores, and fungal pathogens to intact grassland   communities containing both native and exotic species. Our results   supported both conditions necessary for R-ERH. First, exotics were less   damaged than natives, experiencing less foliar damage (insect herbivory   and fungal disease) than native species, particularly in communities   where soil nutrients were added. Second, fertilization increased foliar   damage on native species, but not exotic species. As well as fulfilling   both conditions for R-ERH, these results demonstrate the importance of   considering the effects of resource availability when testing for enemy   release. When both conditions are fulfilled, R-ERH predicts that   increasing resource availability will increase exotic abundance only in   the presence of enemies. Our results fully supported this prediction for   vertebrate herbivores: fertilization increased exotic cover only in   communities exposed to vertebrate herbivores. Additionally, the   prediction was partially supported for insect herbivores and fungal   pathogens, excluding these enemies reduced exotic cover as predicted,   but inconsistent with R-ERH, this effect occurred only in unfertilized   communities. These results highlight the need to consider the influence   of multiple enemy guilds on community processes like exotic plant   invasions. Moreover, this study experimentally demonstrates that   resource availability and natural enemies can jointly influence exotic   success in plant communities.",1154,N,ER,,,

Kobe",2010,Conspecific plant-soil feedbacks reduce survivorship and growth of   tropical tree seedlings,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,396-407,396-407,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01619.x,"1. The Janzen-Connell (J-C) Model proposes that host-specific enemies   maintain high tree species diversity by reducing seedling performance   near conspecific adults and promoting replacement by heterospecific   seedlings. Support for this model often comes from decreased performance   for a species at near versus far distances from conspecific adults.   However, the relative success of conspecific versus heterospecific   seedlings recruiting under a given tree species is a critical, but   untested, component of the J-C Model.   2. In a shade-house experiment, we tested plant-soil feedbacks as a J-C   mechanism in six tropical tree species. We assessed effects of   conspecific versus heterospecific cultured soil extracts on seedling   performance for each species, and we compared performance of conspecific   versus heterospecific seedlings grown with soil extract cultured by a   particular tree species. Additionally, we tested whether soil microbes   were creating these plant-soil feedbacks and whether low light increased   species vulnerability to pathogens.   3. Among 30 potential comparisons of survival and mass for seedlings   grown in conspecific versus heterospecific soil extracts, survival   decreased in seven and increased in two, whereas mass decreased in 13   and increased in 1. To integrate survival and growth, we also examined   seedling performance [(mean total mass x mean survival time)/(days of   experiment)], which was lower in 16 and higher in 2 of 30 comparisons   between seedlings grown with soil extract cultured by conspecific versus   heterospecific individuals. Based on performance within a soil extract,   conspecific seedlings were disadvantaged in 15 and favoured in 7 of 30   cases relative to heterospecific seedlings.   4. Species pairwise interactions of soil modification and seedling   performance occurred regardless of sterilization, suggesting chemical   mediation. Microbes lacked host-specificity and reduced performance   regardless of extract source and irradiance.   5. Synthesis. These results, along with parallel research in temperate   forests, suggest that plant-soil feedbacks are an important component of   seedling dynamics in both ecosystems. However, negative conspecific   feedbacks were more prevalent in tropical than temperate species. Thus,   negative plant-soil feedbacks appear to facilitate species coexistence   via negative distance-dependent processes in tropical but not temperate   forests, but the feedbacks were mediated through chemical effects rather   than through natural enemies as expected under the J-C Model.",1155,N,ER,,,

One such pathogen, the causal   agent of the devastating ash dieback in Europe, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus,   was most likely introduced into Europe from eastern Asia in the 1990s.   To investigate the genetic population structure of this invasive fungus   at the epidemic disease front (Switzerland) and in the post-epidemic   phase (Lithuania), a total of 847 H. fraxineus isolates were genotyped   at 11 microsatellite loci. Among these isolates, 244 multilocus   genotypes were found in five post-epidemic subpopulations (367 isolates)   of the fungus and 263 in five epidemic subpopulations (480 isolates). No   genetic differentiation was found between isolates recovered from bark   lesions and fallen leaf petioles, which suggests that all H. fraxineus   genotypes have the potential to induce bark infections on living trees   and to survive saprophytically. Moreover, no genetic differentiation and   no difference in genetic diversity were detected between the epidemic   and post-epidemic populations. The entire genetic diversity present in   the original founding populations in north-eastern Europe seems to have   been transmitted to the epidemic disease front. Nonetheless, gene flow   among post-epidemic subpopulations occurs slightly more random than   among epidemic subpopulations. Furthermore, the probability of correct   assignment of a particular H. fraxineus genotype to its subpopulation of   origin was greater in Switzerland than in Lithuania. These two analyses   point to weak founder effects at the disease front.",1156,N,ER,,,

Climate-associated changes in forest composition have been widely   reported, particularly where changes in abiotic conditions have resulted   in high mortality of sensitive species and have disproportionately   favoured certain species better adapted to these newer conditions. In   the north-eastern USA and south-eastern Canada, few studies have   examined climate-related influences associated with forest composition,   and none have considered broad-scale changes over a long temporal (>25   years) period.   2. We used US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data from   1983 to 2014 across four north-eastern states (Maine, New Hampshire, New   York and Vermont) to assess temporal and spatial changes in the   occurrence and abundance of American beech Fagus grandifolia Ehrh, sugar   maple Acer saccharum L., red maple Acer rubrum L. and birch Betula spp.   saplings. We also tested the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on   the distribution of the four studied deciduous species over the entire   period examined.   3. Occurrence and abundance of American beech have increased   substantially over the past three decades, whereas the occurrence and   abundance of three other deciduous species have decreased in all   ecological provinces of the north-eastern USA, except the Midwest   Broadleaf ecological province. Consequently, a clear shift in species   composition is currently underway in the beech-maple-birch (BMB) forests   of the north-eastern USA, with uncertain consequences for future   ecosystem structure and function.   4. In the studied region and over the entire period examined, the   distribution of increased occurrence and abundance of beech relative to   the three other deciduous species were associated with higher   temperature and precipitation as well as higher conspecific basal area   and dead tree basal area.   5. Synthesis and applications. The change from beech-maple-birch forests   to more beech-dominated forests with beech encroachment to new forest   areas across the north-eastern USA may continue if higher intensity   harvesting and disturbances (i.e. large-scale canopy openings) do not   occur. This would be a significant management concern as beech is   associated with a widespread bark disease, is commercially less   desirable, and can limit natural regeneration from other species. Our   results emphasize the need for management strategies such as higher   intensity harvesting methods, vegetation control and limiting browsing   pressure to reduce beech dominance.",1157,N,ER,,,

However, due to the unique endemic   disease associated with arsenic (As) contamination in Taiwan, a recent   research was re-initiated to understand the transport behavior of   arsenic in a localized alluvial plain. A comprehensive approach towards   arsenic mobility, binding, and chemical speciation was applied to   correlate groundwater hydrogeochemistry with parameters of the sediments   that affected the As fate and transport. The groundwater belongs to a   Na-Ca-HCO3 type with moderate reducing to oxidizing conditions (redox   potential = 192 to 8 mV). Groundwater As concentration in the region   ranged from 8.89 to 1131 mu g/L with a mean of 343 +/- 297 mu g/L, while   the As content in the core sediments varied from 0.80 to 22.8 mg/kg with   a mean of 9.9 +/- 6.2 mg/kg. A significant correlation was found between   As and Fe, Mn, or organic matter, as well as other elements such as Ni,   Cu, Zn, and Co in the core sediments. Sequential extraction analysis   indicated that the organic matter and Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides were the major   binding pools of As.

Various factors that have contributed to the   re-emergence of this infection include disturbances in natural   ecosystems, increase in international transport of animals and humans   and an improvement in diagnostic facilities resulting in better   detection of these infections. Forests are complex natural ecosystems   and home to a wealth of different organisms. They are among the greatest   natural treasures from the perspective of its overall function that   impacts the natural environment and the living conditions within.   Mouse-like rodents that are known natural reservoir for numerous   zoonoses (leptospirosis, tick-borne meningoencephalitis, lyme   borreliosis, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, etc.) form an   important part of forest faunal community. The widespread geographic   distributions of rodents harboring pathogens indicate considerable   disease-causing potential essentially worldwide. The following species   of mouse-like rodents are most common in the continental European   forests: striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius Pall.), yellow-necked   mouse (A. flavicollis Melch.), wood mouse (A. sylvaticus L.), bank vole   (Clethrionomys glareolus Schreib.), common vole (Microtus arvalis   Pall.), field vole (M. agrestis L.), water vole (Arvicola terrestris L.)   and the European pine vole (M. subterraneus de Sel.). The spread of   certain zoonoses is dependent on the abundance of rodent populations,   their distribution, mobility, feeding intensity, habitat conditions and   reproduction potential, as well as the abundance and distribution of   wild and domesticated animals susceptible to infectious disease. A large   number of factors influence the population sizes of mouse-like rodents,   and these can be classified into four basic groups: abundance and   physiological state of the population, meteorological conditions,   habitat and food sources, and natural enemies and diseases. The   population abundance of each species changes in the course of a year or   several years. Years with mild winters, dry springs and summers are   favorable for increases in abundance of these species, which in turn can   contribute to the spread of individual zoonoses in forests. The   objectives of interdisciplinary studies currently ongoing in Croatia are   to define the distribution and genetic diversity of individual causative   agents of certain zoonoses such as leptospirosis, lyme borreliosis and   hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In the same time, the level of   infection among mouse-like rodents as the main reservoirs of these   zoonoses in forest ecosystems is investigating on molecular level.   Establishing the natural fruit-bearing cycle for woody plants is   successfully used in assessing the possible growth in population   numbers. Regular controls of rodent populations and their infectiousness   is significant in planning epidemiological and sanitary measures in   preventing outbreaks of epidemics and individual cases of illness among   animal and human populations (forest workers, excursionists,   mountaineers, soldiers, tourists, etc.).",1159,N,ER,,,

The results showed that all composting piles reached a temperature   greater than 55 degrees C for at least 7days (which meets the   requirements for destroying pathogens), and the maturity times of   composts with low initial C/N ratios were shorter than in composts with   high initial C/N ratios. The nitrogen loss in the composting pile with   initial C/N of 16.3 was significantly higher than the other treatments.   Furthermore, the statistics analysis showed that the initial C/N ratios   of the composts, which varied from 16.3 to 29.6, had a significant   negative linear correlation with the loss of total organic matter (R =   -0.9661) and loss of total nitrogen (R = -0.9365).

Problem statement -Foundation species define and structure ecological   systems. In forests around the world, foundation tree species are   declining due to overexploitation, pests and pathogens. Eastern hemlock   (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation tree species in eastern North America,   is threatened by an exotic insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges   tsugae). The loss of hemlock is hypothesized to result in dramatic   changes in assemblages of associated species with cascading impacts on   food webs and fluxes of energy and nutrients. We describe the setting,   design and analytical framework of the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal   Experiment (HF-HeRE), a multi-hectare, long-term experiment that   overcomes many of the major logistical and analytical challenges of   studying system-wide consequences of foundation species loss.   2. Study design - HF-HeRE is a replicated and blocked   Before-After-Control-Impact experiment that includes two hemlock removal   treatments: girdling all hemlocks to simulate death by adelgid and   logging all hemlocks > 20 cm diameter and other merchantable trees to   simulate pre-emptive salvage operations. These treatments are paired   with two control treatments: hemlock controls that are beginning to be   infested in 2010 by the adelgid and hardwood controls that represent   future conditions of most hemlock stands in eastern North America.   3. Ongoing measurements and monitoring - Ongoing long-term measurements   to quantify the magnitude and direction of forest ecosystem change as   hemlock declines include: air and soil temperature, light availability,   leaf area and canopy closure; changes in species composition and   abundance of the soil seed-bank, understorey vegetation, and   soil-dwelling invertebrates; dynamics of coarse woody debris; soil   nitrogen availability and net nitrogen mineralization; and soil carbon   flux. Short-term or one-time-only measurements include initial tree   ages, hemlock-decomposing fungi, wood-boring beetles and throughfall   chemistry. Additional within-plot, replicated experiments include   effects of ants and litter-dwelling microarthoropods on ecosystem   functioning, and responses of salamanders to canopy change.   4. Future directions and collaborations - HF-HeRE is part of an evolving   network of retrospective studies, natural experiments, large   manipulations and modelling efforts focused on identifying and   understanding the role of single foundation species on ecological   processes and dynamics. We invite colleagues from around the world who   are interested in exploring complementary questions to take advantage of   the HF-HeRE research infrastructure.",1161,Y,ER,no,no data on PP,

In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing of the   bacterial 16S rRNA gene to quantify relationships between building   attributes and airborne bacterial communities at a health-care facility.   We quantified airborne bacterial community structure and environmental   conditions in patient rooms exposed to mechanical or window ventilation   and in outdoor air. The phylogenetic diversity of airborne bacterial   communities was lower indoors than outdoors, and mechanically ventilated   rooms contained less diverse microbial communities than did   window-ventilated rooms. Bacterial communities in indoor environments   contained many taxa that are absent or rare outdoors, including taxa   closely related to potential human pathogens. Building attributes,   specifically the source of ventilation air, airflow rates, relative   humidity and temperature, were correlated with the diversity and   composition of indoor bacterial communities. The relative abundance of   bacteria closely related to human pathogens was higher indoors than   outdoors, and higher in rooms with lower airflow rates and lower   relative humidity.

One consequence of biological invasions is altered   risk of exposure to infectious diseases in human and animal populations.   The distribution and prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases depend on the   complex interactions between the vector, the pathogen, and the human or   wildlife reservoir host. These interactions are highly susceptible to   disturbance by invasive species, including terrestrial plants. We   conducted a 2-year field experiment using a Before-After/Control-Impact   design to examine how removal of invasive Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera   maackii) in a forest fragment embedded within a residential neighborhood   affects the abundance of mosquitoes, including two of the most important   vectors of West Nile virus, Culex pipiens and Cx. restuans. We also   assessed any potential changes in avian communities and local   microclimate associated with Amur honeysuckle removal. We found that (1)   removal of Amur honeysuckle reduces the abundance of both vector and   non-vector mosquito species that commonly feed on human hosts, (2) the   abundance and composition of avian hosts is altered by honeysuckle   removal, and (3) areas invaded with honeysuckle support local   microclimates that are favorable to mosquito survival. Collectively, our   investigations demonstrate the role of a highly invasive understory   shrub in determining the abundance and distribution of mosquitoes and   suggest potential mechanisms underlying this pattern.

Salinity changes have various effects on the   physiology of oysters, potentially altering filtration and respiration   rates, and ultimately impacting growth, reproduction and mortality. We   tested different hypotheses as to how to include these effects in a DEB   model for C. virginica. Specifically, we tested two potential mechanisms   to explain changes in oyster shell growth (cm), tissue dry weight (g)   and gonad dry weight (g) when salinity moves away from the ideal range:   1) a negative effect on filtration rate and 2) an additional somatic   maintenance cost. Comparative simulations of shell growth, dry tissue   biomass and dry gonad weight in two monitored sites in coastal Louisiana   experiencing salinity from 0 to 28 were statistically analyzed to   determine the best hypothesis. Model parameters were estimated through   the covariation method, using literature data and a set of specifically   designed ecophysiological experiments. The model was validated through   independent field studies in estuaries along the northern Gulf of   Mexico.

In grassland ecosystems, competition is a   strong structuring force. Nonetheless, if hemiparasitic plant species   are introduced the competition intensity caused by the dominant species   may be affected. However, the outcome of these interactions may change   between wet or dry periods. In order to study this, we performed a pot   experiment with different densities of the dominant species Schedonorus   arundinaceus (1, 2 or 4 individuals) under constantly moist or   intermittently dry conditions. The different Schenodorus densities were   crossed with presence or absence of hemiparasites (either Rhinanthus   minor or R. alectorolophus). Additionally, pots remained with bare   ground or received a grass litter layer (400 g m(-2)). We expected that   indirect litter effects on vegetation (here Schedonorus or Rhinanthus)   vary depending on soil moisture. We measured Schedonorus and Rhinanthus   aboveground biomass and C stable isotope signature (delta C-13) as   response variables. Overall, Schedonorus attained similar biomass under   moist conditions with Rhinanthus as in pots under dry conditions without   Rhinanthus. Presence of Rhinanthus also increased delta C-13 in moist   pots, indicating hemiparasite-induced water stress. Litter presence   increased Schedonorus biomass and reduced delta C-13, indicating   improved water availability. Plants under dry conditions with litter   showed similar biomass as under wet conditions without litter.   Hemiparasites and litter had opposite effects: hemiparasites reduced   Schedonorus biomass while litter presence facilitated grass growth.   Contrary to our expectations, litter did not compensate Schedonorus   biomass when Rhinanthus was present.",1169,Y,ER,yes,,

The ecological effects of a   half-century or more of flow regulation and sediment alteration are   becoming apparent. What remains of the highly dynamic channel and   riparian ecosystem of the Missouri River described by Lewis and Clark   has become static. Recent long-term studies have determined that some of   the impacts on the Missouri River ecosystem turned out as predicted,   such as the failure of cottonwood-dominated riparian forests to   successfully establish and survive on a broad scale. Other changes were   surprises, such as the effect of disease eliminating a formerly dominant   tree species and the appearance of mainstem and tributary deltas   affecting channel slope, floodplain hydrology, and vegetation.   Restoration of the river's hydrologic and sediment regime has been   delayed long enough that the chances of functional ecosystem restoration   have been greatly reduced and complicated. Two phases are now needed to   attempt to restore the riparian ecosystem: one to repair the effects of   post-dam changes (channel incision, bank stabilization) and another to   reestablish pre-dam flow and sediment regimes. The prospects for   restoration of this valuable ecosystem, rich in history and in goods and   services provided to the public, are dim.

Using a long-term dataset on parasites from desert rodents, we   examined the relative contributions of host traits that represent   important aspects of parasite environment, transmission probability   between host species, and host phylogeny to the structure of a parasite   metacommunity as well as for taxonomically restricted parasite   metacommunities (coccidians, ectoparasites and helminths). This was done   using a combination of metacommunity analysis and variance partitioning   based on canonical correspondence analysis. Coccidian and ectoparasite   metacommunities did not exhibit coherent structure. In contrast,   helminths and the full parasite metacommunity had Clementsian and   quasi-Clementsian structure, respectively, indicating that parasite   species distributions for these metacommunities were compartmentalized   along a dominant gradient. Variance decomposition indicated that   characteristics associated with the host environment consistently   explained more variation than did host traits associated with   transmission opportunities or host phylogeny, indicating that the host   environment is primary in shaping parasite species distributions among   host species. Moreover, the importance of different types of host traits   in structuring parasite metacommunities was consistent among taxonomic   groups (i.e. full metacommunity, coccidians, and helminths) despite   manifest differences in emergent structures (i.e. Clementsian,   quasi-Clementsian, and random) that arose in response to variation in   host environment.",1171,N,ER,,,

Quantifying this role requires   understanding how pathogen abundance in the water and aggregate size   interact to determine the presence and abundance of pathogen cells on   individual aggregates. We build upon current understanding of the   dynamics of bacteria and bacterial grazers on aggregates to develop a   model for the dynamics of a bacterial pathogen species. The model   accounts for the importance of stochasticity and the balance between   colonization and extinction. Simulation results suggest that while   colonization increases linearly with background density and aggregate   size, extinction rates are expected to be nonlinear on small aggregates   in a low background density of the pathogen. Under these conditions, we   predict lower probabilities of pathogen presence and reduced abundance   on aggregates compared with predictions based solely on colonization.   These results suggest that the importance of aggregates to the dynamics   of aquatic bacterial pathogens may be dependent on the interaction   between aggregate size and background pathogen density, and that these   interactions are strongly influenced by ecological interactions and   pathogen traits. The model provides testable predictions and can be a   useful tool for exploring how species-specific differences in pathogen   traits may alter the effect of aggregates on disease transmission.",1172,N,ER,,,

One   candidate mechanism for the maintenance of this diversity is that   differential responses among herbivore species result in a net fitness   balance across plant chemotypes. Such top-down differential selection   would be promoted by consistent responses of herbivores to   glucosinolates, temporal variation in herbivore abundance, and fitness   impacts of herbivore attack on plants varying in glucosinolate profile.   A 1-year survey across 12 wild cabbage populations demonstrated   differential responses of herbivores to glucosinolates. We extended this   survey to investigate the temporal consistency of these responses, and   the extent of variation in abundance of key herbivores. Within plant   populations, the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae consistently preferred   plants producing the glucosinolate progoitrin. Among populations,   increasing frequencies of sinigrin production correlated positively with   herbivory by whitefly Aleyrodes proletella and negatively with herbivory   by snails. Two Pieris butterfly species showed no consistent response to   glucosinolates among years. Rates of herbivory varied significantly   among years within populations, but the frequency of herbivory at the   population scale varied only for B. brassicae. B. brassicae emerges as a   strong candidate herbivore to impose differential selection on   glucosinolates, as it satisfies the key assumptions of consistent   preferences and heterogeneity in abundance. We show that variation in   plant secondary metabolites structures the local herbivore community and   that, for some key species, this structuring is consistent over time. We   discuss the implications of these patterns for the maintenance of   diversity in plant defence chemistry.",1173,N,ER,,,

Small-scale experiments   suggest potential ecosystem responses to losses of species, but   definitive conclusions require verification at larger scales. We   measured ecosystem metabolism and used whole-ecosystem stable isotope   tracer additions to quantify nitrogen cycling in a tropical headwater   stream before and after the sudden loss of amphibians to the fungal   pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Tadpoles are normally dominant   grazers in such streams, where greater than 18 species may co-occur and   densities often exceed 50 individuals m(-2). Loss of 98\% of tadpole   biomass corresponded with greater than 2x increases in algae and fine   detritus biomass in the stream and a greater than 50\% reduction in   nitrogen uptake rate. Nitrogen turnover rates in suspended and deposited   organic sediments were also significantly lower after the decline. As a   consequence, the stream cycled nitrogen less rapidly, and downstream   exports of particulate N were reduced. Whole stream respiration was   significantly lower following the decline, indicating less biological   activity in the stream sediments. Contrary to our predictions, biomass   of grazing invertebrates, or any invertebrate functional groups, did not   increase over 2 years following loss of tadpoles. Thus, reductions in   ecosystem processes linked to the amphibian decline were not compensated   for by other, functionally redundant consumers.

Since 1996/1998 live coral cover in the Gulf declined by over 90\% in   many areas, primarily due to bleaching and diseases caused by rising   temperatures. In the formerly dominant table-coral species A. downingi,   population dynamics corresponding to disturbance regimes was quantified   in three transition matrices (lower disturbance pre-1996; moderate   disturbance from 1998 to 2010 and 2013 to 2017, disturbed in 1996/1998,   2010/11/12, 2017). Increased disturbance frequency and severity caused   progressive reduction in coral size, cover, and population fecundity.   Small size-classes were bolstered more by partial colony mortality than   sexual recruitment. Some large corals had a size refuge and resisted   die-back but were also lost with increasing disturbance. Matrix and   biophysical larval flow models suggested one metapopulation. Southern,   Arabian, populations could be connected to northern, Iranian,   populations but this connectivity was lost under assumptions of pelagic   larval duration at rising temperatures shortened to a third. Then, the   metapopulation disintegrated into isolated populations. Connectivity   required to avoid extinctions increased exponentially with disturbance   frequency and correlation of disturbances across the metapopulation.   Populations became unsustainable at eight disturbances in 15 years, when   even highest theoretical recruitment no longer compensated mortality.   This lethal disturbance frequency was 3-fold that of the moderately   disturbed monitoring period and 4-fold of the preceding low-disturbance   period-suggesting ongoing shortening of the disturbance-free period.

Grouse bags were consistently   higher in regions of northern England than in Scotland and Wales, and   declined in all nine regions except southern Pennines from 1920 to 1950.   Bags in northern England increased significantly from 1950, coinciding   with increases in keeper density. In north-east Scotland and Wales,   numbers of grouse shot declined over the same period, coinciding with   declines in keeper density and increased afforestation of moors.

Fungi are the driving force   for ecosystem processes such as decomposition and carbon sequestration   in terrestrial habitats, and are strongly influenced by interactions   with invertebrates. Yet, interactions in detritivore communities have   rarely been considered from a network perspective. In the present study,   we analyse the interaction networks between three functional guilds of   fungi and insects sampled from dead wood. Using DNA metabarcoding to   identify fungi, we reveal a diversity of interactions differing in   specificity in the detritivore networks, involving three guilds of   fungi. Plant pathogenic fungi were relatively unspecialized in their   interactions with insects inhabiting dead wood, while interactions   between the insects and wood-decay fungi exhibited the highest degree of   specialization, which was similar to estimates for animal-mediated seed   dispersal networks in previous studies. The low degree of specialization   for insect symbiont fungi was unexpected. In general, the pooled   insect-fungus networks were significantly more specialized, more modular   and less nested than randomized networks.

In Japan, the multicolored Asian ladybird beetle, Harmonia   axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), an aphidophage, serves as   a natural pest control agent in agricultural production, although the   species' introduction into Europe and North America for pest control has   had a negative impact on native ecosystems. In the present study, 33   aphid-plant pairs from an agricultural landscape in the eastern Kanto   region of Japan were examined experimentally for initial larval   survivorship and development of H. axyridis. Significant differences   were found among plant-aphid pairs with regard to these parameters.

General theories of plant defence often fail to account for complex   interactions between the resources required for defence expression. For   example, the carbon that is used for carbon-based defence is acquired   using nutrient-rich photosynthetic pigments, while nutrient gain itself   requires substantial carbon allocation belowground. We should therefore   expect the expression of plant defence to reflect the tight linkage   between carbon and nutrient gain, yet mechanistic studies linking   resource gain with plant defence theory have been slow to emerge.   2. The overwhelming majority of plants participate in nutrition   mutualisms with fungal or bacterial symbionts. We propose the resource   exchange model of plant defence (REMPD) in which the costs and benefits   associated with nutrition mutualisms affect plant resource status and   allocation to growth and defence. The model predicts quadratic   relationships between mutualist abundance and expression of defence.   Within plant genotypes, both plant biomass and defence expression are   maximized at optimal nutrient exchange among mutualistic partners, and   as a consequence, the two are positively associated.   3. We tested the model by growing Asclepias syriaca, the common   milkweed, with two mycorrhizal fungal species in nine fungal abundance   treatments. Plant growth and defence traits and mycorrhizal colonization   were quantified after 14 weeks of plant growth. Linear, quadratic,   saturating and exponential decay models were fit to curves relating the   proportion of root colonized by mycorrhizal fungi to plant traits, and   compared using AICc.   4. As predicted by our model, increasing colonization by Scutellospora   pellucida produced quadratic responses in plant growth, latex exudation   and cardenolide production. In contrast, Glomus etunicatum appeared to   act as a parasite of A. syriaca, causing exponential decline in both   plant growth and latex exudation. As predicted by our model, plant   growth was positively correlated with all defences quantified.   5. Synthesis. The REMPD combines cost-benefit analysis of mutualisms   with plant resource acquisition strategies to predict the expression of   plant defence. The effects of S. pellucida and G. etunicatum on defence   expression differ; however, both provide support for the model and   suggest that resource mutualisms affect the expression of defence in a   predictable nonlinear fashion.",1181,Y,ER,no,no data on PP,

Here we present a quantitative analysis of the similarities and   differences of six different topological centrality measures as   indicators of keystone species in 17 food webs. These indicators account   for local, global and ``meso-scale'' - intermediate between local and   global - topological information about species in the food webs. Using   factor analysis we shown that most of these centrality indices share a   great deal of topological information, which range from 75\% to 96\%. A   generalized keystone indicator is then proposed by considering the   factor loadings of the six-centrality measures, which contains most of   the information encoded by these indices. However, the individual   ordering of species according to these criteria display significant   differences in most food webs. We simulate the effects of species   extinction by removing species ranked according to a local and a   ``meso-scale'' centrality indicator. The differences observed on three   network characteristics - size, average distance and clustering   coefficient of the largest component after the removal of the most   central nodes indicate that the consideration of these indices have   different impacts for the ranking of species with conservational biology   purposes.

We investigated the effects of mistletoe on leaf litter,   soil fertility and the understorey grass species composition and biomass   yield in semi-arid savanna, southwest Zimbabwe. Leaf litter was   significantly greater by up to 39 \% beneath infected trees than beneath   uninfected trees due to the additional mistletoe litter and the effect   of mistletoe on infected tree leaf litter. As a result, soil nutrient   concentrations under infected trees were higher by 34 \% for N, 36 \%   for Mg, 46 \% for P up to 72 \% for K than those below uninfected trees.   Associated with these changes in leaf litter and soil nutrient   concentrations was an increase in the species richness, density and   biomass yield of the understorey grass community. Changes in leaf litter   and soil fertility also led to altered root biomass allocation in   Andropogon gayanus. Therefore, by increasing leaf litter and soil   fertility under canopies of infected trees, mistletoe positively   influences the composition, productivity and biomass allocation of   understorey grasses.

Yet, these estimates did not explicitly incorporate the cascade of   complex feedbacks associated with virus-mediated lysis. To evaluate the   role of viruses in shaping community structure and ecosystem   functioning, we extend dynamic multitrophic ecosystem models to include   a virus component, specifically parameterized for processes taking place   in the ocean euphotic zone. Crucially, we are able to solve this model   analytically, facilitating evaluation of model behavior under many   alternative parameterizations. Analyses reveal that the addition of a   virus component promotes the emergence of complex communities. In   addition, biomass partitioning of the emergent multitrophic community is   consistent with well-established empirical norms in the surface oceans.   At steady state, ecosystem fluxes can be probed to characterize the   effects that viruses have when compared with putative marine surface   ecosystems without viruses. The model suggests that ecosystems with   viruses will have (1) increased organic matter recycling, (2) reduced   transfer to higher trophic levels and (3) increased net primary   productivity. These model findings support hypotheses that viruses can   have significant stimulatory effects across whole-ecosystem scales. We   suggest that existing efforts to predict carbon and nutrient cycling   without considering virus effects are likely to miss essential features   of marine food webs that regulate global biogeochemical cycles.",1185,Y,ER,no,no data on PP,model

Important components of the resistome are intrinsic resistance   genes of environmental bacteria, evolved and acquired over millennia,   and their mobilization, which drives dissemination in pathogens.   Understanding the dynamics and evolution of resistance across bacterial   taxa is essential to address the current crisis in drug-resistant   infections. Here we report the exploration of antibiotic resistance in   the Paenibacillaceae prompted by our discovery of an ancient intrinsic   resistome in Paenibacillus sp.

Using biochemical and gene expression   analysis, we have mined the resistome of the second member of the   Paenibacillaceae family, Brevibacillus brevis VM4, which produces   several antimicrobial secondary metabolites. Using phylogenomics, we   show that Paenibacillaceae resistomes are in flux, evolve mostly   independent of secondary metabolite biosynthetic diversity, and are   characterized by cryptic, redundant, pseudoparalogous, and orthologous   genes. We find that in contrast to pathogens, mobile genetic elements   are not significantly responsible for resistome remodeling.

However, the advantage gained through enemy release may   diminish over time as pathogens, parasites, or herbivores accumulate on   invasive species. Pathogen accumulation may result from the development   of novel host-pathogen interactions in the invasive range or the   introduction of pathogens from the invader's home range or other areas.   Previous studies suggest that pathogen accumulation may reduce the   performance of invasive species but experimental demonstrations are   lacking. Microstegium vimineum is a highly invasive annual grass with an   expanding distribution in eastern North America. Bipolaris species and   other fungal pathogens have recently been shown to cause foliar blight   on invasive populations of Microstegium. Here we used experimental   inoculations in controlled laboratory and greenhouse conditions and   fungicide applications in the field to evaluate host relations of   pathogens infecting invasive Microstegium and the ecological   consequences of pathogen infection in nature. Four of seven native plant   species tested, including three native grasses and one forb, became   infected by at least one of the five pathogens isolated from   Microstegium, suggesting that the native species might be sources or   alternative hosts for Microstegium pathogens. Microstegium populations   may also provide a reservoir of pathogens that could spillover to   co-occurring native species and exacerbate the effects of invasions. All   five pathogens caused foliar lesions on Microstegium, but there was over   a four-fold difference in lesion area caused by different pathogens.   Fungicide applications to infected field populations significantly   reduced disease symptoms, increased invader biomass by up to 50\% and   increased seed head production by up to 200\% compared to controls. Our   results show that pathogen infection of invasive Microstegium caused   significant declines in invasive host performance in natural   populations, suggesting that the release of invasive species from   natural enemies may be temporary.",1187,N,ER,,,

DGGE   analysis and 18S rRNA gene clone libraries showed that this mesopelagic   protist community was dynamic, with marked changes in taxonomic and   functional community composition in different seasons, The most   frequently recovered sequences in autumn were related to heterotrophic   dinoflagellates. In late December 2003, an abrupt change in the   community composition occurred following an influx of water from the   lower Pacific halocline that flowed onto the Arctic continental shelf   and into Franklin Bay. Subsequently, the most frequently retrieved   sequences matched uncultured marine alveolates, which are thought to be   primarily parasites. This community changed little over the winter, with   modest changes in spring marked by the addition of taxa. Summer   libraries from 2004 were once more dominated by dinoflagellate sequences   with a community very similar to that at the end of autumn 2003. These   summer and autumn communities corresponded to periods of higher   phytoplankton sedimentation rates in the euphotic zone.

Laboratory studies   have demonstrated that guppies can consume large numbers of larval   mosquitoes. Our study investigates how intraspecific variability in   guppy phenotype affects their importance as a mosquito biocontrol and   how habitat conditions (natural ponds vs. water storage containers) may   influence insect biomass and guppy feeding. Using a blocked experimental   design, we established stream-side mesocosm ponds with half receiving   gravel substrate to simulate pond-bottom habitat. To provide realistic   diet choices and insect abundances, we allowed the mesocosms to colonize   naturally with aquatic insect larvae for 1 month before introducing   guppies. We tested two distinct guppy phenotypes (from high- and   low-predation streams) alongside fish-free controls. After 1 month, we   measured insect biomass in the mesocosms and examined guppy gut contents   to document direct predation. While overall insect biomass was not   significantly different across the three fish treatments, we observed a   significant reduction in mosquito biomass in fish treatments compared to   fish-free controls, as well as intraspecific differences in feeding.   Overall insect biomass was significantly higher in mesocosms without   gravel, while habitat condition had no effect on mosquito biomass. As   guppy phenotype responds to changes in their environments, it is an   important consideration for biocontrol policy to anticipate potential   ecosystem effects. We close by relating our findings to other studies   and by discussing the implications and potential risks of using guppies   to control mosquitoes.",1190,N,ER,,,

The understanding of the consequences of zinc application   requires insight into ecological aspects of changes in soil microbial   communities. Here, we evaluated the effects of zinc application on   richness, diversity, evenness and structure of microbial functional   genes in sugarcane-cultivated soil, and response thresholds of abundance   for groups of microbial functional genes on different zinc   concentrations added to the soil (0, 5,10 and 20 kg Zn ha(-1)) in two   sugarcane fields in the Northeastern sac.

Using a   high density functional gene array termed GeoChip 5.0, which contains   101,796 distinct probes belonging to gene categories involved in zinc   transport, secondary metabolism, stress, virulence and nutrient cycling,   differences were observed in the functional gene structure of microbial   communities and abundance of specific gene families with a threshold   between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha(-1). However, the richness, diversity and   evenness of functional genes did not differ across the zinc gradients in   soil. Cluster analysis based on microbial functional subcategories   revealed variation in abundances across the gradient of zinc   concentrations in soil mainly for virulence, stress, secondary   metabolism, and carbon- and phosphorus-cycling-related gene families. A   threshold in abundance was observed between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha(-1) with   high abundance of microbial gene families associated with zinc   transporter proteins, antioxidant enzymes, exoenzymes associated with   infection, secretion proteins, virulence regulatory genes, carbon   fixation, and phosphorus utilization in soils supplemented with up to 5   kg Zn ha(-1). In these same soils, reduced abundance was observed for   gene families associated with methanogenesis, metabolism of halogen and   carotenoid, and antiphagocytosis compared with soil supplements with 10   or 20 kg Zn ha(-1).

Under climate change, those effects could signal   potential vegetation shifts occurring over large geographical areas,   with major impacts on ecosystem form and function. In this article, we   studied the effect of a single drought episode, occurred which in summer   2005, on a Scots pine population in central Pyrenees (NE Spain). Our   main objective was to study the environmental correlates of forest   decline and vegetation change at the plot level. General and generalized   linear models were used to study the relationship between canopy   defoliation, mortality and recruitment, and plot characteristics. A   drought-driven multifactor dieback was observed in the study forest.   Defoliation and mortality were associated with the local level of   drought stress estimated at each plot. In addition, stand structure,   soil properties, and mistletoe infection were also associated with the   observed pattern of defoliation, presumably acting as long-term   predisposing factors. Recruitment of Scots pine was low in all plots. In   contrast, we observed abundant recruitment of other tree species, mostly   Quercus ilex and Q. humilis, particularly in plots where Scots pine   showed high defoliation and mortality. These results suggest that an   altitudinal upwards migration of Quercus species, mediated by the   dieback of the currently dominant species, may take place in the studied   slopes. Many rear-edge populations of Scots pine sheltered in the   mountain environments of the Iberian Peninsula could be at risk under   future climate scenarios.",1192,N,ER,,,

Accurate   assessment of nematode assemblages requires insight into the   distribution of specimens with distinct food preferences.

Here, we quantified the transmission success of the   trematode Maritrema novaezealandense to its intertidal amphipod   intermediate host Paracalliope novizealandiae, as well as the host's   survival, under acidified conditions. We used a custom-built system to   simulate ocean acidification with 3 different seawater treatments: 8.1   pH, corresponding to current average ocean surface waters, as well as   7.6 and 7.4 pH, the levels predicted for the years 2100 and 2300,   respectively. In 2 separate experiments, parasite transmission success   tended to peak in the most acidified conditions (7.4 pH), although this   was only statistically significant when a wide range of infection doses   was used. Because the survival of the parasite's transmission stages   decreases with decreasing pH, this pattern suggests that host   susceptibility remains unaffected at 7.6 pH and is only compromised with   further acidification. Amphipod mortality was not affected by pH levels,   though it tended to be lowest at 7.6 pH, where the longevity of parasite   transmission stages was reduced but host susceptibility was unaffected.

In this study we examined whether managements practices as insecticide   application and different tillage regimes, can influence biological   control of a herbivorous pest on oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). The   endoparasitoids Phradis interstitialis Thomson and Tersilochus   heterocerus Thomson were studied as they are important for the   biological control of the pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.) which is   a common pest on oilseed rape in Europe.

The number of emerging P. interstitialis and T. heterocerus were   significantly reduced in insecticide treated fields, but the tillage   regimes had no effect on the number of emerging females of either   parasitoid species.

This is the first disease-related die-off of a diadematid documented in   the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Diseased individuals showed deterioration of   the epidermis and water-vascular system, resulting in epidermal necrosis   and release of spines. Despite some spatial heterogeneity in disease   incidence at the study sites, there was a 65\% overall reduction in   urchin abundance after the mortality event compared to numbers   pre-mortality.

Bacterial isolation and culture techniques, and subsequent   laboratory infection experiments, strongly suggested that Vibrio   alginolyticus was involved in the disease.

We use this approach along a chronosequence of disease   infestation (Phytophthora cinnamomi) in the species-diverse Banksia   woodlands of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). We   compare the use of absolute (community-weighted totals-CWT) and relative   cover data (community-weighted means-CWM) to demonstrate the importance   of total cover change in reference to the Mass Ratio Hypothesis.   Plant species cover-abundance was recorded along a space-for-time   disease chronosequence, and functional trait data collected for the 48   dominant species from healthy vegetation. Six traits with deduced links   to key ecosystem functions were measured for each species and values for   two indices (CWT and CWM) compared along the disease chronosequence.   Trait data was collected on plant height, growth form, specific leaf   area, leaf dry matter content, root pattern and carbohydrate storage.   Despite substantial shifts in individual species cover and a reduction   in total species cover, the majority of CWM values did not change   significantly following disease infestation. The use of relative   cover-abundance data disregards important changes in total species   cover, apparent from our comparative analysis. In contrast to CWMs, all   CWT values were reduced following disease infestation, suggesting a   potential reduction in productivity, reduced capacity as a carbon sink   and altered site water balance. Verification of these potential changes   in ecosystem functions is required using fine-scale quantitative   techniques. The CWT index is complementary to traditional CWMs and   useful when analysing changes in plant trait data where total species   cover changes have been detected. In relation to P. cinnamomi   infestation, shifts in CWT trait values indicate the ability of an   introduced plant pathogen to have substantial indirect impacts beyond   substantial floristic change.

These   impacts have ramifications for animals that share resources and across   trophic levels. High deer densities result from an absence of predators   or high plant productivity, often due to human habitat modifications,   and from the desires of stakeholders that set deer management goals   based on cultural, rather than biological, carrying capacity. Success at   maintaining forest ecosystems require regulating deer below biological   carrying capacity, as measured by ecological impacts. Control methods   limit reproduction through modifications in habitat productivity or   increase mortality through increasing predators or hunting. Hunting is   the primary deer management tool and relies on active participation of   citizens. Hunters are capable of reducing deer densities but struggle   with creating densities sufficiently low to ensure the persistence of   rare species. Alternative management models may be necessary to achieve   densities sufficiently below biological carrying capacity. Regardless of   the population control adopted, success should be measured by ecological   benchmarks and not solely by cultural acceptance.",1204,N,ER,,,

Moreover, dung-dependent   livestock parasites can be reduced by combusting fecal pats in   prescribed burns. We conducted a study to identify factors that   influence combustion of cattle fecal pats. Fifty fecal pats were located   in each burn unit before 10 prescribed fires and then rated for   combustion after each fire. Combustion of cattle fecal pats was highly   variable across fires, with average proportion of combustion of   individual pats from the 10 fires ranging from 2 +/- 2 to 98 +/- 1\%   (mean +/- SE). Of 10 fecal pat, fuel, and weather variables assessed,   only fecal pat condition, 10-h time-lag dead fuel moisture (DFM), and   fuel load entered as variables in a stepwise selection method of   constructing a multiple regression model of combustion of fecal pats   (R-2=0.94, P < 0.01). Condition of fecal pats (a function of elapsed   time since deposition, fuel moisture, and decomposition) explained the   greatest variation of pat combustion (partial R-2=0.75), followed by   10-h DFM (partial R-2=0.12) and fuel load (partial R-2=0.07). Combustion   was <10\% when 10-h DFM exceeded 13\% regardless of pat condition. For   every 1 Mg . ha(-1) increase in fuel load, combustion of older and drier   fecal pats increased by about 7\%, but combustion of fresh fecal pats   always averaged <20\% and was unrelated to fuel load.

The objectives of this study were to examine how   three factors-seed disperser behavior, post-dispersal host compatibility   and canopy cover-affect the spatial distribution of a generalist   mistletoe Dendrophthoe pentandra (Loranthaceae) in plantation and   rainforest within Xishuangbanna, Southwest China.   Methods   We observed mistletoe D. pentandra infection patterns at the scale of   individual trees and sixteen 400-m(2) forest plots in adjacent   plantation and rainforest within Xishuangbanna. To elucidate what   determines infection patterns at different scales and in different   forest types, we observed the behavior of major avian seed dispersers   and carried out a seed inoculation experiment to examine how   post-dispersal compatibility and light incidence affect the infection of   different hosts.   Important Findings   Dendrophthoe pentandra displayed an aggregated distribution and infected   10 species in our study site, with a significantly higher infection   prevalence and intensity in the plantation than in the tropical forest.   Different seed dispersers provided contrasting initial mistletoe   templates: the specialist frugivore Dicaeum concolor (plain   flowerpecker) preferred to fly between mistletoes in infected trees in   the plantation and likely intensified existing infections. In contrast,   the dietary generalist Pycnonotus jocosus (red-whiskered bulbul) was   more likely to visit uninfected trees, thereby establishing new   infections. Thus, seed dispersal appears to be an important determinant   of the mistletoes distribution, with deposition patterns providing an   initial distribution template and determining small-scale patterns.   However, post-dispersal and abiotic factors revealed that different host   compatibilities and levels of light incidence in different habitats   affected the survival of D. pentandra seedlings. Hence, our findings   suggest that seed dispersal interacts with host compatibility and canopy   cover to determine establishment success, survival and the observed   distribution patterns.",1206,N,ER,,,

However, the environmental factors determining   their activity and community structure in different soils are still not   fully understood. Here, a bioassay is presented to assess the   infectivity of indigenous mycorrhizal communities in twenty soils   sampled in the Swiss agricultural belt north of the Alps. This bioassay   indicated clear negative relationships between the mycorrhizal   colonization of bioassay plant roots and the phosphorus and nitrogen   concentrations in plant biomass. Further, comparison of the bioassay   results with a range of physicochemical, biological, and geographic   parameters of the soils confirmed a negative relationship between the   soil phosphorus status and the mycorrhizal colonization of the plants.   Other parameters, such as land use, base saturation, pH, and soil   texture, had little explanatory value for patterns in the growth,   nutrition, and mycorrhizal colonization of the bioassay plants.

Importantly, it is now well established that plant species   dynamic is tightly interlinked with the development of soil community.   The rhizosphere, i.e. the biologically active soil compartment where   root-root and root-microbes communications occurred, is of particular   importance in mediating plant fitness and community composition. This   active soil zone promotes inter alia the proliferation of particular   microbial communities strongly involved in plant nutrition capabilities.

In this study, we document   widespread mortality of another dominant North American hardwood   species, redbay (Persea borbonia, Lauraceae), from an exotic disease,   laurel wilt. This disease is caused by a nonnative Asian ambrosia   beetle, Xyleborus glabratus, and its pathogenic fungal symbiont,   Raffaelea lauricola, which were introduced to Georgia, USA in 2003. We   conducted tree surveys on an island near the center of introduction from   2004 to 2009 and assessed the trajectory of tree mortality caused by   laurel wilt. Additionally, we examined sprouting as a mechanism for   persistence and whether changes in community structure occurred after   laurel wilt introduction. We observed 98 \% death of main stems and   widespread mortality of genets (79 \%) independent of main stem size.   All remaining individuals were symptomatic of laurel wilt. Sprouting   does not appear to give redbay the ability to maintain genets and   recruit new stems into the forest canopy. We identified a negative   interaction between laurel wilt and deer browse on stems and new   sprouts, which may accelerate death rates of infected populations.

Lately, however, positive effects were shown to be transient and highly   trait-specific within the social bumblebees. Contrary to bumblebees,   solitary wild bees may benefit more sustainably from mass-flowering   crops due to a better seasonal match of the mass provision of resources   and their sexual reproduction. We quantified reproductive activity and   reproductive output of the polylectic solitary bee Osmia rufa during and   after mass-flowering in landscapes with differing amounts of oilseed   rape and semi-natural habitats. Across seasons, the number of produced   offspring increased with availability of oilseed rape and semi-natural   habitats while brood abortion decreased with the former and parasitation   with the latter. Season-specific analyses suggest that increased   nest-building during mass-flowering of oilseed rape early in the season   outweighs negative effects on the number of cells per nest and the   percentage of parasitized cells once the mass-flowering has ceased. No   effect on number of cells per nest during mass-flowering and exemplary   pollen analysis indicate that oilseed rape benefits solitary bees in the   form of abundant nectar for foraging flights rather than pollen for   brood provisioning. Besides providing permanent forage and nesting   sites, semi-natural elements seem to benefit pollinators also by   mitigating negative effects of parasitation, potentially via enhanced   hyperparasitism. In conclusion, O. rufa clearly benefits from   mass-flowering oilseed rape. Yet, the outweighing of the negative   post-flowering effects by the early benefits of oilseed rape is tightly   linked to the bee's polylecty and early phenology. Thus, it remains to   be tested if species unable to utilize oilseed rape due to mismatched   oligolecty or later phenology suffer disproportionally from the   post-flowering phase of oilseed rape.",1213,N,ER,,,

We demonstrate that the same   epidemiological mechanisms drive disease intensity and coarse woody   debris (CWD) dynamics in natural forest ecosystems impacted by an   emerging disease. Sudden oak death (causal agent, Phytophthora ramorum)   has caused mortality of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) on a   spatial scale and rate comparable to other major North American forest   diseases caused by invasive pathogens. In pathogen invaded stands, mean   CWD masses were 22.4 Mg ha(-1) of standing dead tanoak (snags) and 11.5   Mg ha(-1) in logs compared to 0.27 and 1.16 Mg ha(-1) of snags and logs   in an uninvaded stand. Within invaded stands variation in CWD mass and   accumulation rates were largely driven by the distribution of   pre-disease tanoak biomass and the densities of infected tanoak and   California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) which jointly determine   P. ramorum sporulation and disease emergence rates. In a narrow range of   community and host characteristics sudden oak death can result in woody   debris dynamics similar to discrete disturbances such as fire and forest   harvest but it is more common to have lower maximum amounts with slower   rates of accumulation than these better studied disturbances.

Methods   A 5-year time-series of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer   (MODIS) satellite imagery and corresponding field data was utilized to   compare various vegetation indices that measure productivity with the   goal of indirectly estimating mouse abundance and SNV prevalence.   Relationships between the vegetation indices and deer mouse density, SNV   prevalence and the number of infected deer mice at various time lags   were examined to assess which indices and associated time lags might be   valuable in predicting SNV outbreaks.   Results   The results reveal varying levels of positive correlation between the   vegetation indices and deer mouse density as well as the number of   infected deer mice.

We fertilized two microhabitats in a California salt   marsh that were dominated by Salicornia virginica or a mixture of S.   virginica and Jaumea carnosa.

When host   nitrogen content was altered by fertilizing plots, however, the percent   cover of the parasite doubled. Although parasitic plants and their hosts   have similar tissue nitrogen contents, suggesting no stoichiometric   imbalance between host and consumer, parasitic plants do not feed on   host tissue, but on host xylem and phloem, which are very low in   nitrogen.

Studies of these interactions in insects have mostly focussed on the   direct effects of symbiont infection on natural enemies without studying   community-wide effects. Here, we explore the effect of a defensive   symbiont on population dynamics and species extinctions in an   experimental community composed of three aphid species and their   associated specialist parasitoids. We found that introducing a bacterial   symbiont with a protective (but not a non-protective) phenotype into one   aphid species led to it being able to escape from its natural enemy and   increase in density. This changed the relative density of the three   aphid species which resulted in the extinction of the two other   parasitoid species. Our results show that defensive symbionts can cause   extinction cascades in experimental communities and so may play a   significant role in the stability of consumer-herbivore communities in   the field.",1220,N,ER,,,

Phenolic compounds of brown   seaweeds are secondary metabolites involved in many different protection   mechanisms, as for example against grazer and pathogen attack as well as   UV damage. This study was thus aimed at understanding the influence of   both day/night and tidal cycles on the brown seaweed phenol pool with   respect to their bathymetric level on the shore. These cycles affect the   quantity and quality of light received by intertidal seaweeds   (protection via the water layer during immersion), and the   photoprotective role of phlorotannins was thus evaluated. Phenol levels   and antioxidant capacities were monitored every hour during a tidal   cycle and a half at the equinox spring tide, in March 2003. The three   species contained rather high phenol levels, i.e. about 3, 6 and 4\% DW   in R canaliculata, A. nodosum and B. bifurcata, respectively.   Antioxidant capacities globally paralleled phenol contents in the three   species under study. Moreover, the measured antioxidant capacities and   the phenol contents of the extracts were significantly and positively   correlated in the three species. Significant effect of neither cycles   nor their interaction was observed in any species despite a trend to   follow day/night alternation for R canaliculata, and emersion/immersion   cycle for A. nodosum. No trend was observed for the third species.   However, significant correlations between phenol levels of R   canaliculata and A. nodosum and measured air-temperature were found. Our   results suggested an effect of aerial, aquatic and both conditions on   the phenolic pool of P canaliculata, B. bifurcata and A. nodosum,   respectively, and a fast evolution of the phenolic pool on a day time   scale.

Diversity of kingdoms, species and genepools   can increase the productivity of farming systems in a range of growing   conditions, and more diverse farming systems are also generally more   resilient in the face of perturbations, thus enhancing food security.   Diversity can maintain and increase soil fertility and mitigate the   impact of pests and diseases. Diversity of diet, founded on diverse   farming systems, delivers better nutrition and greater health, with   additional benefits for human productivity and livelihoods. Agricultural   biodiversity will also be absolutely essential to cope with the   predicted impacts of climate change, not simply as a source of traits   but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems.

Thus, with climate   warming, an alteration of the response to seasonal changes is expected,   either through genetic adaptations to novel climatic conditions or   phenotypic plasticity. Since the 1980s in western France, the winter   guild of aphid parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in cereal fields   has been made up of two species: Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Aphidius   matricariae. The recent activity of two other species, Aphidius avenae   and Aphidius ervi, during the winter months suggests that a modification   of aphid parasitoid overwintering strategies has taken place within the   guild. In this study, we first performed a field survey in the winter of   2014/15 to assess levels of parasitoid diapause incidence in   agrosystems. Then, we compared the capacity of the four parasitoid   species to enter winter diapause under nine different photoperiods and   temperature conditions in the laboratory. As predicted, historically   winter-active species (A. rhopalosiphi and A. matricariae) never entered   diapause, whereas the species more recently active during winter (A.   avenae and A. ervi) did enter diapause but at a low proportion (maximum   of 13.4 and 11.2\%, respectively). These results suggest rapid shifts   over the last three decades in the overwintering strategies of aphid   parasitoids in Western France, probably due to climate warming. This   implies that diapause can be replaced by active adult overwintering,   with potential consequences for species interactions, insect community   composition, ecosystem functioning, and natural pest control.",1226,N,ER,,,

However, this is   not straightforward or well-studied among large mammals with group sizes   that range several orders of magnitude or aggregation patterns that vary   across space and time. To address this issue, we examined spatial   variation in elk (Cerous canadensis) aggregation patterns and   brucellosis across 10 regions in the Greater Yellowstone Area where   previous studies suggest the disease may be increasing. We hypothesized   that rates of increasing brucellosis would be better related to the   frequency of large groups than mean group size or population density,   but we examined whether other measures of density would also explain   rising seroprevalence. To do this, we measured wintering elk density and   group size across multiple spatial and temporal scales from monthly   aerial surveys. We used Bayesian hierarchical models and 20 years of   serologic data to estimate rates of increase in brucellosis within the   10 regions, and to examine the linear relationships between these   estimated rates of increase and multiple measures of aggregation.   Brucellosis seroprevalence increased over time in eight regions (one   region showed an estimated increase from 0.015 in 1991 to 0.26 in 2011),   and these rates of increase were positively related to all measures of   aggregation. The relationships were weaker when the analysis was   restricted to areas where brucellosis was present for at least two   years, potentially because aggregation was related to   disease-establishment within a population. Our findings suggest that (1)   group size did not explain brucellosis increases any better than   population density and (2) some elk populations may have high densities   with small groups or lower densities with large groups, but brucellosis   is likely to increase in either scenario. In this case, any one control   method such as reducing population density or group size may not be   sufficient to reduce transmission.

In the latter, incubation, heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF)   abundance increased approximately 15-fold during the study. A multiple   regression analysis using microbial abundances and grazing rates as   parameters indicated that 78\% of the variability in the abundance of   giant VLPs was explained by HNF abundance and grazing rates. Our data   support the hypothesis that this virus population infects flagellates.   Observation of a presumptive lysing flagellate cell suggests a viral   burst size of 15. Estimations of decay and net production rates from   dialysis bag incubations indicate that lysis due to giant viruses could   cause between 10 to 60\% of the mortality of the total flagellate   community and, thus, viruses are potentially a significant factor   shaping the population dynamics of flagellates in freshwater.",1229,N,ER,,,

N and P release   rates were increased by infection when Daphnia were fed P-poor diets,   but we found no effect of infection on the nutrient release of   individuals fed P-rich diets. Calculations based on the first law of   thermodynamics indicated that infection should increase the nutrient   release rates of Daphnia by decreasing nutrient accumulation rates in   host tissues. Although we found reduced nutrient accumulation rates in   infected Daphnia fed all diets, this reduction did not increase the   nutrient release rates of Daphnia fed the P-rich diet because infected   Daphnia fed this diet ingested nutrients more slowly than uninfected   hosts.

There was   no pCO(2) effect on gross production in C. elongata and L. incrustans   but L. incrustans respiration strongly increased with elevated pCO(2). L   corallioides gross production slightly increased at 1000 mu atm, while   respiration remained unaffected. Calcification rates decreased with   pCO(2) in L. incrustans (both in the light and dark) and L. corallioides   (only in the light), while C. elongata calcification was unaffected.   This was consistent with the lower skeletal mMg/Ca ratio of C. elongata   (0.17) relative to the two other species (0.20). L. incrustans had a   higher occurrence of bleaching that increased with increasing pCO(2).   pCO(2) could indirectly impact this coralline species physiology making   them more sensitive to other stresses such as diseases or pathogens.

About 40\% only flower up to 2 years   after fire (obligate), while the rest continue at a low rate until the   next fire (facultative). Peak flowering occurs 5-18 months after fire in   the mediterranean regions but at 1-7 months in savannas. Fsf is recorded   in 34 families, headed by terrestrial orchids (45\% of species), spread   throughout the seed-plant phylogeny from cycads to daisies. Tuberous   geophytes (essentially orchids) dominate (51\%), but other resprouting   growth forms include lignotuberous shrubs and forbs, rhizomatous and   bunch grasses, leaf succulents, grasstrees, epicormic trees, and   hemiparasites. Most have wind-dispersed diaspores (72\%), store their   diaspores in the soil (93\%), and seeds that do not germinate until the   next fire (72\%). Fsf in association with resprouting takes advantage of   optimal resources and minimal competition for growth and reproduction,   conditions that favor wind dispersal and maximize the interval for seed   accumulation before the next fire and build-up of fire-tolerant organs.   Reduced herbivory has little role in accounting for its benefits. The   proximal causes of fsf center around cueing factors (direct effects such   as ethylene), resource factors (direct and indirect effects, e.g., extra   nutrients), and predisposing factors (circumstantial effects, e.g., fire   interval). The evolutionary history of fsf has been explored recently in   orchids, proteas, blood roots, droseras, and mistletoes and shown to   stretch back over a period of at least 50 million years, indicating that   flowering in many groups has a long association with fire as an agent of   natural selection.",1235,N,ER,,,

The role of soil fauna is poorly   explored in ecotones, although their positive and negative effects on   plant species can influence plant community structure. We studied   nematode communities in response to experimental warming (ambient, +1.7,   +3.4 A degrees C) in soils of closed and open canopy forest in the   temperate-boreal ecotone of Minnesota, USA and calculated various   established nematode indices. We estimated species-specific coverage of   understory herbaceous and shrub plant species from the same experimental   plots and tested if changes in the nematode community are associated   with plant cover and composition. Individual nematode trophic groups did   not differ among warming treatments, but the ratio between   microbial-feeding and plant-feeding nematodes increased significantly   and consistently with warming in both closed and open canopy areas and   at both experimental field sites. The increase in this ratio was   positively correlated with total cover of understory plant species,   perhaps due to increased predation pressure on soil microorganisms   causing higher nutrient availability for plants. Multivariate analyses   revealed that temperature treatment, canopy conditions and nematode   density consistently shaped understory plant communities across   experimental sites.

In addition, we   investigated bidirectional, multipartite interactions between this   seaweed host, its pathogens, and consumers. Although we found no   negative impacts of disease on survival of D. pulchra, bleaching had   substantial, negative consequences for affected individuals, including a   dramatic drop in fecundity and a significant decrease in size. In the   first direct demonstration of bacterial disease-mediated herbivory of   seaweeds, herbivores generally preferred to consume bleached tissue in   feeding trials, and we also found higher densities of herbivores on   bleached than co-occurring, healthy algae at sites where herbivores were   abundant. In a conceptually reciprocal test of the effects of herbivores   on infection, we showed that simulated herbivory increased   susceptibility to bleaching when algae were also exposed to cultures of   a bacterial pathogen. Given the high proportions of D. pulchra affected   by bleaching during peak periods, the impacts of this disease are likely   to have important implications at the population level. This work   highlights complex interactions between habitat-forming organisms and   their natural enemies and further emphasizes the need to consider   disease in ecological research.",1237,Y,ER,yes,,

Simms",2011,"Negotiation, Sanctions, and Context Dependency in the Legume-Rhizobium   Mutualism",AMERICAN NATURALIST,1-14,1-14,10.1086/659997,"Two important questions about mutualisms are how the fitness costs and   benefits to the mutualist partners are determined and how these   mechanisms affect the evolutionary dynamics of the mutualism. We tackle   these questions with a model of the legume-rhizobium symbiosis that   regards the mutualism outcome as a result of biochemical negotiations   between the plant and its nodules. We explore the fitness consequences   of this mechanism to the plant and rhizobia and obtain four main   results. First, negotiations permit the plant to differentially reward   more-cooperative rhizobia-a phenomenon termed ``plant sanctions''-but   only when more-cooperative rhizobia also provide the plant with good   outside options during negotiations with other nodules. Second,   negotiations may result in seemingly paradoxical cases where the plant   is worse off when it has a ``choice'' between two strains of rhizobia   than when infected by either strain alone. Third, even when sanctions   are effective, they are by themselves not sufficient to maintain   cooperative rhizobia in a population: less cooperative strains always   have an advantage at the population level. Finally, partner fidelity   feedback, together with genetic correlations between a rhizobium   strain's cooperativeness and the outside options it provides, can   maintain cooperative rhizobia. Our results show how joint control over   the outcome of a mutualism through the proximate mechanism of   negotiation can affect the evolutionary dynamics of interspecific   cooperation.",1238,N,ER,,,

These organisms can be affected directly by the transgene   products, or indirectly by pleiotropic effects, which may influence the   composition of plant compounds, such as the lignin content or the C/N   ratio that could even modify matter flux. Therefore, an ecological risk   assessment for GM plants also has to include decomposers. In a   laboratory diet experiment, we investigated possible effects of   transgenic antifungal wheat on two saprophagous Diptera species, the   drosophilid Drosophila melanogaster and the phorid Megaselia scalaris.   We used several experimental transgenic wheat varieties with a specific   antifungal powdery mildew resistance (Pm3b) and varieties with a broad   antifungal resistance, which is based on the expression of chitinase and   glucanase. We determined if important fitness parameters, such as   fertility, development time and sex ratio differed when the two   saprophagous Diptera species were fed with either leaves of transgenic   or non-transgenic wheat. To include potential long-term effects, we   performed our experiments over four fly generations. Additionally, we   analysed the C/N ratio, and the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin   contents of the different wheat lines to investigate any changes in the   diet composition, which may alter food quality through potential   pleiotropic effects. We found occasional differences in development time   or the number of offspring for both dipteran species in several   investigated diet comparisons but we found no consistent pattern of GM   wheat effects on the tested dipteran species. Though some wheat lines   showed an altered chemical composition, possibly indicating a   pleiotropic effect, we found no correlation between diet quality of the   wheat lines and fitness parameters. Our study shows also that dipterans   represent useful model species with M. scalaris being the most suitable   species, and that our experimental approach is an appropriate laboratory   method to investigate the decomposition of GM material by insect larvae.

We determined the degree of host specificity in the mistletoe   Viscum rotundifolium at Pniel Estates, near Kimberley, South Africa. We   found that V rotundifolium parasitises only Ehretia rigida and Ziziphus   mucronata at this site. Both commonly parasitised host species were not   the most abundant trees, were not the tallest trees, and did not have   the highest water or nutrient content of trees in the area, although   these factors are good predictors for mistletoe parasitism. Mistletoe   seeds deposited on branches of E. rigida and Z. mucronata have a greater   chance of attachment and subsequent survival, compared with those seeds   deposited on co-occurring Acacia and other potential host species. The   mistletoes had higher water potential than their host trees and by doing   so they can passively maintain the flow of nutrients. In addition, the   mistletoes had a N:Ca ratio >1, indicating active uptake from host   phloem. Thus, this mistletoe species uses both passive and active   uptake, which may be a selective advantage in a nutrient-poor   environment or on a nutrient-deficient host species.

Preferences for certain plant species are related to   nutritional restrictions and behavioural patterns, which could be   altered in the presence of an infectious disease. Several native small   mammals are part of the wild cycle of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi,   responsible for Chagas disease in humans. This is a vector-borne disease   transmitted by insects of the subfamily Triatominae. We examined the   effect of T.cruzi infection status on the use and preference patterns of   shrub species by two native rodent species: Octodon degus and Phyllotis   darwini. This study was conducted during four sampling years (2010-2013)   in a hyper-endemic zone of Chagas disease located in a semiarid   Mediterranean ecosystem. We captured individuals of 599 O.degus and 575   P.darwini (89\% of the total captures), which were related to nine shrub   species and examined for T.cruzi infection. In a community-level   analysis, infected and non-infected O.degus used individual shrub   species within the shrub community significantly non-randomly relative   to their availability; the same pattern was detected for non-infected   P.darwini individuals, whereas infected individuals used the shrub   community according to the abundance of each shrub species. Examining   individual preferences, both rodents showed a strong preference for   Flourensia thurifera and Colliguaja odorifera regardless of their   infection status. Preferences for specific shrub species were variable   among years, showing a core' of preferred shrub species and variable   levels of use of the remaining ones.

Organisms atop trophic chains are particularly   sensitive to disturbance, especially when they are dependent on a   specific trophic resource subject to strong fluctuations in density and   quality, which is the case of parasitoids. We investigated the (1)   variability in spatiotemporal relative abundance patterns of a cereal   aphid parasitoid community, determining at what scales such patterns   vary in agrosystems. We also investigated whether (2) parasitoid   relative abundances are strongly influenced by host relative abundances   and if (3) different host species are exploited at distinct rates. Aphid   parasitoid populations were monitored in three remote agricultural   regions in France between 2010 and 2012. Five parasitoid species   (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) and three aphid species   (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were identified in each of those three regions.   Fields sampled in one region in a single year exhibited similar relative   abundance patterns, with aphid parasitoid communities varying across   regions and years. All parasitoid species were able to exploit each   monitored host species. Metopolophium dirhodum Wlk was consistently a   more frequent species among parasitized aphids than among living aphids,   indicating that this aphid species was exploited at a higher rate than   the other two aphid species found (Sitobion avenae F and Rhopalosiphum   padi L). Those findings suggest the cereal aphid-parasitoid network is   not strictly determined by the intrinsic permanent environmental   characteristics but partially varies from one year to another. The   similarity in abundance patterns in different fields of a region in a   given year suggests the existence of a mechanism allowing a rapid   synchronisation of the relative abundance patterns at an intra-regional   scale. This phenomenon could be useful in predicting host-parasitoid   communities and bear important consequences for the ecosystem service   provided by parasitoids.",1243,N,ER,,,

Recently, it was found that chironomid   (noribiting midges) egg masses serve as a reservoir for the cholera   bacterium and that flying chironomid adults are possible windborne   carriers of V. cholerae non-O1 non-O139. Chironomids are the most widely   distributed insect in freshwater. Females deposit egg masses at the   water's edge, and each egg mass contains eggs embedded in a gelatinous   matrix. Hemagglutinin/protease, an extracellular enzyme of V. cholerae,   was found to degrade chironomid egg masses and to prevent them from   hatching. In a yearly survey, chironomid populations and the V. cholerae   in their egg masses followed phenological succession and interaction of   host-pathogen population dynamics. In this report, it is shown via FISH   technique that most of the V. cholerae inhabiting the egg mass are in   the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. The diversity of culturable   bacteria from chironomid egg masses collected from two freshwater   habitats was determined. In addition to V. cholerae, representatives of   the following genera were isolated: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas,   Klebsiella, Shewanella, Pseudomonas, Paracoccus, Exiguobacterium, and   unidentified bacteria. Three important human pathogens, Aeromonas   veronil, A. caviae, and A. hydrophila, were isolated from chironomid egg   masses, indicating that chironomid egg masses may be a natural reservoir   for pathogenic Aeromonas species in addition to V. cholerae. All   isolates of V. cholerae were capable of degrading chironomid egg masses.   This may help explain their host-pathogen relationship with chironomids.   In contrast, almost none of the other bacteria that were isolated from   the egg masses possessed this ability. Studying the interaction between   chironomid egg masses, the bacteria inhabiting them, and V. cholerae   could contribute to our understanding of the nature of the V.   cholerae-egg mass interactions.",1244,M,ER,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

The epilimnion and hypolimnion of 21 lakes differing in trophic   status and humic content were investigated. Samples were obtained for   viral and bacterial abundance, the FVIC and burst size, flagellate and   ciliate abundances and water chemistry. The potential importance of VBM   in relation to PGBM was calculated based on data on FVIC and flagellate   and ciliate abundance.   3. Partial least squares regression (PLS) analysis showed that VA as   well as the ratio between viral and bacterial abundance were positively   related to inorganic nutrient concentrations, dissolved organic carbon   concentration, chlorophyll-a concentration and bacterial production.   4. The PLS model also revealed that FVIC decreased with increasing   trophic status whereas BS increased. Furthermore, potential grazing was   positively related to increasing trophic status and decreasing humic   content. PGBM appeared to be dominating over VBM in the majority of   lakes sampled, especially in the epilimnion.   5. Thus, the relative importance of viruses for bacterial mortality was   potentially highest in humic lakes of medium trophic status and it was   also greater in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion.",1245,N,ER,,,

Within and between old-growth stands, variability in C density   is high and related to overstory tree species composition. The sites   contain 219 +/- 46 Mg C/ha (mean +/- SD), including live and dead   aboveground biomass, leaf litter, and the soil O horizon, with over 20\%   stored in downed wood and snags.

We used a   common-garden experiment and rDNA metabarcoding to examine the effect of   host relocation and high-latitude warming on the complex fungal   endophytic microbiome associated with leaves of an ecologically dominant   boreal forest tree (Populus balsamifera L.). We also considered the   potential effects of poplar genetic identity in defining the reactions   of the microbiome to the treatments. The relocation of hosts to the   north increased the diversity of the microbiome and influenced its   structure, with results indicating enemy release from plausible   pathogens. High-latitude warming decreased microbiome diversity in   comparison with natural northern conditions. The warming also caused   structural changes, which made the fungal communities distinct in   comparison with both low-latitude and high-latitude natural communities,   and increased the abundance of plausible pathogens. The reactions of the   microbiome to relocation and warming were strongly dependent on host   genetic identity.

Three potato   genotypes were compared: the cultivar Desiree, susceptible to the late   blight pathogen Phytoplithora infestans, a genetically modified cisgenic   clone of Desiree resistant to P. infestans and the cultivar Sarpo Mira,   also resistant to late blight. We aimed to test several ways to measure   biodiversity in the context of risk assessment by using both univariate   biodiversity indices and multivariate ordination methods, categorizing   the pitfall trap catch by taxonomic or functional category. The   Shannon-Wiener and Simpson biodiversity indices both showed strong   differences between sites, years and potato genotypes, but showed no   effects of the fungicide management regime. The effect of genotype was   due to cultivar differences between Desiree and Sarpo Mira rather than   between the GM-event (A15-31) and its isogenic comparator Desiree.   Multivariate permutation analyses and RDA ordination confirmed these   findings and also showed interactions between year, site and either   genotype or treatment. The added value of the multivariate analysis was   that it provided information on the specific arthropod groups or taxa   that contributed to community structure. Multivariate analyses are   recommended for use as a sensitive method to compare functionally   important arthropod groups driving community structure within the   framework of environmental risk assessments, or for the process of   indicator species selection.",1254,n,ER,,,

Here we assess the depth distribution of   protein clusters (PCs) in the first large-scale quantitative viral   metagenomic data set that spans much of the pelagic depth continuum (the   Pacific Ocean Virome; POV).

Taxonomic   annotation suggested that tailed phages are ubiquitous, but not abundant   (<5\% of PCs) and revealed depth-related taxonomic patterns. Functional   annotation, coupled with extensive analyses to document non-viral DNA   contamination, uncovered 32 new AMGs (9 core, 20 photic and 3 aphotic)   that introduce ways in which viruses manipulate infected host   metabolism, and parallel depth-stratified host adaptations (for example,   photic zone genes for iron-sulphur cluster modulation for phage   production, and aphotic zone genes for high-pressure deep-sea survival).   Finally, significant vertical flux of photic zone viruses to the deep   sea was detected, which is critical for interpreting depthrelated   patterns in nature.

In this study we have shown that the gene cluster   coding for the periplasmic nitrate reductase complex (nap) is highly   conserved in chemolithoautotrophic, nitrate-reducing   Epsilonproteobacteria from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Furthermore, we   have shown that the napA gene is expressed in pure cultures of vent   Epsilonproteobacteria and it is highly conserved in microbial   communities collected from deep-sea vents characterized by different   temperature and redox regimes. The diversity of nitrate-reducing   Epsilonproteobacteria was found to be higher in moderate temperature,   diffuse flow vents than in high temperature black smokers or in low   temperatures, substrate-associated communities. As NapA has a high   affinity for nitrate compared with the membrane-bound enzyme, its   occurrence in vent Epsilonproteobacteria may represent an adaptation of   these organisms to the low nitrate concentrations typically found in   vent fluids. Taken together, our findings indicate that nitrate   reduction is widespread in vent Epsilonproteobacteria and provide   insight on alternative energy metabolism in vent microorganisms. The   occurrence of the nap cluster in vent, commensal and pathogenic   Epsilonproteobacteria suggests that the ability of these bacteria to   respire nitrate is important in habitats as different as the deep-sea   vents and the human body.",1256,n,ER,,,

The fed pest cannot leave the cage nor the target pest   cannot enter the cage. The predator, however, can freely attack both the   fed and target pests in the target area. By introducing a refuge in the   cage against the predator for the fed pest, the fed pest and predator   may be stably sustained. In this study, we analyzed the potential   performance of this system by modeling the population dynamics of the   target pest, fed pest, and predator as differential equations. First, we   show analytically that the target pest can be suppressed at extremely   low abundance by adjusting both refuge efficiency and crop investment.   Second, we show numerically that crop damage by the pest may be   effectively suppressed by investing only small amounts of the crop.   Third, we show numerically that the magnitude of required crop   investment can be estimated by an index comprising of the predator's   searching cost for prey and the relative growth efficiency of the   predator with respect to the pest.

Simulated, approximately scale-free,   tiered horticultural trade networks consisting of growers, wholesalers,   and retailers were used to study the efficacy of quarantine inspection   and isolation procedures for reducing the spread of infected materials   to consumers. The quarantine algorithm temporarily isolated infected   nurseries from the rest of the trade network, rewiring the affected   trade connections to unquarantined nodes, until the infection was   reduced below the detection threshold, at which time the formerly   infected nursery was reincorporated into the trade network.   Nodes were inspected for infection at regular intervals. Increasing the   inspection interval resulted in higher levels of infection with large,   system-wide oscillations whose period that matched the inspection   interval. The timing of quarantine inspections of the largest hub in the   grower tier drove the dynamics of the entire network. Increasing the   proportion of growers or wholesalers increased infection level in most   networks. Increasing the connectivity within the grower and wholesaler   tiers led to large increases in mean infection levels.

Coastal habitats have begun to show symptoms of   ecological imbalance generally associated with multiple stressors caused   by pollution and habitat destruction: harmful algal blooms and fish   kills are of common occurrence in coastal areas, fish stocks are   declining, and coastal sediments are contaminated by a variety of toxic   chemicals. The present state of the Gulf ecosystem reflects the   constraints inherently associated with fragmented jurisdictions in the   management of coastal areas at both national and regional levels.

In view   of the complex, dynamic, and semi-enclosed nature of the Gulf ecosystem,   a paradigm shift from resource management characterized by short-term   perspectives on small spatial scales to resource management that is   ecosystem-based with long-term perspectives, is urgently needed.

Research so far mostly focused on direct, individual   abiotic or biotic effects on plant growth, but only few studies tested   the indirect effects of abiotic soil factors on plant growth. Therefore,   we investigated how abiotic soil conditions affect plant performance,   via changes induced by soil biota.   Methods   In a full-factorial experiment, we grew the widespread grass Dactylis   glomerata either with or without soil biota and investigated the impact   of soil temperature, fertility and moisture on the soil biota effects on   plant growth. We measured biomass production, root traits and   colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as well as microbial   respiration.   Important Findings   We found significant interaction effects between abiotic soil conditions   and soil biota on plant growth for fertility, but especially for soil   temperature, as an increase of 10 degrees C significantly changed the   soil biota effects on plant growth from positive to neutral. However, if   tested individually, an increase in soil temperature and fertility per   se positively affected plant biomass production, whereas soil biota per   se did not affect overall plant growth, but both influenced root   architecture. By affecting soil microbial activity and root   architecture, soil temperature might influence both mutualistic and   pathogenic interactions between plants and soil biota. Such soil   temperature effects should be considered in soil feedback studies to   ensure greater transferability of results from artificial and   experimental conditions to natural environmental conditions.",1260,n,ER,,,

We tested two prevalent assumptions driving   energetic modeling of predator kill rates: (1) morphological and   physiological information (weight, energetic demands of activity   patterns) of individual predators are sufficient to accurately predict   their kill rates, and (2) kill and consumption rates are equivalent   (meaning that carnivores consume all of what they kill). We did this by   testing whether two independent energetic models accurately predicted   puma (Puma concolor) kill and consumption rates in three study systems   in North and South America with variable ecology, including climate and   prey assemblages. Our results demonstrated that current puma energetic   models drastically underestimate actual puma kill rates quantified   through intensive field monitoring. We concluded that puma energetic   models more realistically estimate puma consumption rates needed to meet   metabolic requirements. Puma kill rates determined from field efforts   were not explained by puma weight (in kg) or activity patterns (in   distance traveled), which were the variables used in energetic models.   Our kill rates in kg/day determined from field investigations of GPS   clusters were the highest reported to date and statistically equivalent   across three distinct ecosystems, a range of puma characteristics,   variable lengths of monitoring, variable daily distances traveled, and   across systems with 1-3 ungulate prey. In contrast, puma kill rates in   ungulates/week differed across study areas, suggesting that kill rates   described in kilograms per day are better suited for comparing puma kill   rates across systems while kill rates in terms of ungulates per unit   time are better suited for modeling predator-prey dynamics for a   particular ecosystem. Based on these results we concluded that energetic   models using morphological and physiological variables alone were   insufficient to predict kill rates, and proposed that rather than   focusing future research on refining current energetic models, future   research should be directed at understanding the behavioral ecology   driving carnivore kill rates.",1261,n,ER,,,

These declines are occurring along a moving disease front in   Central America and offer the rare opportunity to quantify the   consequences of a sudden, dramatic decline in consumer diversity in a   natural system. As part of the Tropical Amphibian Declines in Streams   (TADS) project, we examined stream macroinvertebrate assemblage   structure and production for 2 y in 4 stream reaches at 2 sites in   Panama. One site initially had healthy amphibians but declined during   our study (El Cope), and 1 site already had experienced a decline in   1996 (Fortuna). During the 1(st) y, total macroinvertebrate abundance,   biomass, and production were generally similar among sites and showed no   consistent patterns between pre- and post-decline streams. However,   during the 2(nd) y, tadpole densities declined precipitously at El Cope,   and total macroinvertebrate production was significantly lower in the El   Cope streams than in Fortuna streams. Functional structure differed   between sites. Abundance, biomass, and production of filterers generally   were higher at Fortuna, and shredders generally were higher at El Cope.   However, shredder production declined significantly in both El Cope   reaches in the 2(nd) y as tadpoles declined. Nonmetric dimensional   scaling (NMDS) based on abundance and production indicated that   assemblages differed between sites, and patterns were linked to   variations in relative availability of basal resources. Our results   indicate that responses of remaining consumers to amphibian declines   might not be evident in coarse metrics (e.g., total abundance and   biomass), but functional and assemblage structure responses did occur.   Ongoing, long-term studies at these sites might reveal further   ecological consequences of the functional and taxonomic shifts we   observed.",1263,y,ER,yes,,

However, over the last two decades an exotic fungal disease ( dogwood   anthracnose, Discula destructiva) has decimated populations of this   once-common understory species. Its loss, combined with forest stand   development, could alter intra-stand calcium cycling. We used data from   long-term vegetation monitoring plots to examine the ecological role of   C. florida in calcium cycling and to identify changes in annual foliar   calcium cycling over a 20-year period between two sampling intervals,   1977-1979 (pre-anthracnose) and 1995-2000 (post-anthracnose). Published   equations were used to estimate foliar biomass per species for five   forest types: alluvial, typic cove, acid cove, oak-hickory, and   oak-pine. Calcium concentrations derived from foliage samples were used   to estimate annual foliar calcium production per species for understory   woody stems (< 20 cm dbh) and total foliar calcium production for   overstory stems (>= 20 cm dbh). At a given level of soil calcium   availability, C. florida foliage contained greater concentrations of   calcium than three other dominant understory species (Tsuga canadensis,   Acer rubrum, and Rhododendron maximum). Between 1977-1979 and 1995-2000,   the annual calcium contributions of understory woody vegetation declined   across all forest types, ranging from 26\% in oak-pine stands to 49\% in   acid coves. Loss of C. florida was responsible for only 13\% of this   decline in oak-pine stands, but accounted for 96\% of the decline in   typic coves. In oak-hickory and oak-pine stands, we observed large   increases in the foliar biomass of T. canadensis, a species whose   calcium-poor foliage increases soil acidity. Increases in overstory   foliar biomass and calcium offset understory losses in three forest   types (alluvial, typic coves, and oak-pine) but not in oak hickory and   acid cove stands. Overall, calcium cycling in oak-hickory stands was   more negatively affected by the loss of C. florida than the other forest   types. Oak-hickory forests comprise over a third of the total forest   cover in the eastern United States, and decreases in annual calcium   cycling could have cascading effects on forest biota.",1264,m,ER,yes,,

There is a   growing interest in including forest management practices to control or   manage invasives. Rather than adhere to traditional silvicultural   practices, invasive species management approaches should be tailored to   the specific circumstances, e.g. invasion intensity, long-term   management goals, and role of the invasive, e.g., defoliator, direct   mortality agent, host stressor. Pre-emptive silvicultural approaches   correspond well with ecological principles of maintaining host vigor,   both in plantations and natural forests. As invasive species dominate   some ecosystems and influence ecosystem processes, the use of   silviculture as a restoration tool gains importance. Restoration   following invasive species damage may involve shifts in species   composition (non-hosts) to maintain or create resilient forest   communities. Evidence of successful use of silviculture to minimize   damage from invasive species remains limited, and although dwarfed by   other control efforts, such as biological control, silvicultural   practices should be integrated into comprehensive management of invasive   species.

Higher   trophic levels in soil food webs can play a role suppressing plant   parasites and affecting nutrient dynamics by modifying abundance of   intermediate consumers. Natural and agricultural landscapes were sampled   to compare soil faunal structure. Top-down soil suppressiveness of a   parasitic nematode. Meloidogyne incognita, was determined in laboratory   assay. Five treatments, including two nitrogen fertilizers, two   herbicides and simulated tillage were established in experimental   microcosms to evaluate the effects of simulated agricultural practices   on top-down suppressiveness. Soil food web indices, based on the   composition of the nematode fauna, were calculated to infer soil food   web condition. Long and complex soil food webs in natural areas, with   more trophic links and abundant predatory nematodes, effectively   suppressed plant-parasite populations, while disturbed communities in   agricultural soils did not. Soil suppressiveness was related to the   ratio of predators to prey and to the prevalence of omnivore and   predator species. Agricultural management led to a reduction in the   suppressive capacity of the soil food web. Abundance of predatory   nematodes was related to soil NH4+, probably due to excretory products   of nematodes and other organisms grazing on microbes.

Isolation from woody habitats reduced species richness and   abundance of natural enemies more strongly than of their hosts, so that   parasitism rate was lowered by half in isolated sites compared to forest   edges.

Five platforms were   surveyed; only two were found to possess populations large enough to   sample - GI-93C and MC-280A. Tissue samples were collected and analyzed   via Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). STRUCTURE analysis   identified four genetically distinct clusters or groups among the two   platforms. The MC-280A population exhibited an overwhelming association   with only one genetic group. Although the three other groups were   represented, they were present in small proportions - 1-5\%. By   contrast, the GI-93C population showed high genetic diversity, with   colonies exhibiting association with all four groups in widely varying   proportions. The lack of genetic variability on MC-280A most likely   resulted from a single recruitment event on this more isolated platform.   It is possible that this event could have been derived from a second   invasion of this species. In that case, treatment of the invasive would   best be focused on the species at the vector point (e.g., treating the   hull or ballast water of a ship prior to reaching its destination)   rather than in the already infected environment, to avoid repeated   replacement invasions. On GI-93-C, the genetic variability was most   likely the result of multiple recruitment events. Other possible factors   causing the observed pattern could include recruitment from genetically   diverse populations in the region and sampling from an older age   population where reproduction could result in admixture.

Short-term fumigation affected the   levels of two phenolic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxybenzoic and   3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids, in that both showed a substantial decrease   in concentration with increased ozone dose. The decrease in   concentration of these THM products may be caused by inhibition of the   plant's shikimate biochemical pathway caused by ozone exposure. The   combined occurrence of these two ozone-sensitive indicators has a role   in biomonitoring of ozone levels and its impact on forest productivity.

Increased food   production remains a cornerstone strategy in the effort to alleviate   global food insecurity. But despite the fact that global food production   over the past half century has kept ahead of demand, today around one   billion people do not have enough to eat, and a further billion lack   adequate nutrition. Food insecurity is facing mounting supply-side and   demand-side pressures; key among these are climate change, urbanisation,   globalisation, population increases, disease, as well as a number of   other factors that are changing patterns of food consumption. Many of   the challenges to equitable food access are concentrated in developing   countries where environmental pressures including climate change,   population growth and other socio-economic issues are concentrated.   Together these factors impede people's access to sufficient, nutritious   food; chiefly through affecting livelihoods, income and food prices.   Food security and human development go hand in hand, and their outcomes   are co-determined to a significant degree. The challenge of food   security is multi-scalar and cross-sector in nature. Addressing it will   require the work of diverse actors to bring sustained improvements   inhuman development and to reduce pressure on the environment. Unless   there is investment in future food systems that are similarly   cross-level, cross-scale and cross-sector, sustained improvements in   human wellbeing together with reduced environmental risks and scarcities   will not be achieved. This paper reviews current thinking, and outlines   these challenges. It suggests that essential elements in a successfully   adaptive and proactive food system include: learning through   connectivity between scales to local experience and technologies high   levels of interaction between diverse actors and sectors ranging from   primary producers to retailers and consumers, and use of frontier   technologies.",1273,n,ER,,,

Protected-area networks have tremendous potential   to support coordinated resource protection, disease surveillance, and   population monitoring that could become a cornerstone of 21st-century   bat conservation. To motivate this idea, we develop a macroecological   perspective about bat diversity and associated conservation challenges   and opportunities on U.S. National Park Service (NPS) lands. We compared   occurrence records from parks against published range maps. Only 55   (19\%) of parks reported as present >= 90\% of the bat species expected   based on range maps, highlighting the information-gap challenge.   Discrepancies suggest substantial under-reporting and under-sampling of   bats on NPS lands; inadequate range maps and habitat specificity are   implicated for some species. Despite these discrepancies, 50 species,   including several range-restricted and endangered taxa, were reported in   at least one park unit, including those in the Caribbean and tropical   Pacific. Species richness increased with park area at a rate (z) of   similar to 0.1, a pattern confounded by covariation with latitude,   elevation, and habitat. When accounting for these factors, richness   decreased predictably at higher latitudes and increased at   mid-elevations and with greater numbers of keystone underground habitat   structures (caves and mines), reflecting a strong species-energy   relationship. The inclusion of covariates that represented percentage of   natural vs. human-modified (converted) landscapes and elevation range-a   proxy for environmental heterogeneity-was uninformative. White-nose   syndrome (WNS) presents a tremendous challenge to the NPS: All 12   species currently known to be affected by the disease or to host the   causal fungus are represented in the NPS system. One hundred and   twenty-seven NPS parks are in counties currently or likely to become   WNS-positive by 2026. All parks are expected to experience increasing   temperatures in coming decades; forecasted climate change velocity is   particularly high (>1 SD) for 50 parks. Seventeen parks are in the   vicinity of high (>1 SD) wind turbine density. Based on these   biogeographic patterns, we suggest ways to prioritize NPS parks for   additional inventories, monitoring, and resource protection. Our results   demonstrate how macroecology and bioinformatics together can guide   strategic conservation capacity-building among protected areas.",1274,n,ER,,,

Supplemental feeding, however, is   likely to increase the transmission of brucellosis in elk, and may be   affected by climatic factors, such as snowpack. We assessed these   possibilities using snowpack and feeding data from 1952 to 2006 and   disease testing data from 1993 to 2006. Brucellosis seroprevalence was   strongly correlated with the timing of the feeding season. Longer   feeding seasons were associated with higher seroprevalence, but elk   population size and density had only minor effects. In other words, the   duration of host aggregation and whether it coincided with peak   transmission periods was more important than just the host population   size. Accurate modeling of disease transmission depends upon   incorporating information on how host contact rates fluctuate over time   relative to peak transmission periods. We also found that supplemental   feeding seasons lasted longer during years with deeper snowpack.   Therefore, milder winters and/or management strategies that reduce the   length of the feeding season may reduce the seroprevalence of   brucellosis in the elk populations of the southern GYE.",1275,n,ER,,,

The results of statistical analyses show that ridge regression   (RR) outperformed the two other modelling methods, principal component   regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS).

To   date research has mainly focussed on the protection of trees of economic   importance. In most countries the major portion of research costs tend   to be borne by the state with governments funding tree health research   and the implementation of statutory work (risk assessment, border   inspection and surveillance), whilst commercial enterprises cover the   costs of ongoing management of established pests and pathogens. The   costs of responding to new outbreaks tend to be shared with government   or regional authorities organising initial response but owners covering   subsequent operational costs without state compensation. However in   recent years a number of major epidemics have devastated natural   ecosystems and landscapes valued both for timber and for their wider   benefits to the general public. Against this background it is helpful to   consider more explicitly the consequences of pests and pathogens for the   full range of ecosystem services. Biodiversity was originally perceived   to be an ecosystem service but is now recognised as fundamental in   supporting ecological function. Many ecosystem services are uncosted and   enjoyed by a range of stakeholders raising important questions about who   is responsible for measures to protect tree health. We present data here   on the new outbreaks which have occurred in the UK and, as an example of   rapid spread of a disease, on the development of Hymenoscyphus fraxineus   in the UK over the last 3 years. These data indicate that tree pests and   diseases represent a major contemporary problem to which the ecosystem   services concept, and its associated implications for cost sharing, can   move forward our approach to prevention and outbreak management and may   improve the outcomes of international measures to minimise the   man-mediated movement and impacts of pests and pathogens.",1278,n,ER,,,

Flower visitors of   wildflower plantings encompass many ecologically and economically   important species. However, most studies on flower visitors of   wildflower plantings have focused on single or few prominent taxa (e.g.,   wild bees and hoverflies). In contrast, it remains largely unresolved   how non-prominent flower visitors of the community are affected by   wildflower resources, landscape context and time of the flowering   season. We studied highly diverse flower-visitor communities on 14   wildflower plantings varying in flower abundance and richness and their   surrounding landscape context within a 500 m radius (percentage arable   land, presence of additional wildflower plantings). Flower visitors were   sampled in the early (May-June) and late (June-July) flowering season   and grouped as follows: managed honeybees, wild bees, hoverflies, all   other flower visitors. Strikingly, only 81 (25.1\%) of all 322 visiting   species (<50.0\% of individuals) were bees or hoverflies, and 241   non-prominent `other' visitor taxa were sampled, encompassing many   ecologically and economically important species, e.g., parasitic wasps   and non-syrphid Diptera. With the exception of honeybee abundance that   was positively related to flower abundance, flower abundance and   richness of wildflower plantings affected neither abundance nor richness   of any visitor group. While a high amount of surrounding arable land   decreased species richness of wild bees, richness of all other groups   was unaffected. In contrast to the relatively weak abundance and   richness responses at the group-level, we found strong species-specific   responses to landscape context, resulting in substantial spatial and   temporal turnover in community composition. In the early flowering   season, wildflower plantings that were accompanied by additional local   plantings and embedded within complex landscapes supported the highest   abundances of habitat specialists (e.g. Bombus spp.), whereas isolated   plantings were predominantly visited by agricultural generalists (e.g.   predatory hoverflies and pollen beetles). These compositional   differences diminished towards the end of the flowering season. Our   study highlights the great conservation potential of wildflower   plantings in agricultural landscapes. With the exception of wild bees,   wildflower plantings support a high diversity of   functionallycomplementary flower-visitor species from complex to   structurally simple agricultural landscapes. These so-far overlooked   flower visitors may have the potential to provide complementary   ecosystem services and to step-in in agricultural settings where   prominent providers have been lost. Assessments of the value of   wildflower plantings to biodiversity conservation and agriculture   require a shift away from solely focusing on prominent taxa and towards   a more holistic appreciation of the entire flower-visitor community.

The objective of this study was to investigate the regrowth   potential of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Listeria   monocytogenes in dairy-based composts under different environmental   conditions. Water extract of commercially available dairy compost was   used as a model system. Cocktails of five rifampin-resistant strains of   each pathogen previously grown in reduced nutrient media (1/2 or 1/10   strength of tryptic soy broth, TSB) were inoculated into water extract   of compost of different ratios (1:2,1:5, and 1:10, w/v), and then stored   at 35A degrees C or 22A degrees C for 7 days. The strains exhibiting   greatest survival or regrowth were identified by pulsed-field gel   electrophoresis (PFGE). At 22A degrees C, both E. coli O157:H7 and L.   monocytogenes multiplied in all compost extracts, whereas Salmonella   spp. regrew in both 1:2 and 1:5 compost extracts but not in 1:10. For   all three pathogens, incubation at 22A degrees C provides better   conditions for regrowth than at 35A degrees C. Both Salmonella and E.   coli O157:H7 previously adapted to nutrient-limited broth (1/10 strength   of TSB) regrew in compost extracts to higher populations than the   control cultures grown previously in full strength of TSB. In the   absence of indigenous microorganisms, all three pathogens regrew even in   the most diluted sterile compost extract (1:10) with growth potentials   ranging from 2.30 to 3.59 log CFU/ml. In nonsterile compost extract with   ca. 5 log CFU/ml of background microorganisms, all three pathogens   regrew only in the most concentrated compost extract (1:2) with much   less population increases ranging from 0.70 to 1.43 log CFU/ml. Compost   extract samples of all ages supported the regrowth of both Salmonella   and E. coli O157:H7 with population increases ranging from 0.95 to 2.32   log CFU/ml. The PFGE patterns for E. coli O157:H7 isolates from sterile   compost extracts matched with either the spinach outbreak strain or an   avirulent B6914 strain. These results demonstrated that compost extract   of dairy-based compost contained sufficient nutrients for pathogen   regrowth. Cultures previously adapted to low nutrient media regrew to   higher populations than control cultures; however, indigenous microflora   suppressed the pathogen regrowth in compost extract, especially at 35A   degrees C.",1280,n,ER,,,

Further, we estimated that natural recovery would   take more than 100 years to reach the areal coverage achieved by   restoration using seeds in just 10 years. Restoration enhanced this   recovery, and the earlier establishment of plants results in a net gain   of at least 4,100 ton of nitrogen removed from the system via   denitrification and 15,000 ton of carbon sequestered in the sediment.

Here,   they grow mostly in separate populations, posing the question why they   have not merged. In a 2-year reciprocal transplant experiment, we tested   whether the two plant types prefer different habitats and are adapted to   these, possibly influenced by selection by herbivores. Vegetation and   soil analyses indicated that the G-type occurs in slightly drier, less   productive and more alkaline sites than the P-type. Plants planted at   sites of their own chemotype had a higher biomass in the first year than   plants of the nonresident chemotype, but were more damaged by beetle   herbivory. This suggests that herbivores have adapted genetically or   plastically to the resident chemotype. G-plants were less damaged by   molluscs than P-plants, which may be caused by their content of saponins   or glucosinolates. Levels of glucosinolates in siliques were higher in   G-plants, but varied strongly among sites. Survival, reproduction and   biomass in the second year did not differ between plants growing at   sites of their own chemotype and plants of the other chemotype.

While long periodic   cycles in population dynamics can make the experimental observation of   the indirect effects difficult, modelling the possible effects on an   evolutionary tithe scale may provide the much needed information on the   potential threats of the invasive species on the ecosystem. Using   empirical data from a recent invasion in northernmost Fennoscandia, we   applied adaptive dynamics theory and modelled the long term consequences   of the invasion by the winter moth into the resident community.   Specifically, we investigated the outcome of the observed short-term   asymmetric preferences of generalist predators and specialist   parasitoids on the long term population dynamics of the invasive winter   moth and resident autumnal moth sharing these natural enemies. Our   results indicate that coexistence after the invasion is possible.   However, the outcome of the indirect interaction on the population   dynamics of the moth species was variable and the dynamics might not be   persistent on an evolutionary time scale. In addition, the indirect   interactions between the two moth species via shared natural enemies   were able to cause asynchrony in the population cycles corresponding to   field observations from previous sympatric outbreak areas. Therefore,   the invasion may cause drastic changes in the resident community, for   example by prolonging outbreak periods of birch-feeding moths,   increasing the average population densities of the moths or,   alternatively, leading to extinction of the resident moth species or to   equilibrium densities of the two, formerly cyclic, herbivores.

We developed and tested a biomass-specific, multi-species   model to examine the role of PSFs in diversity-productivity   relationships. The model predicts a negative relationship between PSFs   and overyielding: plants with negative PSFs grow more in communities   than in monoculture (i.e. overyield), and plants with positive PSFs grow   less in communities than in monoculture (i.e. underyield). This effect   is predicted to increase with diversity and saturate at low species   richness because the proportion of `self-cultivated' soils rapidly   decreases as species are added to a community. Results in a set of   glasshouse experiments supported model predictions.

Parasite population growth and invasion success are generally explained   by host density dependence, while the direct influence of environmental   factors on parasite life history traits has been underreported. 2. In   waterbodies, resource availability and environmental conditions change   with season (temperature, irradiance and rainfall patterns) and with   depth (light, temperature and chemical gradients). Hence, hosts and   parasites live in a spatially and temporally variable environment. Such   environmental variation leads to structured populations, which in turn   have implications for hostparasite interaction dynamics. Nevertheless,   time-series data on the vertical distribution of aquatic hosts and their   parasites are rare. 3. We present a dataset spanning 1.5years (20082010)   of weekly sampling in Lake Maarsseveen (the Netherlands) focussing on   the dynamics of the diatom Asterionella formosa and its parasite, the   chytrid Zygorhizidium planktonicum, at four depths. Environmental   variables measured included ice cover, temperature, global irradiance,   light extinction, pH, soluble reactive silicate (SRSi), dissolved   nitrate and ortho-phosphate. 4. We observed four host blooms, two in   early spring and one each in summer and autumn. Each host bloom was   followed by a time-lagged parasite epidemic. Blooms and epidemics   started in the uppermost water layers and showed a time lag in onset   date with increasing depth. 5. Host abundance was related to SRSi,   global irradiance, Schmidt stability and parasite abundance in the upper   10m, whereas at 15m only a relationship with parasite abundance   prevailed. Parasite abundance was related to host abundance, light   extinction, temperature, SRSi, stability and global irradiance within   the upper 10m; again, at 15m, parasite abundance correlated only with   host abundance and disease prevalence. 6. Host vertical distribution was   less aggregated during isothermal conditions than during thermal   stratification, when host abundance was higher in the mixed, photic   epilimnion and lower in the dark, colder hypolimnion. Parasite vertical   distribution was patchy most of the year. Parasite epidemics seemed to   reduce host vertical patchiness as they impacted higher density patches   in the photic zone more strongly, a result of both higher host abundance   and favourable environmental conditions for the parasite. 7. Seasonal   variability and vertical gradients in biotic and abiotic factors expose   host and parasite individuals to different environmental conditions even   within a single population. Environmental variability affects parasite   transmission rates through changes in host abundance and through changes   in the strength and outcome of hostparasite interactions.",1287,no,ER,,,

Previous studies have made   considerable progress in elucidating local factors that contribute to   seed predation by acorn weevils, but it is still not clear how habitat   configurations interplay with local factors in influencing Curculio   predation. In this study, we assessed the roles of crop size, landscape   configurations (area and isolation) and their interactions on the   predation rate of seeds by acorn weevils.   Methods We studied acorn weevils feeding on the seeds of Castanopsis   sclerophylla (Fagaceae) on two peninsulas and nine islands with varying   areas and isolation levels in the Thousand-island Lake in Chun'an   County, Zhejiang Province of China. Overall, crop size was estimated for   130 trees and predation status was assessed for 26 207 seeds from these   trees during two years. Generalized linear mixed models were performed   to clarify how island area and isolation interplayed with crop size to   determine predation rate on a single tree.   Important Findings A negative relationship was detected between crop   size and seed predation rate, indicating predator satiation at the tree   level. This suggests that acorn weevils tend to stay sedentary once they   have arrived at a suitable habitat. Habitat fragmentation had   significant effects on seed predation such that predation rate was   higher on larger, less isolated islands. Furthermore, the relationship   between crop size and predation rate was significantly changed by both   island area and isolation. This finding highlighted that the effects of   habitat isolation might be overlooked relative to those of habitat loss.",1288,no,ER,,,

We examined how infestation by an eriophyoid gall   mite affects the circumpolar shrub Salix arctica, and how the effects   vary across vegetation types. Specifically, we compared multiple leaf   characteristics (leaf area, biomass, nutrient levels, delta N-15 and   delta C-13, and stress and performance of the photosynthetic apparatus)   of infested leaves to those of un-infested leaves. Furthermore, we   examined how altered environmental conditions, here experimentally   manipulated levels of temperature, water and nutrients, shading, and   UV-B radiation, affect the prevalence, density, and intensity of gall   mite infestation and its impacts on S. arctica. Infested leaves were   smaller in area and biomass and had lower nitrogen and carbon pools.   However, their carbon concentration was higher, possibly because the   galls acted as carbon sinks. The smaller photosynthetic area and lower   nutrient content caused increased stress on the photosynthetic apparatus   in infested leaves. The remaining leaf tissue responded with a higher   photosynthetic performance, although there were indications of a general   reduction in photosynthesis. Female leaves were more affected than male   leaves. The experimental manipulations of environmental conditions did   not affect the gall prevalence, density, or intensity on S. arctica   leaves. Rather, plants responded positively to the treatments, reducing   the effects of the galls to in-significance.

Alternative models   propose nonadditive effects through the selective matching of compatible   genomes. If genetic incompatibility, for example, through hybridization,   inbreeding, or selfish genetic elements, reduces viability of offspring,   selection should favor pre- or postcopulatory mechanisms of inbreeding   avoidance. Postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance might be achieved by   polyandry in combination with cryptic female choice. Because female   spiders have paired and independent sperm storage organs that are only   filled one at a time, they have been suggested to be ideal organisms to   investigate cryptic female choice. Here we used orb-web spiders of the   Mediterranean species Argiope lobata to investigate whether females   treat ejaculates from siblings or nonsiblings differently. In   double-mating trials using sibling and nonsibling males in all possible   combinations, we experimentally manipulated which male mated into which   sperm storage organ and subsequently counted spermatozoa in these   storage organs. This experimental design allowed us to unambiguously   assign ejaculates to individual males. We found no differential storage   of sperm from first males but a significantly reduced amount of stored   sperm from the second male if he was a sibling.

Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists from the time of   Charles Elton in the 1920s. The discovery of large population   fluctuations in undisturbed ecosystems challenged the idea that pristine   nature was in a state of balance. The 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares   (Lepus americanus Erxleben) across the boreal forests of Canada and   Alaska is a classic cycle, recognized by fur traders for more than   300years.   2. Since the 1930s, ecologists have investigated the mechanisms that   might cause these cycles. Proposed causal mechanisms have varied from   sunspots to food supplies, parasites, diseases, predation and social   behaviour. Both the birth rate and the death rate change dramatically   over the cycle. Social behaviour was eliminated as a possible cause   because snowshoe hares are not territorial and do not commit   infanticide.   3. Since the 1960s, large-scale manipulative experiments have been used   to discover the major limiting factors. Food supply and predation   quickly became recognized as potential key factors causing the cycle.   Experiments adding food and restricting predator access to field   populations have been decisive in pinpointing predation as the key   mechanism causing these fluctuations.   4. The immediate cause of death of most snowshoe hares is predation by a   variety of predators, including the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis Kerr).   The collapse in the reproductive rate is not due to food shortage as was   originally thought, but is a result of chronic stress from predator   chases.   5. Five major issues remain unresolved. First, what is the nature of the   predator-induced memory that results in the prolonged low phase of the   cycle? Second, why do hare cycles form a travelling wave, starting in   the centre of the boreal forest in Saskatchewan and travelling across   western Canada and Alaska? Third, why does the amplitude of the cycle   vary greatly from one cycle to the next in the same area? Fourth, do the   same mechanisms of population limitation apply to snowshoe hares in   eastern North American or in similar ecosystems across Siberia? Finally,   what effect will climatic warming have on all the above issues? The   answers to these questions remain for future generations of biologists   to determine.",1293,no,ER,,,

By combining   season-long pesticide applications of various insecticides and   fungicides into a metric based on the International Organization for   Biological and Integrated Control (IOBC) toxicity ratings, we evaluate   season-long pesticide impacts on communities of indigenous and exotic   arthropods across 61 vineyards assessed for an entire growing season.   The composition of arthropod communities, identified mostly at the   family level, but in some cases at the species level, was altered   depending on season-long pesticide use. Numbers of mostly indigenous   parasitoids, predatory mites, and coccinellids in the canopy, as well as   carabid/tenebrionid beetles and some spider families on the ground, were   decreased at higher cumulative pesticide metric scores. In contrast,   numbers of one invasive millipede species (Ommatoiulus moreletti Lucas,   Julida: Julidae) increased under higher cumulative pesticide metric   scores. These changing community patterns were detected despite the   absence of broad-spectrum insecticide applications in the vineyards.   Pesticide effects were mostly due to indoxacarb and sulphur, applied as   a fungicide. The reduction of beneficial arthropods and increase in an   invasive herbivorous millipede under high cumulative pesticide metric   scores highlights the need to manage nontarget season-long pesticide   impacts in vineyards. A cumulative pesticide metric, based on IOBC   toxicity ratings, provides a way of assessing overall toxicity effects,   giving managers a means to estimate and consider potential negative   season-long pesticide impacts on ecosystem services provided through   arthropod communities.",1294,no,ER,,,

However,   large-scale anomalous events, such as those occurring in Commonwealth   Bay, East Antarctica, provide opportunities for natural experiments.   Historically, katabatic winds have kept Commonwealth Bay ice-free for   most of each year, but since 2010, a massive grounded iceberg has   resulted in year-round sea-ice cover. We surveyed benthic communities in   Commonwealth Bay approximately 3 years after continuous sea-ice cover   began and found algal bed communities in severe decline. The majority   (similar to 75 \%) of large macroalgae were decomposing, and the   remainder were discoloured or bleached, while approximately 40 \% of   encrusting coralline algae were bleached.

Despite considerable study, the selective   advantage of alarm cues remains unclear. In an attempt to investigate   one of the more promising hypotheses concerning the evolution of alarm   cues, we examined whether the cue functions in a fashion analogous to   the distress vocalizations emitted by many terrestrial animals. Our   results suggest that chemical alarm cues in damselfish (Pomacentridae)   may have evolved to benefit the cue sender by attracting secondary   predators who disrupt the predation event, allowing the prey a greater   chance to escape. The coral reef piscivore, the dusky dottyback   (Pseudochromis fuscus), chemically eavesdrops on predation events and   uses chemical alarm cues from fish prey (lemon damselfish; Pomacentrus   moluccensis) in an attempt to find and steal prey from primary   predators. Field studies showed that Ps. fuscus aggregate at sites where   prey alarm cue has been experimentally released. Furthermore, secondary   predators attempted to steal captured prey of primary predators in   laboratory trials and enhanced prey escape chances by 35-40\%. These   results are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to demonstrate a   mechanism by which marine fish may benefit from the production and   release of alarm cues, and highlight the complex and important role that   semiochemicals play in marine predator-prey interactions.",1296,no,ER,,,

However, in complex, highly connected   systems, such as marine environments connected by ocean currents,   populations spread dynamically in both space and time via transient   connectivity links. This results in nondeterministic future   distributions of species in which local populations emerge dynamically   and concurrently over a large area. The challenge, therefore, is to   choose intervention locations that will maximize the effectiveness of   the control efforts. We propose a novel method to manage dynamic species   invasions and outbreaks that identifies the intervention locations most   likely to curtail population expansion by selectively targeting local   populations most likely to expand their future range. Critically, at any   point during the development of the invasion or outbreak, the method   identifies the local intervention that maximizes the long-term benefit   across the ecosystem by restricting species' potential to spread. In so   doing, the method adaptively selects the intervention targets under   dynamically changing circumstances. To illustrate the effectiveness of   the method we applied it to controlling the spread of crown-of-thorns   starfish (Acanthaster sp.) outbreaks across Australia's Great Barrier   Reef. Application of our method resulted in an 18-fold relative   improvement in management outcomes compared with a random targeting of   reefs in putative starfish control scenarios. Although we focused on   applying the method to reducing the spread of an unwanted species, it   can also be used to facilitate the spread of desirable species through   connectivity networks. For example, the method could be used to select   those fragments of habitat most likely to rebuild a population if they   were sufficiently well protected.   Control de la Expansion de la Extension en las Redes de Habitats al   Enfocarse Adaptativamente en las Poblaciones Fuente El control de la   dispersion de las especies invasoras, las plagas y los patogenos   generalmente esta limitado logisticamente a las intervenciones que se   enfocan en localidades especificas durante periodos especificos. Sin   embargo, en sistemas complejos y muy bien conectados, como los ambientes   marinos conectados por las corrientes oceanicas, las poblaciones se   dispersan de manera dinamica tanto en el espacio como en el tiempo a   traves de enlaces transitorios de conectividad. Lo anterior resulta en   una distribucion futura no-determinista de las especies, en la que las   poblaciones locales emergen dinamica y concurrentemente en toda la   cobertura de un area grande. Por lo tanto, el reto es elegir localidades   de intervencion que maximizaran la efectividad de los esfuerzos de   control. Proponemos un metodo novedoso para manejar las invasiones   dinamicas de las especies y los brotes, el cual identifica las   localidades de intervencion con mayor probabilidad de restringir las   expansiones poblacionales al enfocarse selectivamente en las poblaciones   locales con mayor probabilidad de expandir su extension futura. En   cualquier momento del desarrollo de la invasion o el brote, el metodo   identifica de manera critica a la intervencion local que maximiza el   beneficio a largo plazo en todo el ecosistema al restringir el potencial   de dispersion de la especie. Al hacer esto, el metodo selecciona   adaptativamente a los objetivos de la intervencion bajo circunstancias   cambiantes de forma dinamica. Para ilustrar la efectividad del metodo,   lo aplicamos al control de la dispersion de los brotes de la estrella de   mar Acanthaster sp. en la Gran Barrera Arrecifal.

Bison are infected with brucellosis   (Brucella abortus) and their seasonal movements can expose livestock to   infection. Yellowstone National Park has embarked on a program of   adaptive management of bison, which requires a model that assimilates   data to support management decisions. We constructed a Bayesian   state-space model to reveal the influence of brucellosis on the   Yellowstone bison population. A frequency-dependent model of brucellosis   transmission was superior to a density-dependent model in predicting   out-of-sample observations of horizontal transmission probability. A   mixture model including both transmission mechanisms converged on   frequency dependence. Conditional on the frequency-dependent model,   brucellosis median transmission rate was 1.87 yr(-1). The median of the   posterior distribution of the basic reproductive ratio (R-0) was 1.75.   Seroprevalence of adult females varied around 60\% over two decades, but   only 9.6 of 100 adult females were infectious. Brucellosis depressed   recruitment; estimated population growth rate averaged 1.07 for an   infected population and 1.11 for a healthy population. We used five-year   forecasting to evaluate the ability of different actions to meet   management goals relative to no action. Annually removing 200   seropositive female bison increased by 30-fold the probability of   reducing seroprevalence below 40\% and increased by a factor of 120 the   probability of achieving a 50\% reduction in transmission probability   relative to no action. Annually vaccinating 200 seronegative animals   increased the likelihood of a 50\% reduction in transmission probability   by fivefold over no action. However, including uncertainty in the   ability to implement management by representing stochastic variation in   the number of accessible bison dramatically reduced the probability of   achieving goals using interventions relative to no action. Because the   width of the posterior predictive distributions of future population   states expands rapidly with increases in the forecast horizon, managers   must accept high levels of uncertainty. These findings emphasize the   necessity of iterative, adaptive management with relatively short-term   commitment to action and frequent reevaluation in response to new data   and model forecasts.

To   consider gene flow, we performed spatial analyses and compared   F-statistics from our data to those from a wide range of species and   functional groups. We tested the predictions of biogeographic theory by   quantifying associations of genetic diversity with ``island'' area and   isolation from ``mainland'' populations.

The viable cell count of all   the bioformulations was determined at the end of 60, 120, 180, 240, 300,   and 360 days of incubation (DAI) at room temperature. The viability of   bacterial inoculants was found to be maximum in vermiculite based   bioformulations after 180 days of storage (DAS). These PGP bacterial   based bioformulations were found to bestow a statistically significant   increase in the vegetative growth parameters of the test plant species;   however, the best results were obtained in case of vermiculite based   consortial bioformulations as compared to individual bioformulation and   control trials that used bioformulations without any inoculant PGP   strain.

We   hypothesized that this inconsistency is caused, at least in part, by the   following two aspects. One is that a competitive advantage might occur   as a result of an increase in storage compounds for both growth and   defense. Another is that the effect of the endophyte might be related to   both water availability and host density. In a greenhouse experiment, we   compared the competitive abilities of endophyte-infected (El) and   endophyte-free (EF) Leymus chinensis, a dominant grass native to the   Inner Mongolia Steppe of China, subjected to ten treatments comprised of   a factorial combination of two levels of water availability   (well-watered and drought) and five proportions of EI to EF plants   (12:0, 4:8, 6:6, 8:4, 0:12). The results showed that the competitive   ability of EI plants was higher than that of EF under drought. Here,   greater belowground biomass and water use efficiency might contribute to   better competitiveness of EI plants. When competing under well-watered   conditions, endophyte infection did not provide a benefit to the host   plant in biomass accumulation, but more carbon was allocated to defense   (total phenolics) in El plants. This scenario could help El plants   suffer less damage than EF when exposed to herbivores in natural   habitats. The competitive ability of EI plants was regulated by EI:EF   ratios. Competitive ability of El plants was higher than that of EF   plants in mixtures with lower numbers of El plants, but the beneficial   effect of endophyte infection was neutralized in mixtures with higher   numbers of El plants. Overall, endophyte infection improved the   competitive ability of the host under either drought or well -watered   conditions but in the presence of herbivore, only this benefit was   neutralized by increasing ratios of EI plants. We suspect that both the   conditional beneficial effects and stabilizing effects of density   differences are likely to keep the endophyte infection rate of L.   chinensis at an intermediate level.

Small-sized (low R*) juveniles   may thus exclude their larger-sized (high R*) parents in resource   competition, resulting in apparent semelparous life histories and   non-overlapping generations. However, empirical support for such a   competition-driven semelparity (CDS) remains scarce. Here, we report a   high consistency of cohort dynamics with CDS in wild medaka (Oryzias   latipes). As predicted by the theory, there was a strong juvenile-adult   diet overlap, and all individuals died after reproduction as semelparous   age-1 adults, synchronous with a rapid somatic growth of age-0 juveniles   into the adult stage and with dropping abundances of zooplankton food   resources. In addition to the theory, we found evidence for increased   reproductive allocation under food stress, translating into immune   depression and elevated parasite prevalence. Therefore, CDS in medaka   emerges both from intercohort competitive exclusion and from   food-dependent energy reallocation from maintenance to reproduction, the   later presumably representing an adaptive response to the former. The   literature data show that the strengths of both intercohort competition   and reproductive allocation increase at higher temperatures in many   ectotherms, pointing to climate warming as a potentially powerful   magnifier of CDS in the wild.",1307,n,ER,,,

With parasite-parasite and predator-parasite links   omitted, measures of community complexity, such as connectance (C),   generally increased over multiple seasons.

Physiologists have long known that CO2 directly affects   acid-base and ion regulation, respiratory function and aerobic   performance in aquatic animals. More recently, many studies have   demonstrated that elevated CO2 projected for end of this century (e.g.   800-1000 mu atm) can also impact physiology, and have substantial   effects on behaviours linked to sensory stimuli (smell, hearing and   vision) both having negative implications for fitness and survival. In   contrast, the aquaculture industry was farming aquatic animals at CO2   levels that far exceed end-of-century climate change projections   (sometimes >10 000 mu atm) long before the term `ocean acidification'   was coined, with limited detrimental effects reported. It is therefore   vital to understand the reasons behind this apparent discrepancy.   Potential explanations include 1) the use of `control' CO2 levels in   aquaculture studies that go beyond 2100 projections in an ocean   acidification context; 2) the relatively benign environment in   aquaculture (abundant food, disease protection, absence of predators)   compared to the wild; 3) aquaculture species having been chosen due to   their natural tolerance to the intensive conditions, including CO2   levels; or 4) the breeding of species within intensive aquaculture   having further selected traits that confer tolerance to elevated CO2. We   highlight this issue and outline the insights that climate change and   aquaculture science can offer for both marine and freshwater settings.   Integrating these two fields will stimulate discussion on the direction   of future cross-disciplinary research.

Identifying the source of emergent pathogens is critical for mitigating   the impacts of diseases, and understanding the cause of their recent   appearances. One ecosystem suffering outbreaks of disease in the past   decades is coral reefs, where pathogens such as the fungus Aspergillus   sydowii have caused catastrophic population declines in their hosts.   Aspergillosis is one of the best-characterized coral diseases, yet the   origin of this typically terrestrial fungus in marine systems remains   unknown. We examined the genetic structure of a global sample of A.   sydowii, including isolates from diseased corals, diseased humans, and   environmental sources. Twelve microsatellite markers reveal a pattern of   global panmixia among the fungal isolates. A single origin of the   pathogen into marine systems seems unlikely given the lack of isolation   by distance and lack of evidence for a recent bottleneck. A   neighbour-joining phylogeny shows that sea fan isolates are interspersed   with environmental isolates, suggesting there have been multiple   introductions from land into the ocean. Overall, our results underscore   that A. sydowii is a true opportunist, with a diversity of nonrelated   isolates able to cause disease in corals.

Soil fauna was   introduced in different combination into the minicontainers   (single-collembolan, single-nematode, mixed and a non-faunal control   treatment) and placed into the topsoil (0 - 5 cm) of an arable field.   Each treatment was replicated five times. After 2 and 4 weeks, soil   fauna was counted and DON content was detected in soil and straw.   Population density of A. saprophilus developed mostly when received   DON-contaminated wheat straw. Individual numbers of F. candida was   highest in the mixed, non-infected treatment after 4 weeks. DON   concentration in remaining straw of the contaminated minicontainers was   reduced in the single collembolan treatment and in the single nematode   treatment after 2 weeks.

After 4 weeks   DON concentration decreased throughout all treatments compared to the   initial concentration. In soil, a DON concentration was measured   throughout all treatments after 2 weeks, which was reduced significantly   after 4 weeks.

We integrate studies of a wide range of   communities living on the same plant genotypes to understand how the   ecological and evolutionary dynamics of one community may be constrained   or modulated by its underlying genetic connections to another community.   We use pre-existing data sets collected from Populus angustifolia   (narrowleaf cottonwood) growing in a common garden to test the   hypothesis that the composition of pairs of distinct communities (e.g.   endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, soil microbes) covary across   tree genotypes, such that individual plant genotypes that support a   unique composition of one community are more likely to support a unique   composition of another community. We then evaluate the hypotheses that   physical proximity, taxonomic similarity, time between sampling (time   attenuation), and interacting foundation species within communities   explain the strength of correlations. Three main results emerged. First,   Mantel tests between communities revealed moderate to strong   (=0.25-0.85) community-genetic correlations in almost half of the   comparisons; correlations among phyllosphere endophyte, pathogen and   arthropod communities were the most robust. Secondly, physical proximity   determined the strength of community-genetic correlations, supporting a   physical proximity hypothesis. Thirdly, consistent with the interacting   foundation species hypothesis, the most abundant species drove many of   the stronger correlations. Other hypotheses were not   supported.Synthesis. The field of community genetics demonstrates that   the structure of communities varies among plant genotypes; our results   add to this field by showing that disparate communities covary among   plant genotypes. Eco-evolutionary dynamics between plants and their   associated organisms may therefore be mediated by the shared connections   of different communities to plant genotype, indicating that the   organization of biodiversity in this system is genetically based and   non-neutral.",1313,n,ER,,,

Recently, ecologists have emphasized that plant diversity   effects on plant productivity increase with time; however, the   mechanisms responsible for delayed ecosystem responses to diversity   manipulations are poorly understood. The present paper briefly reviews   temporal changes in grassland biodiversity experiments and proposes   antagonistic and facilitative soil effects on plant performance as a   mechanistic explanation for increasing plant diversity effects on plant   productivity with time. We show that the mechanisms previously proposed   to be responsible for the increasing influence of plant diversity   effects with time rely in part or entirely on soil biota. Moreover, we   show that significant plant diversity effects on soil organisms increase   considerably with experimental duration and that the number of   respective long-term studies is extremely low. We posit that in the   long-term species-rich plant communities experience predominantly   facilitative net effects by soil biota promoting plant community growth,   such as decomposers, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth   promoting rhizobacteria, whereas species-poor plant communities are   subject to antagonistic net soil effects due to the accumulation of   pathogens, such as nematodes.

Usually, they benefit their plant hosts through increased   nutrients (especially phosphorus, P) supply, improved growth, stress   tolerance and fitness as compared to the non-mycorrhizal plants. In   exchange for the symbiotic benefits, plant supplies the fungal partner   with carbon (C), constituting symbiotic costs for the plant. Here we   tested the effect of four soil treatments, combining removal of   indigenous AMF communities and/or supplementation with mineral P to   restore plant P nutrition, on plant growth and C fluxes from plant to   soil as well as on mineral nutrition of a C-3 and a congeneric C-4 grass   species.

Our results indicate possible   incompatibility of symbiotic partners of different geographic origin   (European AMF and tropical/subtropical grasses from Africa/Asia),   leading to apparent parasitism of the plants by the AMF communities in   terms of both growth and nutritional responses. Most likely,   downregulation of the direct (root) P uptake pathway by the plants in   response to mycorrhiza formation over-compensated the symbiotic   (indirect) P acquisition via mycorrhizal hyphae.

In addition to global analyses, five regions were   evaluated where potato is an important crop: the Andean Highlands,   Indo-Gangetic Plain and Himalayan Highlands, Southeast Asian Highlands,   Ethiopian Highlands, and Lake Kivu Highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa. We   found that the average global risk of potato late blight increases   initially, when compared with historic climate data, and then declines   as planting dates shift to cooler seasons. Risk in the agro-ecosystems   analyzed, varied from a large increase in risk in the Lake Kivu   Highlands in Rwanda to decreases in the Southeast Asian Highlands of   Indonesia.",1318,n,ER,,,

While these effects on host nutrient use are   mediated by host physiology, they likely depend on characteristics of   the parasite and host diet quality. We examined this possibility by   measuring nutrient release rates of uninfected Daphnia and conspecifics   infected by two microparasites (the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa and the   microsporidium Hamiltosporidium tvaerminnensis) from daphnid hosts fed   food that varied in phosphorus content. We found that infection type and   diet affected host nutrient release rates, but the strength of these   effects varied among parasite treatments. To improve our understanding   of these effects, we examined whether two separate aspects of host   exploitation (parasite-induced reductions in host fecundity and parasite   load) could account for variation in Daphnia nutrient release,   ingestion, and elemental ratios caused by our infection and diet   treatments. Regardless of whether we compared individuals across   infection type or diet treatment, Daphnia fecundity described variation   in multiple aspects of host nutrient use better than infection, diet, or   spore load. Our results suggest that parasite-induced changes in host   nutrient use are both parasite and diet specific, and that host   fecundity could be a useful parameter for predicting the magnitude and   direction of these changes.",1319,yes,ER,yes,,

Recent empirical and theoretical work has   implicated infection by barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV),   a group of generalist pathogens of the Poaceae family (grasses), as a   necessary precursor to the invasion of over 9 million hectares of   California's perennial grasslands by exotic annual grasses. The   mechanism underlying this pathogen-mediated invasion hypothesis is   elevated vector fecundity on exotic annual grasses. While empirical   evidence supports this hypothesis, the links between aphid fecundity,   host identity, and host resource supply have not been thoroughly   assessed. We performed field and laboratory experiments to examine the   fecundity and preference responses of three of the most common aphid   vectors of B/CYDV, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), R. maidis (Fitch), and   Sitobion avenae (Fab.), to a combination of host life history (annual   and perennial), host provenance (native and exotic), and nutrient supply   (mineral N and P fertilization), controlling for host phylogenetic   lineage. Aphids consistently had higher fecundity on annual grasses than   perennials, regardless of host provenance, age, or nutrient   fertilization. In addition, aphids preferentially colonized annual hosts   when offered a choice among host species. Multi-generation studies have   found that nutrient addition affects both host quality and composition   in natural communities; our experimental results indicate that the   indirect effects of nutrient fertilization in determining host community   composition are of more importance than are the direct effects on host   quality to aphid population dynamics.   To summarize the applications of our results, we demonstrate that, in   contrast to the current focus on the qualitative differences between   invaders and natives, the impact of invasive exotic grasses is not due   to host provenance, per se, but arises because the annual invaders   differ qualitatively from the native species in interactions with shared   pathogen vectors. More generally, our work demonstrates the importance   of isolating whether the fate and impacts of an invader are, at their   root, due to the provenance of the invader, or due to other   characteristics that determine its functional uniqueness in the context   of the native community.",1320,n,ER,,,

Bacteria interact with fungi in diverse   ways, and endobacteria that reside inside fungal cells represent the   most intimate interaction. The most significant bacterial endosymbionts   that have been studied are associated with Mucoromycota and include two   main groups: Burkholderia-related and Mycoplasmarelated endobacteria   (MRE). Examples of Burkholderia-related endobacteria have been reported   in the three Mucoromycota subphyla. By contrast, MRE have only been   identified in Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina. This study aims to   understand whether MRE dwell in Mortierellomycotina and, if so, to   determine their impact on the fungal host. We carried out a large-scale   screening of 394 Mortierellomycotina strains and employed a combination   of microscopy, molecular phylogeny, next-generation sequencing and qPCR.   We detected MRE in 12 strains. These endosymbionts represent novel   bacterial phylotypes and show evidence of recombination. Their presence   in Mortierellomycotina demonstrates that MRE occur within fungi across   Mucoromycota and they may have lived in their common ancestor. We cured   the fungus of its endosymbionts with antibiotics and observed improved   biomass production in isogenic lines lacking MRE, demonstrating that   these endobacteria impose some fitness costs to their fungal host. Here   we provided the first functional insights into the lifestyle of MRE. Our   findings indicate that MRE may be antagonistic to their fungal hosts,   and adapted to a non-lethal parasitic lifestyle in the mycelium of   Mucoromycota. However, context-dependent adaptive benefits to their host   at minimal cost cannot not be excluded.

Using an RNA   sequencing approach, we observed a strong transcriptional response of   N.italica R11 towards the presence of D.pulchra. In particular, genes   involved in oxidative stress resistance, carbohydrate and central   metabolism were upregulated in the presence of the host, suggesting a   role for these functions in the opportunistic pathogenicity of N.italica   R11.

Thelytokous (asexual) wasps are   mostly found in anthropogenic habitats, where hosts tend to aggregate   and food is absent. Arrhenotokous (sexual) wasps are exclusively found   in natural habitats, where hosts are scattered and food is present. We   analysed (1) the quantity of energy stored during ontogeny, (2) the   tradeoff between reproduction and survival, by measuring egg load and   longevity and (3) the host patch exploitation behaviour of the wasps at   emergence. Arrhenotokous wasps emerged with more metabolic resources   than thelytokous ones, especially glycogen, a nutrient that could be   used for flying in search of hosts and/or food. Thelytokous wasps   allocated more energy than arrhenotokous wasps to egg production: this   would allow them to parasitize more hosts. The tradeoff between egg   production and longevity was not revealed within reproductive modes, but   when comparing them. At emergence, arrhenotokous wasps tended to exploit   host patches less thoroughly than thelytokous wasps, suggesting that by   leaving the host patch, they search for food.

We studied the community and food-web structure of trap-nesting   insects in restored meadows and at increasing distances within   intensively managed grassland at 13 sites in Switzerland to test if   declining species diversity correlates with declining interaction   diversity and changes in food-web structure.   2. We analysed 49 quantitative food webs consisting of a total of 1382   trophic interactions involving 39 host/prey insect species and 14   parasitoid/predator insect species. Species richness and abundance of   three functional groups, bees and wasps as the lower trophic level and   natural enemies as the higher trophic level, were significantly higher   in restored than in adjacent intensively managed meadows. Diversity and   abundance of specific trophic interactions also declined from restored   to intensively managed meadows.   3. The proportion of attacked brood cells and the mortality of bees and   wasps due to natural enemies were significantly higher in restored than   in intensively managed meadows. Bee abundance and the rate of attacked   brood cells of bees declined with increasing distance from restored   meadows. These findings indicate that interaction diversity declines   more rapidly than species diversity in our study system.   4. Quantitative measures of food-web structure (linkage density,   interaction diversity, interaction evenness and compartment diversity)   were higher in restored than in intensively managed meadows. This was   reflected in a higher mean number of host/prey species per consumer   species (degree of generalism) in restored than in intensively managed   meadows.   5. The higher insect species and interaction diversity was related to   higher plant species richness in restored than in intensively managed   meadows.

Our findings provide empirical evidence for the theoretical   prediction that decreasing species richness at lower trophic levels   should reduce species richness at higher trophic levels, and in addition   lead to even stronger reductions in interaction diversity at these   higher levels. Species at higher trophic levels may thus benefit   relatively more than species at lower trophic levels from habitat   restoration in the grassland ecosystems studied.

Herbivory has been well-studied in both terrestrial   and aquatic systems, and there is abundant information on feedbacks   between herbivores and plants, coevolution of plant and herbivore   defenses, mechanisms for mediating nutrient limitation, effects of   nutrient limitation on herbivore life history, and, more recently, the   origins of the herbivorous diet. Researchers have sufficiently defined   the ecological context and evolutionary origins of the herbivorous diet,   and these main areas of research have laid the groundwork for studying   herbivory as an adaptation. However, we have yet to synthesize this   information in a way that allows us to establish a framework of testable   adaptive hypotheses. To understand the adaptive significance of this   diet transition, we review the current literature and use evidence from   these works as support for five hypotheses on the evolution of herbivory   from carnivory: (1) intake efficiency-herbivores use part of their food   source as habitat, thus minimizing the energy/time spent searching for   food and avoiding predators; (2) suboptimal habitat-herbivory allows   organisms to invade and establish populations in habitats that have high   primary production but low abundance of animal prey; (3) heterotroph   facilitation-herbivory is adaptive because herbivores consume microbes   associated with producers; (4) lipid allocation-herbivory is adaptive   because producers are rich in fatty acids, which fuel reproduction and   storage; and (5) disease avoidance-herbivory minimizes   animal-facilitated disease transmission. Due to the extensive   literature, we have limited this review to discussing herbivory in   freshwater systems. To our knowledge, no prior work has compiled a   comprehensive list of conditions that favor an herbivorous diet in   nature.

We (1) tested the GRH by   determining the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) content of   parasitic trematodes and their intermediate host, the freshwater snail   Elimia livescens, and (2) used this framework to determine the trematode   effects on host nutrient excretion and metabolism.

Snail   gonadal tissues more closely resembled the elemental content of parasite   tissues, although P content was 13\% higher in the gonad than the   trematode tissues. Despite differences in elemental content, N and P   excretion rates of snails were not affected by the presence of   parasites.

The results   show that dense and temporally stable host populations are exploited by   denser and more stable parasite populations. For parasites with   multi-host cycles, density of the `source' host did not matter: only   density of the current host affected parasite density at a given life   stage. For contact-transmitted parasites, intensity of infection   decreased with increasing host density.

However, the dynamics that underlie the emergence of   disease outbreaks in marine ecosystems still lack the equivalent level   of description, conceptual understanding, and modeling context routinely   present in the terrestrial systems. Here, we propose a theoretical basis   for modeling the transmission of marine infectious diseases (MIDs)   developed from simple models of the spread of infectious disease. The   models represent the dynamics of a variety of host-pathogen systems   including those unique to marine systems where transmission of disease   is by contact with waterborne pathogens both directly and through   filter-feeding processes. Overall, the analysis of the epizootiological   models focused on the most relevant processes that interact to drive the   initiation and termination of epizootics. A priori, systems with   multi-step disease infections (e.g., infection-death-particle   release-filtration-transmission) reduced dependence on individual   parameters resulting in inherently slower transmissions rates. This is   demonstrably not the case; thus, these alternative transmission pathways   must also considerably increase the rates of processes involved in   transmission. Scavengers removing dead infected animals may inhibit   disease spread in both contact-based and waterborne pathogen-based   diseases. The capacity of highly infected animals, both alive and dead,   to release a substantial number of infective elements into the water   column, making them available to suspension feeders results in such   diseases being highly infective with a very small ``low-abundance   refuge''. In these systems, the body burden of pathogens and the   relative importance between the release and the removal rate of   pathogens in the host tissue or water column becomes paramount. Two   processes are of potential consequence inhibiting epizootics. First,   large water volumes above the benthic susceptible populations can   function as a sink for pathogens. Second, unlike contact-based disease   models in which an increase in the number of susceptible individuals in   the population increases the likelihood of transmission and epizootic   development, large populations of filter feeders can reduce this   likelihood through the overfiltration of infective particles.",1332,n,ER,,,

Despite several large fires   that burned across these landscapes during the study period,   retrospective ForCaMF analysis showed that fire and root disease had   approximately equal impacts on C storage. Relative to C accumulation   that would have occurred in their absence, fires from 1990 to 2011 were   estimated to reduce regionwide C storage by 215.3 +/- 19.1 g/m(2) C,   while disease in the same period was estimated to reduce storage by   211.4 +/- 59.9 g/m(2) C. Harvest (75.5 +/- 13.5 g/m(2) C) and bark   beetle activity (14.8 +/- 12.5 g/m(2) C) were less important. While   long-term disturbance processes such as root disease have generally been   ignored by tools informing management of forest C storage, the recent   history of several national forests suggests that such disturbances can   be just as important to the C cycle as more conspicuous events like   wildfires.",1334,yes,ER,yes,,

Recent   theory has proposed a resolution: that genetic liability to   schizophrenia has evolved as a secondary consequence of selection for   human cognitive traits. This hypothesis predicts that genes increasing   the risk of this disorder have been subject to positive selection in the   evolutionary history of humans and other primates. We evaluated this   prediction using tests for recent selective sweeps in human populations   and maximum-likelihood tests for selection during primate evolution.   Significant evidence for positive selection was evident using one or   both methods for 28 of 76 genes demonstrated to mediate liability to   schizophrenia, including DISCI, DTNBP1 and NRG1, which exhibit   especially strong and well-replicated functional and genetic links to   this disorder. Strong evidence of non-neutral, accelerated evolution was   found for DISCI, particularly for exon 2, the only coding region within   the schizophrenia-associated haplotype. Additionally, genes associated   with schizophrenia exhibited a statistically significant enrichment in   their signals of positive selection in HapMap and PAML analyses of   evolution along the human lineage, when compared with a control set of   genes involved in neuronal activities. The selective forces underlying   adaptive evolution of these genes remain largely unknown, but these   findings provide convergent evidence consistent with the hypothesis that   schizophrenia represents, in part, a maladaptive by-product of adaptive   changes during human evolution.",1335,n,ER,,,

Messinger, Annette Ostling",2013,Predator attack rate evolution in space: The role of ecology mediated by   complex emergent spatial structure and self-shading,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,55-63,55-63,10.1016/j.tpb.2013.08.003,"Predation interactions are an important element of ecological   communities. Population spatial structure has been shown to influence   predator evolution, resulting in the evolution of a reduced predator   attack rate; however, the evolutionary role of traits governing predator   and prey ecology is unknown. The evolutionary effect of spatial   structure on a predator's attack rate has primarily been explored   assuming a fixed metapopulation spatial structure, and understood in   terms of group selection. But endogenously generated, emergent spatial   structure is common in nature. Furthermore, the evolutionary influence   of ecological traits may be mediated through the spatial   self-structuring process. Drawing from theory on pathogens, the   evolutionary effect of emergent spatial structure can be understood in   terms of self-shading, where a voracious predator limits its long-term   invasion potential by reducing local prey availability. Here we   formalize the effects of self-shading for predators using spatial moment   equations. Then, through simulations, we show that in a spatial context   self-shading leads to relationships between predator prey ecology and   the predator's attack rate that are not expected in a non-spatial   context. Some relationships are analogous to relationships already shown   for host pathogen interactions, but others represent new trait   dimensions. Finally, since understanding the effects of ecology using   existing self-shading theory requires simplifications of the emergent   spatial structure that do not apply well here, we also develop metrics   describing the complex spatial structure of the predator and prey   populations to help us explain the evolutionary effect of predator and   prey ecology in the context of self-shading. The identification of these   metrics may provide a step towards expansion of the predictive domain of   self-shading theory to more complex spatial dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier   Inc.

It has been postulated that recent   introduction of the brown marmorated stinkbug (Halyomorpha halys (Stal))   represents an evolutionary trap for native parasitoids, as they accept   H. halys egg masses as a host but produce no viable progeny.   Interspecific interactions between European egg parasitoid, Trissolcus   cultratus (Mayr), and an Asian parasitoid, Trissolcus japonicus   (Ashmead), were assessed by providing egg masses to T. cultratus at   various time intervals following the initial parasitization by T.   japonicus. The suitability of the host for the parasitoid development   was re-assessed by providing T. cultratus with fresh and frozen egg   masses of various ages. The likelihood of T. cultratus being able to   attack previously parasitized egg masses was determined by assessing the   duration of egg mass guarding behavior by T. japonicus following   parasitization. The results of experiments examining the interspecific   interactions between a native European egg parasitoid, T. cultratus, and   an Asian parasitoid, T. japonicus (a candidate for the biological   control of H. halys), showed that the native species can act as   facultative hyperparasitoid of the exotic one. Although this is only   possible during certain stages of T. japonicus development, the presence   of the introduced parasitoid may reduce the impact of the evolutionary   trap for indigenous parasitoid species. There is a possibility that the   occurrence of facultative hyperparasitism between scelionid parasitoids   associated with stinkbugs is common. This resulting intraguild predation   could promote conservation and stabilization of natural communities by   impacting the diversity and population dynamics of native stinkbugs and   their parasitoids (e.g., by allowing native parasitoids to avoid wasting   reproductive effort on unsuitable hosts), or reduce success of   biological control programs (e.g., by reducing the population size of   the exotic parasitoids).",1337,n,ER,,,

Yet, whether seed-borne endophytes enhance the host plant's ability to   overcome colonisation barriers and to regenerate within invaded sites   remains poorly understood. We examined how symbiosis with asexual   endophytic fungi (Neotyphodium) affected establishment and seed loss to   predators in the invasive annual grass Lolium multiflorum (Italian   ryegrass) across contrasting successional plots. Italian ryegrass seeds   with high and low endophyte incidence were sown into three communities:   a 1-year-old fallow field, a 15-year-old grassland, and a 24-year-old   forest, which conformed to an old-field chronosequence in the eastern   Inland Pampa, Argentina. We found that endophyte infection consistently   increased host population recruitment and reproductive output. Endophyte   presence also enhanced aerial biomass production of ryegrass in a low   recruitment year but not in a high recruitment year, suggesting that   symbiotic effects on growth performance are density dependent. Endophyte   presence reduced seed removal by rodents, although differential   predation may not account for the increased success of infected grass   populations. Overall, there was no statistical evidence for an   endophyte-by-site interaction, indicating that the fungal endosymbiont   benefitted host establishment regardless of large differences in biotic   and abiotic environment among communities.

Soft white and hard   white classes of winter and spring wheat, spring barley (Hordeum vulgare   L.), yellow mustard (Brassica hirta Moench), and safflower (Carthamus   tinctorius L.) were grown in various rotation combinations. Annual   precipitation was less than the long-term average of 301 mm in 7 out of   8 years. Rhizoctonia bare patch disease caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia   solani AG-8 appeared in year 3 and continued through year 8 in all   no-till plots. All crops were susceptible to rhizoctonia, but bare patch   area in wheat was reduced, and grain yield increased, when wheat was   grown in rotation with barley every other year. Remnant downy brome   (Bromus tectorum L.) weed seeds remained dormant for 6 years and longer   to heavily infest recrop winter wheat. There were few quantifiable   changes in soil quality due to crop rotation, but soil organic carbon   (SOC) increased in the surface 0-5 cm depth with no-till during the 8   years to approach that found in undisturbed native soil. Annual no-till   crop rotations experienced lower average profitability and greater   income variability compared to WW-SF. Yellow mustard and safflower were   not economically viable.

Our results showed   that A. nepalensis cultivation significantly decreased the total P   concentration, suggesting the high remediation potential. Moreover, A.   nepalensis improved the levels of soil-available N and K and promoted   the growth of microorganisms, as suggested by the 1.45- and even   3.26-fold increase in microbial carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN),   respectively, after 10 years of remediation.

Within   heterogeneous landscapes generalist predators often thrive, causing   cascading effects on local biological communities, yet there are few   data to suggest how attributes of fragmentation influence local   population dynamics of these species. We monitored 25 raccoon (Procyon   lotor) populations from 2004 to 2009 in a fragmented agricultural   landscape to evaluate the influence of local and landscape habitat   attributes on spatial and temporal variation in demography. Our results   indicate that agricultural ecosystems support increased densities of   raccoons relative to many other rural landscapes, but that spatial and   temporal variation in demography exists that is driven by   non-agricultural habitat attributes rather than the availability of   crops. At the landscape scale, both density and population stability   were positively associated with the size and contiguity of forest   patches, while at the local scale density was positively correlated with   plant diversity and the density of tree cavities. In addition,   populations occupying forest patches with greater levels of plant   diversity and stable water resources exhibited less temporal variability   than populations with limited plant species complexity or water   availability. The proportion of populations comprised of females was   most strongly influenced by the availability of tree cavities and soft   mast. Despite the abundance of mesopredators in heterogeneous   landscapes, our results indicate that all patches do not contribute   equally to the regional abundance and persistence of these species.   Thus, a clear understanding of how landscape attributes contribute to   variation in demography is critical to the optimization of management   strategies.",1342,n,ER,,,

The objective of this study was to determine microbial   community shifts following major land use changes in order to improve   our understanding of land use impacts on microbial community composition   and functions.   Four agricultural land use patterns were selected for the study,   including old rice paddy fields (ORP), Magnolia nursery planting (MNP),   short-term vegetable (STV), and long-term vegetable (LTV) cultivation.   All four systems are located in the same region with same soil parent   material (alluvium), and the MNP, STV, and LTV systems had been   converted from ORP for 10, 3, and 30 years, respectively. Soil bacteria   and ammonia oxidizer community compositions were analyzed by 454   pyrosequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism,   respectively. Quantitative PCR was used to determine 16S rRNA and amoA   gene copy numbers.   The results showed that when land use was changed from rice paddy to   upland systems, the relative abundance of Chloroflexi increased whereas   Acidobacteria decreased significantly. While LTV induced significant   shifts of bacterial composition, MNP had the highest relative abundance   of genera GP1, GP2, and GP3, which were mainly related to the   development of soil acidity. The community composition of   ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) but not ammonia-oxidizing archaea was   strongly impacted by the agricultural land use patterns, with LTV   inducing the growth of a single super predominant AOB group. The land   use changes also induced significant shifts in the abundance of 16S rRNA   and bacterial amoA genes, but no significant differences in the   abundance of archaea amoA was detected among the four land use patterns.   Soil total phosphorous, available phosphorous, NO3 (-), and soil organic   carbon contents and pH were the main determinants in driving the   composition of both bacteria and AOB communities.   These results clearly show the significant impact of land use change on   soil microbial community composition and abundance and this will have   major implications on the microbial ecology and nutrient cycling in   these systems, some of which is unknown.

The feeding range of an individual is central to food web dynamics as   it determines the spatial scale of predator-prey interactions. However,   despite recognition of its importance as a driving force in population   dynamics, establishing feeding range is seldom done as detailed   information on trophic interactions is difficult to obtain.   2. Biological markers are useful to answer this challenge as long as   spatial heterogeneity in signal is present within the area investigated.   A spatially complex ecosystem, Lake St. Pierre (LSP), a fluvial lake of   the St Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada), offered a unique opportunity to   determine the feeding range of a secondary consumer, yellow perch (Perca   flavescens) using isotopic ratios of carbon (delta C-13). However,   because food chains based on phytoplankton have generally more negative   delta C-13 than those depending on periphyton, it was essential to   determine the contribution of zooplankton in fish diet to correctly   interpret spatial patterns of delta C-13. We used parasites in perch to   examine whether their delta C-13 was reflecting local delta C-13   baseline conditions rather than a feeding specialization on zooplankton.   3. delta C-13 of primary consumers was highly variable and exhibited a   striking gradient along the shore-channel axis, suggesting that delta   C-13 should reflect an individual consumer's spatial position in LSP.   4. This strong isotopic gradient allowed us to estimate the spatial   scale of the resources used by individual perch following an approach   presented by Rasmussen, Trudeau \& Morinville (Journal of Animal   Ecology, 78, 2009, 674). By comparing the delta C-13 variability in   perch to that of primary consumers, we estimated that the adults feeding   range was around 2 km along the shore-channel axis.   5.

The resilience literature often assumes that social-ecological   reorganization will result in either the removal of deficient system   elements (components, interactions) or social learning. Major   perturbations are expected to lead to either adaptation or, if   accompanied by a regime shift, transformation. This has led to a   conflation of the concepts of resilience and adaptation, which has in   turn made it difficult to quantitatively distinguish between cases in   which a system returned to a previous state, and adaptation or learning   occurred, and cases in which the system was resilient but adaptation or   learning did not occur.   2. We used a network analysis of nine years of ostrich movement data to   explore the socialecological resilience of the Western Cape ostrich   industry, which nearly collapsed following an outbreak of highly   pathogenic avian influenza in 2011 and has gradually rebuilt.   3. The system that emerged following the outbreak contained fewer farms   but was more connected than at any period prior to the outbreak. As   system reorganization proceeded, network traits began to fluctuate   seasonally and to approach values similar to those observed prior to the   outbreak. It was estimated that it would take 4-5 full seasonal cycles   for the system to return to a similar state to that prior to the disease   outbreak. In other words, although the system reorganized following the   system collapse, it remained within the same regime and showed no   obvious evidence of adaptation or learning.   4. Policy implications. The majority of previous work on studying system   response to disturbance has focused on outcome-based adaptation and   learning. This study highlights the need to understand systems that   respond to disturbance without learning or adaptation. Network analysis   offers a useful quantitative tool for exploring social-ecological   resilience and tracking changes in vulnerability. However, the   development of better ways of incorporating additional data from   multiple scales into network analysis remains an important priority for   improving the predictive power and policy relevance of network   approaches to analysing resilience.",1345,n,ER,,,

In common with tropical   forests across most of the world, tropical forests in Oceania are   declining due to factors associated with increasing human population   size, economic drivers and more intensive exploitation. In parts of   Oceania, forests are being cleared at unsustainable rates, and replaced   with far simpler ecosystems of timber or food crops. To a small degree,   the present-day biodiversity of tropical forests in some parts of   Oceania may be predisposed to such disturbance, given a history of   natural disturbance (particularly through cyclones), and of   smaller-scale slash-and-burn agriculture or landscape-scale burning.   But, in most places, the current intensity, scale and/or rate of   modification far surpass their precedents, and biodiversity is   consequently diminishing. Tropical forests in Australia may be an   exception to this trend, with now reasonably effective protection.   However, more so than for tropical forests in most other continents, the   major biodiversity conservation challenges for tropical forests in   Oceania are extrinsic. Introduced plants, animals and diseases have   collapsed ecological communities through much of Oceania, homogenising   the biota from a series of highly distinctive and localised species   assemblages to a more impoverished set of ubiquitous   disturbance-tolerant exotic species. In many islands, this   simplification has occurred regardless of the extent of native forest   remaining, such that retention and reservation of primary forest is an   insufficient conservation action. The fate of biodiversity in Oceania is   also likely to be much affected by climate change, an unbalanced   consequence given the region's relatively small contribution to   greenhouse gas emissions. Future hope for biodiversity conservation in   tropical forests of Oceania lies in the renewed application of some   traditional management constraints, the appropriate delivery of   international support (such as may be available through carbon markets),   improved quarantine processes, and through some protection naturally   offered by the remote scattering of the islands that comprise Oceania.

This variation, coupled with that of the host plant and   environment, may alter abundances, diversity, and trophic structure of   associated plant and animal communities. Fungal endophytes in the genus   Neotyphodium are vertically transmitted, asexual microbial symbionts of   grasses that remain asymptomatic and rely upon their hosts for resources   and transmission via seeds, often providing benefits to their hosts,   including protection against herbivores. Endophyte infections may   influence associated arthropod communities in agronomic grasses, but the   long-term effects of endophytes and variation in host genotype and   resource availability on arthropod communities in native grass   populations are unknown. We conducted a long-term field experiment with   four maternal genotypes of an infected (E+) native grass (Festuca   arizonica) from whence the endophyte was experimentally removed (E-) and   water availability was controlled, to test the effects of infection,   plant genotype, and resources on abundances, biomass, diversity   (richness and evenness), and trophic structure of the arthropod   community. Generally, E+ grasses harbored more arthropods, including   more herbivores, predators, and detritivores, suggesting that the   effects of endophytes cascaded upward through trophic levels in terms of   abundances, at least in early ontogeny of the host. That E+ plants   harbored more herbivorous insects than E- plants suggests that infection   does not increase but instead decreases resistance to herbivores,   contrary to prevailing concepts of endophytes as defensive mutualists.   Infection did not alter overall species richness of the arthropod   community or richness of herbivores but reduced natural enemy richness,   especially that of parasites, and increased richness of detritivores.   Reduced richness and shifts in evenness of natural enemies on E+ plants   suggest that endophytes may disproportionately affect diversity at   higher trophic levels and may partially explain increases in abundances   of herbivorous insects on E+ plants. Biomass of predators, detritivores,   and omnivores increased on plants with supplemented water, and arthropod   and herbivore biomass varied by plant genotype. Symbiont-mediated   phenotypic variation interacts with variation from plant genotype and   environmental factors to alter arthropod abundances and diversity, and   these effects shift with ontogeny of the host.",1348,n,ER,,,

Three years after mistletoe removal, treatment woodlands lost, on   average, 20.9 per cent of their total species richness, 26.5 per cent of   woodland-dependent bird species and 34.8 per cent of their   woodland-dependent residents, compared with moderate increases in   control sites and no significant changes in mistletoe-free sites.   Treatment sites lost greater proportions of birds recorded nesting in   mistletoe, but changes in species recorded feeding on mistletoe did not   differ from control sites. Having confirmed the status of mistletoe as a   keystone resource, we suggest that nutrient enrichment via litter-fall   is the main mechanism promoting species richness, driving small-scale   heterogeneity in productivity and food availability for woodland   animals. This explanation applies to other parasitic plants with high   turnover of enriched leaves, and the community-scale influence of these   plants is most apparent in low productivity systems.",1349,maybe,ER,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,

Dymond, Linda Newstrom",2018,Mapping floral resources for honey bees in New Zealand at the catchment   scale,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,1182-1196,1182-1196,10.1002/eap.1717,"Honey bees require nectar and pollen from flowers: nectar for energy and   pollen for growth. The demand for nectar and pollen varies during the   year, with more pollen needed in spring for colony population growth and   more nectar needed in summer to sustain the maximum colony size and   collect surplus nectar stores for winter. Sufficient bee forage is   therefore necessary to ensure a healthy bee colony. Land-use changes can   reduce the availability of floral resources suitable for bees, thereby   increasing the susceptibility of bees to other stressors such as disease   and pesticides. In contrast, land-based management decisions to protect   or plant bee forage can enhance pollen and nectar supply to bees while   meeting other goals such as riparian planting for water-quality   improvement. Commercial demand for honey can also put pressure on floral   resources through over-crowding of hives. To help understand and manage   floral resources for bees, we developed a spatial model for mapping   monthly nectar and pollen production from maps of land cover. Based on   monthly estimated production data we mapped potential monthly supply of   nectar and pollen to a given apiary location in the landscape. This is   done by summing the total production within the foraging range of the   apiary while subtracting the estimated nectar converted to energy for   collection. Ratios of estimated supply over theoretical hive demand may   then be used to infer a potential landscape carrying capacity to sustain   hives. This model framework is quantitative and spatial, utilizing   estimated flight energy costs for nectar foraging. It can contribute to   management decisions such as where apiaries could be placed in the   landscape depending on floral resources and where nectar limited areas   may be located. It can contribute to planning areas for bee protection   or planting such as in riparian vegetation. This would aid managed bee   health, wild pollinator protection, and honey production. We demonstrate   the methods in a case study in New Zealand where there is a growing   demand for mnuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey production.",1350,n,ER,,,

Tradeoffs between disease risk and foraging drive animal   activity around raccoon latrines,OIKOS,927-934,927-934,10.1111/oik.04866,"Fear of predation alters prey behavior, which can indirectly alter   entire landscapes. A parasite-induced ecology of fear might also exist   if animals avoid parasite-contaminated resources when infection costs   outweigh foraging benefits. To investigate whether animals avoid   parasite contaminated sites, and if such avoidance balances disease   costs and foraging gains, we monitored animal behavior at raccoon   latrines - sites that concentrate both seeds and pathogenic parasite   eggs. Using wildlife cameras, we documented over 40 potentially   susceptible vertebrate species in latrines and adjacent habitat. Latrine   contact rates reflected background activity, diet preferences and   disease risk. Disease-tolerant raccoons and rats displayed significant   site attraction, while susceptible birds and small mammals avoided these   high-risk sites. This suggests that parasites, like predators, might   create a landscape of fear for vulnerable hosts. Such non-consumptive   parasite effects could alter disease transmission, population dynamics,   and even ecosystem structure.",1351,n,ER,,,

In primary successional systems,   belowground organisms are known to have particularly important control   over plant growth. Exotic plant invasions in these and other habitats   may in part be explained by altered associations with belowground   organisms compared to native plants. We investigated the growth   responses of two foundation grasses on Great Lakes sand dunes, the   native grass Ammophila breviligulata and the exotic grass Leymus   arenarius, to two groups of soil organisms with important roles in dune   succession: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant-parasitic   nematodes (PPN). We manipulated the presence/absence of two generalist   belowground species known to occur in Great Lakes dunes, Rhizophagus   intraradices (AMF) and Pratylenchus penetrans (PPN) in a factorial   greenhouse experiment and assessed the biomass production and root   architectural traits of the plants. There were clear differences in   growth and above-and belowground architecture between Ammophila and   Leymus, with Leymus plants being bigger, taller, and having longer roots   than Ammophila. Inoculation with Rhizophagus increased above-and   belowground biomass production by similar to 32\% for both plant   species. Inoculation with Pratylenchus decreased aboveground biomass   production by similar to 36\% for both plant species. However   belowground, the exotic Leymus was significantly more resistant to PPN   than the native Ammophila, and gained more benefits from AMF in   belowground tritrophic interactions than Ammophila. Overall, our results   indicate that differences in plant architecture coupled with altered   belowground interactions with AMF and PPN have the potential to promote   exotic plant invasion.",1352,yes,ER,yes,,

It   produces high amounts of sewage sludge that can be managed and perceived   in two main ways: as a waste it is discharged in landfill, as a   fertilizer it is disposed in agriculture with direct application to soil   or subjected to anaerobic digestion and composting. Other solutions,   such as incineration or production of concrete, bricks and asphalt play   a secondary role in terms of their degree of diffusion. The agronomical   value of domestic sewage sludge is a proved question, which may be   hidden by the presence of several pollutants such as heavy metals,   organic compounds and pathogens. In this way, the sustainability of   sewage sludge agricultural disposal requires a value judgment based on   knowledge and evaluation of the level of pollution of both sewage sludge   and soil. The article analyzed a typical Italian case study, a water   management system of small communities, applying the criteria of   evaluation of the last official document of European Union about sewage   sludge land application, the ``Working Document on Sludge (3rd draft,   2000)''. The report brought out good sewage sludge from small   wastewater treatment plants and soils quality suggesting a sustainable   application.",1353,n,ER,,,

The T4-like cyanomyoviruses are abundant in   the marine environment and have broad host-ranges relative to other   cyanophages. It is currently unknown whether broad host-range phages   specifically tailor their infection program for each host, or employ the   same program irrespective of the host infected. Also unknown is how   different hosts respond to infection by the same phage. Here we used   microarray and RNA-seq analyses to investigate the interaction between   the Syn9 T4-like cyanophage and three phylogenetically, ecologically and   genomically distinct marine Synechococcus strains: WH7803, WH8102 and   WH8109. Strikingly, Syn9 led a nearly identical infection and   transcriptional program in all three hosts. Different to previous   assumptions for T4-like cyanophages, three temporally regulated gene   expression classes were observed. Furthermore, a novel regulatory   element controlled early-gene transcription, and host-like promoters   drove middle gene transcription, different to the regulatory paradigm   for T4. Similar results were found for the P-TIM40 phage during   infection of Prochlorococcus NATL2A. Moreover, genomic and metagenomic   analyses indicate that these regulatory elements are abundant and   conserved among T4-like cyanophages. In contrast to the near-identical   transcriptional program employed by Syn9, host responses to infection   involved host-specific genes primarily located in hypervariable genomic   islands, substantiating islands as a major axis of phage-cyanobacteria   interactions. Our findings suggest that the ability of broad host-range   phages to infect multiple hosts is more likely dependent on the   effectiveness of host defense strategies than on differential tailoring   of the infection process by the phage.",1354,n,ER,,,

Hundreds of   aromatic plant species, which contain essential oils, are growing   naturally around the Mediterranean. The plant essential oils are known   for their antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to   investigate whether the aromatic Laurus nobilis, abundant in the   Mediterranean region, can influence the development of two mycorrhizal   species, Glomus deserticola and Glomus intraradices, and how this effect   can influence the growth of the host plant. The major compounds of L.   nobilis essential oil were 1,8 cineole, sabinene, alpha-pinene,   eugenole, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and beta-pinene. Both mycorrhizal   fungi colonized successfully the host plants, positively influencing   their growth. G. deserticola presented higher infection level than G.   intraradices. Addition of L. nobilis oil into substrates resulted in   mycorrhiza inhibition, and the level of inhibition was analogous with   the amount of added essential oil. The fungi were benefited by the   aromatic compounds up to 15 mg of essential oil per L of soil. However,   30 and 60 mg L(-1) of essential oil were able to create significant   inhibition in mycorrhiza development and to restrict the host growth.   Since the presence of aromatics in the Mediterranean region could create   such ecological problems, the elimination of aromatic plant litter   before reforestation is suggested, to give the opportunity for   mycorrhiza establishment and successful development of new plants.",1355,n,ER,,,

Although cuterebrid bot flies   are among the physically largest and most-studied insect parasites of   mammals, the only study conducted on metabolic consequences of bot fly   parasitism revealed a surprisingly small effect of bot flies on host   metabolism. Here we test the prediction that bot fly parasitism   increases the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of free-ranging eastern   chipmunks (Tamias striatus), particularly in juveniles who have not   previously encountered parasites and have to allocate energy to growth.   We found no effect of bot fly parasitism on adults. In juveniles,   however, we found that RMR strongly increased with the number of bot fly   larvae hosted. For a subset of 12 juveniles during a year where parasite   prevalence was particularly high, we also compared the RMR before versus   during the peak of bot fly prevalence, allowing each individual to act   as its own control. Each bot fly larva resulted in a similar to 7.6\%   increase in the RMR of its host while reducing juvenile growth rates.   Finally, bot fly parasitism at the juvenile stage was positively   correlated with adult stage RMR, suggesting persistent effects of bot   flies on RMR. This study is the first to show an important effect of bot   fly parasitism on the metabolism and growth of a wild mammal. Our work   highlights the importance of studying cost of parasitism over multiple   years in natural settings, as negative effects on hosts are more likely   to emerge in periods of high energetic demand (e.g. growing juveniles)   and/or in harsh environmental conditions (e.g. low food availability).",1356,n,ER,,,

However, despite their   crucial role in ecosystem functioning, our understanding of the   distribution of below-ground fungi is still limited, calling for more   comprehensive studies of fungal biogeography along environmental   gradients at various scales (from regional to global). Here, we   investigated the richness of taxa of soil fungi and their phylogenetic   diversity across a wide range of grassland types along a 2800 m   elevation gradient at a large number of sites (213), stratified across a   region of the Western Swiss Alps (700 km(2)). We used 454 pyrosequencing   to obtain fungal sequences that were clustered into operational   taxonomic units (OTUs). The OTU diversity-area relationship revealed   uneven distribution of fungal taxa across the study area (i.e. not all   taxa are everywhere) and fine-scale spatial clustering. Fungal richness   and phylogenetic diversity were found to be higher in lower temperatures   and higher moisture conditions. Climatic and soil characteristics as   well as plant community composition were related to OTU alpha, beta and   phylogenetic diversity, with distinct fungal lineages suggesting   distinct ecological tolerances.
