While the   vulnerability of these relationships to environmental change is a major   concern, studies often lack a framework for predicting impacts from   emerging threats (e.g. biological invasions). The objective of this   study was to determine the reliance of Platanthera ciliaris   (orange-fringed orchid) on Papilio palamedes (Palamedes swallowtail   butterfly) for pollination and the relative availability of alternative   pollinators. Recent declines of P. palamedes larval host plants due to   laurel wilt disease (LWD) could endanger P. ciliaris populations that   rely heavily on this butterfly for pollination. We monitored pollinator   visitation and fruit set and measured nectar spur lengths of P. ciliaris   flowers and proboscis lengths of its floral visitors in Jackson County,   MS, USA. Papilio palamedes was the primary visitor with minimal   visitation by Phoebis sennae (cloudless sulfur butterfly). Lengths of P.   ciliaris nectar spurs were similar to proboscis lengths of both   pollinator species. Fruit set was moderate with access to pollinators   (55 +/- 10.8 \%), yet failed (0 \%) when pollinators were excluded.   Visitation increased with inflorescence size, but there was no such   pattern in fruit set, indicating that fruit set was not limited by   pollinator visitation within the range of visitation rates we observed.   Our results are supported by historical data that suggest P. palamedes   and P. sennae are important pollinators of P. ciliaris. Although P.   sennae may provide supplemental pollination service, this is likely   constrained by habitat preferences that do not always overlap with those   of P. cilaris. Observed declines of P. palamedes due to LWD could   severely limit the reproductive success and persistence of P. ciliaris   and similar orchid species populations. This empirical-based prediction   is among the first to document exotic forest pests and pathogens as an   indirect threat to plant-pollinator interactions.",273,NA,TH,NO,no data on PP,,no data on PP

The   importance of infectious diseases has been documented in honeybees, but   there is little information on the extent to which these diseases are   shared with other pollinator orders. Here, we establish for the first   time the presence of three important bee viruses in hoverfly pollinators   (Diptera: Syrphidae): black queen cell virus (BQCV), sacbrood virus   (SBV) and deformed wing virus strain B (DWV-B). These viruses were   detected in two Eristalis species, which are behavioural and   morphological bee mimics and share a foraging niche with honeybees.   Nucleotide sequences of viruses isolated from the Eristalis species and   Apis mellifera were up to 99 and 100\% identical for the two viruses,   suggesting that these pathogens are being shared freely between bees and   hoverflies. Interestingly, while replicative intermediates (negative   strand virus) were not detected in the hoverflies, viral titres of SBV   were similar to those found in A. mellifera. These results suggest that   syrphid pollinators may play an important but previously unexplored role   in pollinator disease dynamics.",274,NA,TH,NO,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,,no data on PP impacts

However, fungicide use might have negative   impacts on soil-faunal mediated nutrient cycling, a crucial process in   perennial systems in the tropics as fertilizer is rarely used. An   experiment was established in 35 year old cacao farms in southern   Cameroon to assess the effects of different fungicide application rates,   none, reduced ('low'), and manufacturer's recommended rate ('high'),   upon earthworm cast production for 4 years and this was also compared   with cast production in a secondary forest of the same age.   Supplementary measurements were made to assess the impacts of fungicide   treatment on litter decomposition and, through potentially lower   earthworm activity, on soil compaction. Cocoa yields were 2.5 times   greater in the high spray treatment than in the low spray treatment.   There were no significant differences in cast production between cacao   spray treatments in the first 3 years. In year 4 only, cast production   was significantly lower in the high spray treatment than in the no-spray   control. With no evidence of any negative effect on either litter   decomposition or soil bulk density, the high spray regime can be   recommended to farmers, perhaps accompanied by measures such as adding   leguminous cover crops or mulch to hasten litter decomposition rates,   provide soil coverage and thus possibly reducing the efficacy of P.   megakarya inoculum.

Few pathogens are the sole or primary cause of species extinctions,   but forest disease has caused spectacular declines in North American   overstorey trees and restructured forest ecosystems at large spatial   scales over the past 100 years. These events threaten biodiversity   associated with impacted host trees and other resources valued by human   societies even when they do not directly cause host extinction.   2. Invasion of Phytophthora ramorum and emergence of the forest disease   sudden oak death has caused a large-scale decline of tanoak   (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) in Californian coastal forests. Here, we   describe structural changes to tanoak forests and develop predictive   models of infection rates, mortality rates and changes in tanoak biomass   and abundance by combining regionally extensive longitudinal field   studies and mathematical modelling.   3. Pathogen-invaded stands had smaller average tanoak tree size and   higher proportions of large dead tanoak trees compared with uninvaded   stands. This pattern is caused in part by a positive relationship   between tanoak size and mortality rate, as well as prolific basal   sprouting from trees killed by the disease. Tanoak infection, mortality   and biomass decline rates were positively related to the prevalence of   infection in sporulation-supporting species, especially California bay   laurel (Umbellularia californica).   4. We developed a stage-structured and spatially explicit mathematical   model including species dynamics and P. ramorum transmission, where the   long-term outcome of disease ranges from host extinction when densities   of bay laurel are high to limited or no disease outbreak. Low densities   of tanoak in a matrix of non-susceptible neighbouring species resulted   in slow-enough transmission to retain overstorey tanoak, suggesting   host-density thresholds may exist in real forests.   5. Synthesis. Tanoak is likely to persist in many disease-impacted   forests via vegetative reproduction, but overstorey trees may be   eliminated or greatly reduced in abundance, a pattern similar to other   forest diseases that have emerged in the last century including chestnut   blight and beech bark disease. Our results support a general model of   disease-caused changes to forest trees useful for the analysis of   emerging forest pathogens where vegetative reproduction, community-level   epidemiology and stage-specific mortality rate interact to determine   local disease intensity and host decline.",304,NA,TH,yes,,size distribution in invaded vs. uninvaded is effect of PP on mortality across age classes,

Viruses have become widely recognized as the most abundant biological   entities and important players in aquatic environments, and this   realization has profoundly changed our conceptual understanding of the   functioning and regulation of aquatic ecosystems in the last two   decades. However, most of this research has focussed on marine viruses,   especially in pelagic environments.   2. Here we introduce a special issue of Freshwater Biology dealing with   viruses in freshwater ecosystems. It represents the first attempt to   summarize progress in freshwater viral ecology made by diverse research   groups and to direct attention of viral ecologists towards fresh waters.   3. Six review-type articles and ten original research papers cover a   wide range of aspects of freshwater viral ecology. This includes reports   on the distribution of freshwater viral communities in contrasting   habitats (e.g. sediments, wetlands, littoral zone, open waters), on   different roles of viruses in freshwater ecosystems (e.g. mortality   rates of bacteria and phytoplankton, transduction, influence on   bacterial diversity and organic matter), and on different types of   viruses (bacteriophages, cyanophages, algal viruses, and a   fish-pathogenic virus).   4. Collectively the series of papers presented in this special issue   indicates that freshwater environments cover great habitat diversity and   that the significance of some of the mechanisms controlling viral   dynamics and impacts may differ between freshwater and marine habitats.",310,NA,TH,NO,review,,review

Disease may   accelerate tree species' declines in response to global change factors,   such as drought, biotic interactions, such as competition, or functional   traits, such as allometry. To assess the role of disease in mediating   mortality risk in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), we developed   hierarchical Bayesian models for both disease prevalence in live aspen   stems and the resulting survival rates of healthy and diseased aspen   near the species' southern range limit using 5088 individual trees on   281 United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plots in   the southwestern United States. We found that disease prevalence   depended primarily on tree size, tree allometry, and spatial variation   in precipitation, while mortality depended on tree size, allometry,   competition, spatial variation in summer temperature, and both temporal   and spatial variation in summer precipitation. Disease prevalence was   highest in large trees with low slenderness found on dry sites. For   healthy trees, mortality decreased with diameter, slenderness, and   temporal variation in summer precipitation, but increased with   competition and spatial variation in summer temperature. Mortality of   diseased trees decreased with diameter and aspen relative basal area and   increased with mean summer temperature and precipitation. Disease   infection increased aspen mortality, especially in trees of intermediate   size and trees on plots at climatic extremes (i.e., cool, wet and warm,   dry climates). By examining variation in disease prevalence, mortality   of healthy trees, and mortality of diseased trees, we showed that the   role of disease in aspen tree mortality depended on the scale of   inference. For variation among individuals in diameter, disease tended   to expose intermediate-size trees experiencing moderate risk to greater   risk. For spatial variation in summer temperature, disease exposed lower   risk populations to greater mortality probabilities, but the magnitude   of this exposure depended on summer precipitation. Furthermore, the   importance of diameter and slenderness in mediating responses to climate   supports the increasing emphasis on trait variation in studies of   ecological responses to global change.",313,NA,TH,no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,,no information on ecosystem effects

Introduced pests and pathogens are a major source of disturbance to   ecosystems world-wide. The famous examples have produced dramatic   reductions in host abundance, including virtual extirpation, but most   introductions have more subtle impacts that are hard to quantify but are   potentially at least as important due to the pathogens' effects on host   reproduction, competitive ability and stress tolerance. A general   outcome could be reduced host abundance with concomitant increases in   the abundance of competitors.   2. Beech bark disease (BBD) is a widespread, fatal affliction of   American beech (Fagus grandifolia), currently present in c. 50\% of   beech's distribution in eastern North America. Despite high adult   mortality, beech remains a dominant component of the forest community.   3. Employing spatially extensive data from the national Forest Inventory   and Analysis program of the United States Forest Service, we show that   forests have changed dramatically in the presence of BBD. Within the 2.3   million km(2) range of beech, size-specific mortality was 65\% higher in   the longest-infected regions, and large beech (>90 cm diameter at breast   height) have declined from c. 79 individuals km(-2) to being virtually   absent. Small stem beech density was dramatically higher (>350\%) such   that infested forests contain a roughly equivalent cross-sectional   (basal) area of beech as before BBD.   4. There was no evidence for compensation by sugar maple or other   co-occurring tree species via increased recruitment or adult   survivorship at the landscape scale. Overall, community composition   remained roughly unchanged as a result of BBD.   5. Surprisingly, trajectory of stand dynamics (shifts in stem density   and mean tree size reflecting normal stand maturation (self-thinning) or   retrogression (more abundant, smaller trees over time)) did not differ   between affected and unaffected regions. Variance in stand dynamics was   greater in afflicted forests, however, indicating that predictability of   forest structure has been diminished by BBD.   6. Synthesis. Forests of eastern North America have shifted to increased   density and dramatically smaller stature without notable change in tree   species composition following the invasion of a novel forest disease.   Our results reinforce the conclusion that introduced diseases alter   fundamental properties of ecosystems, but indicate that the spectrum of   potential effects is broader than generally appreciated.",315,NA,TH,yes,,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,"no information on ecosystem effects (host abundance, mortality, not basal area); small stem density"

AMF are keystone organisms   that form an interface between soils and plant roots, and are sensitive   to changes in soil and plant conditions. They are important microbial   symbioses for plants and under conditions of P-limitation and are   significant in the maintenance of soil health and fertility. AMF are   crucial for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and plants form   symbiotic interactions with AMF and colonize more than 80\% of plant   roots. Mycorrhizal fungi are known to influence plant diversity patterns   in a variety of ecosystems globally. AMF hyphae form an extensive   network in soil and length is a common parameter used to quantifying   fungal hyphae. The mycelial network of AM fungi extends into the soil   volume and greatly increases the surface area for uptake of immobile   nutrients. Also, AM symbioses improve drought tolerance of plants and   enhance tolerance of or resistance to root pathogens. Furthermore,   networks of AM hyphae play a role in the formation of stable soil   aggregates, building up a macroporous structure of soil that allows   penetration of water and air and prevents erosion. The functioning of   AMF symbiosis is mediated by direct and indirect effects of biotic and   abiotic factors of the surrounding rhizosphere, community, and   ecosystem. They have great potential in the restoration of disturbed   land and low fertility soil. Little is known about the effects of   environmental changes on AMF abundance, activity and the impact on   ecosystem services. Also, we still have much to learn regarding the   extent of mycorrhizal fungal diversity. It is critical to gain a clearer   understanding of functional variation among AM fungal species to guide   conservation and restoration efforts.",325,NA,TH,NO,no data on PP,,no data on PP (AMF)

It has been extensively reported that   Amoebophrya parasitoids occur in temperate coastal areas of the northern   hemisphere; however, little is known about their distribution and   importance in tropical areas and southern oceans. We used an rRNA-based,   fluorescent in situ hybridization assay to detect Amoebophrya spp.   infections during the decline of a late-summer dinoflagellate population   dominated by Ceratium falcatiforme in a tropical coastal area of the   southern Atlantic Ocean subjected to recurrent upwelling-downwelling   cycles. Conditions during our survey were typical of downwelling when   oligotrophic waters dominate the area. C. falcatiforme was the most   infected host, with a prevalence averaging 2\% over the study area at   the beginning of sampling. At a fixed sampling station monitored over 4   wk, Amoebophrya prevalence escalated from 1 to 7\% over a 6 d period,   concomitant to a 94\% decrease in host cell numbers. Infection by   Amoebophrya was estimated to have killed ca. 11\% of the host cell   population within this period; thus, parasitism was not the main factor   behind the C. falcatiforme population decline. Estimates based on   biovolume calculations indicate that ca. 6.5\% of the carbon in the   decaying C. falcatiforme population was transformed into parasitoid   dinospores, which became available to tintinnid ciliates that were   abundant during our survey. Such a trophic link might be relevant in   tropical oligotrophic waters when the system is characterized by a   microbial food web structure.",328,NA,TH,YES,,,

These plant communities evolved   as a result of a long history of human activity, which generated and   maintained these habitats by extensive grazing and mowing. Calcareous   grasslands are listed as a priority for conservation in the EC Habitats   Directive. However, the effects of different management regimes,   nitrogen enrichment, and soil-borne pathogens on plant species diversity   are less clear for grasslands of the Mediterranean Basin, compared to   meadows in Northern and Central Europe. In this study, we assessed the   impact of land abandonment, nitrogen enrichment, and fairy-ring fungi on   species diversity in semi-natural grasslands found in the Mediterranean   Basin by comparing the available literature with findings from recent   studies carried out in Central Italy. In a series of field experiments,   the cutting of abandoned grassland consistently reduced the living   biomass of the dominant perennial grasses, such as Brachypodium rupestre   and Bromus erectus, and promoted a rapid increase in species richness   and diversity by allowing the establishment of rare species. There was a   similar, but less effective, restoration of species diversity and   composition in mowed grassland after litter removal. We also show that   nitrogen enrichment at levels comparable to atmospheric deposition   depresses species diversity, which also hampers the positive effects of   litter removal. Our findings are consistent with previous results   achieved in Northern and Central Europe, which however, mainly focused   on grasslands with intermediate to high primary productivity levels. The   limited availability of data from low-productivity, drought-prone   Mediterranean grasslands requires further studies to assess the impact   of land abandonment and nitrogen eutrophication in such ecosystems.   Finally, we discuss the role of fairy-ring fungi in the maintenance of   plant diversity in species-rich grassland. We show that fairy-ring fungi   (e.g. Agaricus campestris) critically affect the spatial distribution   and diversity of coexisting plant species. By killing the dominant   perennial herbs, these radially growing plant pathogens produce empty   niches for rare, short-lived species, thus affecting the vegetation   pattern.

Importantly, we excluded foliar fungal pathogens along with   rabbits, insects, and mollusks in a full factorial design, which allowed   a comparison of pathogen effects along with those of better studied   plant enemies.

The CLIMEX model   captured areas of climatic suitability where P. cinnamomi occurs that is   congruent with all available records. The model was validated by the   collection of soil samples from asymptomatic vegetation in areas   projected to be suitable by the model for which there were few records.

We investigated the population dynamics of the keystone symbiotic   N-fixing species Alnus tenuifolia (thinleaf alder) and the patterns of   primary succession on the Tanana River floodplains of interior Alaska,   USA. The goals of this study were to characterize (i) the variation in   the population structure of thinleaf alder and its influence on   ecosystem function; (ii) the role of a fungal disease outbreak in   driving the population dynamics of thinleaf alder; (iii) the patterns of   landscape-scale thinleaf alder recruitment; and (iv) the variation in   successional pathways across the landscape.   2. Soil N concentrations and pools increased tenfold with thinleaf alder   stand age due to the accumulation of N-rich organic material. Alder stem   density varied threefold among early successional stands, and was   directly related to soil N.   3. The current outbreak of a fungal disease caused widespread branch   dieback and mortality of alder. Young stems were disproportionately   susceptible to disease-induced mortality. Overall disease incidence and   mortality of young stems were positively related to alder stem density.   4.

The population dynamics of thinleaf alder and the   inter-relationship with disease-driven disturbance can strongly   influence soil N accumulation and ecosystem function in primary   succession on an active glacial floodplain.

E+ litter decomposed   faster in both environments. The mean difference between decomposition   rate of E+ and E- litter tended to be higher in E- plots.

We sought to identify traits from   five salt marsh angiosperm species, such as chemical defenses against   snails or fungi, which restrict L. irrorata habitat choice, feeding   patterns, and ability to establish fungal farms. In the field and in   mesocosm experiments, L. irrorata densities were significantly higher on   S. alterniflora than on other available plants, indicating that S.   alterniflora is a favored habitat for I. irrorata. Highly avoided plants   were rich in chemical defenses that rendered these plants unpalatable to   L irrorata in feeding trials, whereas S. alterniflora extracts deterred   L. irrorata feeding only slightly. Removal of plant structure did not   alter L irrorata preferences indicating a negligible role of tissue   toughness as a defense.

The consequences of species loss on ecosystem functioning within a   single trophic level have been extensively studied. However, the loss of   basal species is likely to have profound impacts on the abundance,   richness and ecosystem functioning of species at higher trophic levels.   2. Here, we used experimentally established plant communities with a   species richness gradient to study the effects of plant species loss on   a multi-trophic insect community in the field. We measured densities and   species richness of aphids and parasitic wasps (primary, secondary and   facultative tertiary parasitoids of aphids) that naturally colonized the   grassland plots.   3. Furthermore, we calculated two ecosystem functions: aphid load (the   number of aphid individuals per host plant biomass used as a proxy for   herbivory) and parasitism rate. We used structural equation models to   explore pathways of direct and indirect effects of plant species   richness on higher trophic levels.   4. We found that the densities and richness of species at all trophic   levels were influenced by changes in plant species richness. The effects   were rarely direct, but instead mediated by the abundance and species   richness of aphid host plants and subsequent trophic levels.   5. The herbivore and primary parasitoid levels were most directly   affected by changes in plant species richness, with highest insect   densities and species richness occurring at intermediate plant species   richness. The densities and species richness of secondary parasitoids   declined linearly with plant species richness owing to sparser   resources, resulting in shorter food chains in communities with the   highest plant species richness.   6. Aphid load was highest at intermediate plant species richness and   negatively affected by both host plant biomass and host plant species   richness. Parasitism rate was mostly affected indirectly via aphid   density and overall only weakly negatively related to plant species   richness.   7.

However, tests of such soil effects in field studies   were constrained by experimental limitations to manipulate soil   community composition independent of plant community composition. Here,   we report of an experiment where feedback effects to plants were tested   for both plant and soil monocultures and mixtures.   2. Our results demonstrate that overyielding is the result of plant   species in mixture being more growth-limited by `own' soil biota than by   soil biota of other plant species. This effect disappeared when the   soils had been sterilized by gamma-irradiation. Mixing plants themselves   did not result in overyielding except when grown in the soil of one of   the species (Leucanthemum vulgare), where growth of one species   disproportionally increased in mixture compared to monoculture.   3. Soil nutrient availability could not explain differences in growth   between the non-sterilized soils. Therefore, our results suggest that   plant species-specific soil biota rather than the plants have   contributed to the plant community overyielding.   4. Species biomass ranking in mixtures highly differed between   non-sterilized soils of different histories of soil conditioning, whilst   the ranking was more consistent in sterilized soil. Sterilized soils of   different origin differed significantly in nutrient availability. These   results suggest that shifts in competitive hierarchies depend on plant   species-specific interactions influenced by soil biota and cannot be   induced by mineral nitrogen.   5. Synthesis. Our results show that overyielding in four plant species   mixtures can be due to species-specific interactions between plants and   their specific soil biota.

I sampled 2 streams in the New Jersey   Pine Barrens seasonally for 1 y to measure the biomass density of all   major consumer groups, including macroparasites infecting fish and   macroinvertebrates. Parasites made up a small percentage of consumer   biomass in Pine Barrens streams, representing just 0.00643 to 0.00733\%   of total consumer biomass annually. These low values contrast with   higher estimates from other aquatic ecosystems, where parasite biomass   exceeds that of some free-living consumers.

We documented dynamics of small mammals, birds of   prey, and mammalian carnivores in SNP and agricultural areas. We used   climatic fluctuations and differences between unmodified and   agricultural systems as perturbations to examine trophic processes, key   to understanding responses to climate change and increasing human   pressures. Data were derived from intermittent measures of abundance   collected 1968-1999, combined with systematic sampling 2000-2010 to   construct a 42-year time series.

Field   measurements in turn permit aspects of the physical environment to be   simulated in the laboratory, thereby allowing careful investigation into   the links between odor signal dynamics and insect behavior. Second,   emerging analytical technologies with high recording frequencies and   field-friendly inlet systems may offer new opportunities to characterize   natural odors at spatiotemporal scales relevant to insect perception and   behavior.

These compounds have diverse functions including   defenses against herbivores. Some plants produce alkaloids that act as   acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, increasing both the level and duration   of action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine with potential toxic   effects in insects and mammals. Yet, among a number of neuroactive plant   chemicals, alkaloids that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AIA) display   nootropic activities, that is, positively affect cognition, learning,   and memory in mammals. This creates a paradox: Neuroactive AIA, expected   to punish herbivores, enhance cognition, learning, and memory. A   prevailing view is AIA are pesticides that adversely affecting the   nervous systems of herbivorous insects, and the positive influences in   mammals are merely a by-product of other functions. We review literature   on the behavioral ecology of diet choice, food-aversion learning, and   neurophysiological actions of AIA in mammals to provide a more   comprehensive view of the adaptive significance of AIA. These compounds   act as anti-herbivory defenses that influence flavor (taste plus odor)   preference/aversion, the formation of memories, and the feeding behavior   of mammalian herbivores. Thus, what appears from an insect standpoint to   be an enigma makes sense for mammals: AIA enable mammalian herbivores to   quickly learn and remember specific plant(s) and the locations where   they ate those plant(s). We provide examples of AIA, synthesized by over   200 plant species in 16 families, which affect learning and memory in   mammals. Using 36 examples of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors   synthesized by plants in 58 families, we also show that   acetylcholinesterase blockers contribute to anti-herbivore chemical   defense by affecting food-aversion learning and memory in mammalian   herbivores. We provide an evolutionary rationale for why natural   selection may favor synthesis of chemicals that positively affect mental   functions of herbivores.

The potato phase significantly   decreased the MBC (297.4 and 217.9 mu g C g(-1) Soil), Microbial   quotient (1.48 and 1.28\%), earthworm abundance (73.5 and 31.2 m(-2))   and biomass (32.15 and 12.15 g m(-2)) in 2006 and 2007, respectively.   MBC in 2006 returned to levels found in the reference fields (780.7 mu g   C g(-1) soil) after 3 years (627.0 mu g C g(-1) soil) in the rotation,   however was unable to obtain reference field levels (621.6 mu g C g(-1)   soil) in 2007. Microbial quotient reached comparable levels to the   reference fields (3.69 and 2.80\%) after 3 years (2.85\%) and 4 years   (2.79\%) in rotation in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Mineralizable C was   significantly affected by rotation phase in 1 year only, but this Was   not reflected in the metabolic quotient. Earthworm biomass recovered to   reference field levels (215.44 and 158.21 g m(2)) after 3 years (152.00   g m(2)) and 4 years (156.93 g m(2)) in 2006 and 2007, respectively.   Earthworm abundance consistently required 4 years (450.30 and 434.29   m(2)) in rotation to recover (493.5 and 445 8 m(2)). Overall, results   Suggest that the extended rotations used in organic potato production   systems retain soil organic matter and allow recovery of key attributes   of soil health following the potato phase. Soil biological properties   appear to be more sensitive indicators of these changes. (C) 2009   Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",281,NA,TH,,,,

Understanding factors that influence this process allows   resources for predator control to be applied with maximum effect. This   study examines how predation of a secondary prey species (a relatively   common but declining native plover, the banded dotterel Charadrius   bicinctus) varied with reductions in abundance of a major prey source   (rabbits), kill-trapping of predators, nest density and habitat   complexity. Banded dotterels mostly nest in open braided riverbeds   alongside a number of endemic threatened species. We measured the fate   of 753 dotterel clutches exposed to predation by cats, ferrets and   hedgehogs. We found key times and places of high predation risk.   Immediately after widespread reduction in rabbit populations by rabbit   haemorrhagic disease (RHD), clutch predation rates were almost as high   (mean, 50\%) as those recorded during past rabbit poisoning programmes   (mean, 57\%). Both rates were significantly higher than the mean   predation rate of 22\% without rabbit control, suggesting a shift in   predator diet immediately after rabbit population declines. Unlike after   rabbit poisoning, clutch predation rate remained high in the years after   RHD. Other patterns observed included higher clutch predation rate where   nest density was lower, suggesting that predation can potentially cause   local extinction. Clutch predation was also higher along riverbed   margins where vegetation was dense. There was equivocal evidence for an   effect of predator kill-trapping on clutch predation rate. Management   strategies that could potentially reduce clutch predation risks include   focusing predator mitigation measures during periods of rabbit decline,   maintaining them for more than one breeding season if the rabbit   declines are widespread (e.g. RHD epidemics), and applying greater   effort at sites with relatively low nest density and along riverbed   margins where predator use is more frequent.",282,NA,TH,,,,

However, a wave of forest pests and pathogens is threatening   this worldwide. In this paper we examine the effect of disease on the   optimal rotation length of a single-aged, single rotation forest when a   payment for non-timber benefits, which is offered to private forest   owners to partly internalise the social values of forest management, is   included. Using a generalisable bioeconomic framework we show how this   payment counteracts the negative economic effect of disease by   increasing the optimal rotation length, and under some restrictive   conditions, even makes it optimal to never harvest the forest. The   analysis shows a range of complex interactions between factors including   the rate of spread of infection and the impact of disease on the value   of harvested timber and non-timber benefits. A key result is that the   effect of disease on the optimal rotation length is dependent on whether   the disease affects the timber benefit only compared to when it affects   both timber and non-timber benefits. Our framework can be extended to   incorporate multiple ecosystem services delivered by forests and details   of how disease can affect their production, thus facilitating a wide   range of applications.

The importance of plant-soil interactions in land reclamation, and   the management and restoration of functioning native ecosystems, is   becoming widely recognized. However, relatively little is known about   broad-scale patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in wild   plant-soil symbiotic interactions.   2. The current study is part of a larger project examining patterns of   genetic variation and adaptation in host and symbiont populations across   their geographical ranges using two widespread native Australian Acacia   spp. (A. salicina, A. stenophylla) and associated populations of   rhizobial bacteria.   3. A total of 58 sites were characterized with regard to symbiont   population sizes, soil chemistry and environmental parameters. Rhizobial   abundance was negatively correlated with a small number of soil factors,   including nitrogen, and positively correlated with organic carbon and   cation exchange capacity.   4. There were clear differences between host species in seedling growth   responses in glasshouse trials using pots inoculated with native soils.   While A. salicina grew equally well with soils from A. stenophylla and   A. salicina sites, A. stenophylla grew best when inoculated with its own   soils, indicating broad-scale adaptation to its own rhizobia.   5. Rhizobial abundance in these soils was also strongly correlated to   variation in nodulation and host growth, indicating that abundance may   be a good indicator of the relative effectiveness of rhizobial   populations.   6. The clear differences in specificity and effectiveness of   host-symbiont associations, even among related species, suggests that   better knowledge of these systems at multiple spatial scales is central   to understanding the factors that influence the ecology and evolution of   plant and soil communities, and has potential to increase the   cost-effectiveness of restoration programs.",284,NA,TH,,,,

We hypothesize that invasive   plants would change local AMF community structure in a way that would   benefit themselves but confer less advantages to native plants, thus   influencing the extent of plant interactions. An AMF spore community   composed of five morphospecies of Glomus with equal density (initial AMF   spore community, I-AMF) was constructed to test this hypothesis. The   results showed that the invasive species, Solidago canadensis,   significantly increased the relative abundance of G. geosperum and G.   etunicatum (altered AMP spore community, A-AMF) compared to G. mosseae,   which was a dominant morphospecies in the monoculture of native   Kummerowia striata. The shift in AMF spore community composition driven   by S. canadensis generated functional variation between I-AMP and A-AMF   communities. For example, I-AMP increased biomass and nutrient uptake of   K. striata in both monocultures and mixtures of K. striata and S.   canadensis compared to A-AMP. In contrast, A-AMP significantly enhanced   root nitrogen (N) acquisition of S. canadensis grown in mixture.   Moreover, mycorrhizal-mediated N-15 uptake provided direct evidence that   I-AMF and A-AMF differed in their affinities with native and invading   species. The non-significant effect of A-AMF on K. striata did not   result from allelopathy as root exudates of S. canadensis exhibited   positive effects on seed germination and biomass of K. striata under   naturally occurring concentrations. When considered together, we found   that A-AMF facilitated the invasion of S. canadensis through decreasing   competitiveness of the native plant K. striata. The results supported   our hypothesis and can be used to improve our understanding of an   ecosystem-based perspective towards exotic plant invasion.

However, little is known about how trophic interactions   between species and, in particular, the food webs that these   interactions comprise, change with elevation. Here we present results   for the first comparison of quantitative food webs in forest understorey   and canopy along an elevational gradient. Replicate quantitative food   webs were constructed for assemblages involving 23 species of   cavity-nesting Hymenoptera and 12 species of their parasitoids and   kleptoparasites in subtropical rainforest in Australia. A total of 1589   insects were collected using trap nests across 20 plots distributed at   sites ranging from 300 to 1100 m a.s.l. Insect abundance, insect   diversity and parasitism rate generally decreased with increasing   elevation. Food web structure significantly changed with elevation. In   particular, weighted quantitative measures of linkage density,   interaction evenness, nestedness (weighted NODF) and potential for enemy   mediated interactions (PAC) decreased with increasing elevation, and   network specialisation (H-2) increased with increasing elevation, even   after controlling for matrix size; but there was no change in weighted   connectance. Changes in forest type and temperature along the   elevational gradient are likely to be, at least partly, responsible for   the patterns observed. We found no significant differences in insect   abundance, insect diversity or parasitism rate between canopy and   understorey. Furthermore, there were no differences in food web   structure between strata.

Within a forest, disturbance events can greatly   impact C cycling and subsequently influence the exchange of CO2 between   forests and the atmosphere. This connection makes understanding the   forest C cycle response to disturbance imperative for climate change   research. The goal of this study was to examine the temporal response of   soil respiration after differing levels of stand disturbance for 3 years   at the Black Rock Forest (southeastern NY, USA; oaks comprise 67 \% of   the stand). Tree girdling was used to mimic pathogen attack and create   the following treatments: control, girdling all non-oaks (NOG), girdling   half of the oak trees (O50), and girdling all the oaks (OG). Soil   respiratory rates on OG plots declined for 2 years following girdling   before attaining a full rebound of belowground activity in the third   year. Soil respiration on NOG and O50 were statistically similar to the   control for the duration of the study although a trend for a stronger   decline in respiration on O50 relative to NOG occurred in the first 2   years. Respiratory responses among the various treatments were not   proportional to the degree of disturbance and varied over time. The   short-lived respiratory response on O50 and OG suggests that belowground   activity is resilient to disturbance; however, sources of the recovered   respiratory flux on these plots are likely different than they were   pre-treatment. The differential taxon response between oaks and non-oaks   suggests that after a defoliation or girdling event, the temporal   response of the soil respiratory flux may be related to the C allocation   pattern of the affected plant group.",287,NA,TH,,,,

The aim of VAHINE was to   examine the fate of diazotroph-derived nitrogen (DDN) in a low-nutrient,   low-chlorophyll ecosystem. On day 4 of the experiment, the mesocosm was   fertilized with phosphate. In the lagoon, gene expression was dominated   by the cyanobacterium Synechococcus, closely followed by   Alphaproteobacteria. In contrast, drastic changes in the microbial   community composition and transcriptional activity were triggered within   the mesocosm within the first 4 days, with transcription bursts from   different heterotrophic bacteria in rapid succession. The microbial   composition and activity of the surrounding lagoon ecosystem appeared   more stable, although following similar temporal trends as in M1. We   detected significant gene expression from Chromerida in M1, as well as   the Noumea lagoon, suggesting these photoautotrophic alveolates were   present in substantial numbers in the open water. Other groups   contributing substantially to the metatranscriptome were affiliated with   marine Euryarchaeota Candidatus Thalassoarchaea (inside and outside) and   Myoviridae bacteriophages likely infecting Synechococcus, specifically   inside M1. High transcript abundances for ammonium transporters and   glutamine synthetase in many different taxa (e.g., Pelagibacteraceae,   Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, and Rhodobacteraceae) was consistent   with the known preference of most bacteria for this nitrogen source. In   contrast, Alteromonadaceae highly expressed urease genes;   Rhodobacteraceae and Prochlorococcus showed some urease expression, too.   Nitrate reductase transcripts were detected on day 10 very prominently   in Synechococcus and in Halomonadaceae. Alkaline phosphatase was   expressed prominently only between days 12 and 23 in different   organisms, suggesting that the microbial community was not limited by   phosphate, even before the fertilization on day 4, whereas the   post-fertilization community was.   We observed high expression of the Synechococcus sqdB gene, only   transiently lowered following phosphate fertilization. SqdB encodes   UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, possibly enabling marine picocyanobacteria   to minimize their phosphorus requirements by substitution of   phospholipids with sulphur-containing glycerolipids. This result   suggests a link between sqdB expression and phosphate availability in   situ.   Gene expression of diazotrophic cyanobacteria was mainly attributed to   Trichodesmium and Richelia intracellularis (diatom-diazotroph   association) in the Noumea lagoon and initially in M1. UCYN-A   (Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium) transcripts were the third most   abundant and declined both inside and outside after day 4, consistent   with 16S- and nifH-based analyses.

Both   models performed well and indicated that the data compiled by   participatory programs were useful for generating predictive models of   the potential distribution of this invasive species. The models also   revealed that the potential distribution of B. terrestris is negatively   related to the proportion of woodland area, which corresponds to the   known biology of this species.

It is thought that a   region of East-Southeast Asia with year-round transmission acts as a   source of antigenic diversity for influenza A and seasonal epidemics in   temperate regions make little contribution to antigenic evolution. We   use a mathematical model to examine how different transmission regimes   affect the evolutionary dynamics of influenza over the lifespan of an   antigenic cluster. Our model indicates that, in non-seasonal regions,   mutants that cause significant outbreaks appear before the peak of the   wild-type epidemic. A relatively large proportion of these mutants   spread globally. In seasonal regions, mutants that cause significant   local outbreaks appear each year before the seasonal peak of the   wild-type epidemic, but only a small proportion spread globally. The   potential for global spread is strongly influenced by the intensity of   non-seasonal circulation and coupling between non-seasonal and seasonal   regions. Results are similar if mutations are neutral, or confer a weak   to moderate antigenic advantage. However, there is a threshold antigenic   advantage, depending on the non-seasonal transmission intensity, beyond   which mutants can escape herd immunity in the non-seasonal region and   there is a global explosion in diversity. We conclude that non-seasonal   transmission regions are fundamental to the generation and maintenance   of influenza diversity owing to their epidemiology. More extensive   sampling of viral diversity in such regions could facilitate earlier   identification of antigenically novel strains and extend the critical   window for vaccine development.",290,NA,TH,,,,

As modular genetic elements   that are often conjugative, the selective pressures that act on   plasmid-borne genes are distinct from those that act on the chromosome.   Many bacteria are co-infected by multiple plasmids that impart   niche-specific phenotypes. Thus, in addition to host-plasmid dynamics,   interactions between co-infecting plasmids are likely to be important   drivers of plasmid population dynamics, evolution and ecology.   Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a facultative plant pathogen that commonly   harbours two distinct megaplasmids. Virulence depends on the presence of   the tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid, with benefits that are primarily   restricted to the disease environment. Here, we demonstrate that a   second megaplasmid, the At plasmid, confers a competitive advantage in   the rhizosphere. To assess the individual and interactive costs of these   plasmids, we generated four isogenic derivatives: plasmidless, pAt only,   pTi only and pAtpTi, and performed pairwise competitions under   carbon-limiting conditions. These studies reveal a low cost to the   virulence plasmid when outside of the disease environment, and a   strikingly high cost to the At plasmid. In addition, the costs of pAt   and pTi in the same host were significantly lower than predicted based   on single plasmid costs, signifying the first demonstration of   non-additivity between naturally occurring co-resident plasmids. Based   on these empirically demonstrated costs and benefits, we developed a   resource-consumer model to generate predictions about the frequencies of   these genotypes in relevant environments, showing that non-additivity   between co-residing plasmids allows for their stable coexistence across   environments.",295,NA,TH,,,,

Such outbreaks have resulted in a range of responses   from the social (fishers or farmers) and governing systems. We analyzed   six commercial bivalve industries affected by mass mortalities using   I-ADApT, a decision support framework to assess the impacts and   consequences of these perturbations on the natural, social, and   governing systems, and the consequent responses of stakeholders to these   events. We propose a multidimensional resilience framework to assess   resilience along the natural, social, and governing axes and to compare   adaptive responses and their likelihood of success. The social capital   and governability of the local communities were key factors affecting   the communities' resilience and adaptation to environmental changes, but   the rapid degradation of natural ecosystems puts the bivalve industry   under a growing threat. Bivalve mariculture and fishing industries are   likely to experience increased frequency, severity, and prevalence of   such mass mortality events if the resilience of the natural systems is   not improved.

Disease models typically focus on temporal dynamics of infection,   while often neglecting environmental processes that determine host   movement. In many systems, however, temporal disease dynamics may be   slow compared to the scale at which environmental conditions alter host   space-use and accelerate disease transmission.   2. Using a mechanistic movement modelling approach, we made space-use   predictions of a mobile host (elk [Cervus Canadensis] carrying the   bacterial disease brucellosis) under environmental conditions that   change daily and annually (e.g., plant phenology, snow depth), and we   used these predictions to infer how spring phenology influences the risk   of brucellosis transmission from elk (through aborted foetuses) to   livestock in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.   3. Using data from 288 female elk monitored with GPS collars, we fit   step selection functions (SSFs) during the spring abortion season and   then implemented a master equation approach to translate SSFs into   predictions of daily elk distribution for five plausible winter weather   scenarios (from a heavy snow, to an extreme winter drought year). We   predicted abortion events by combining elk distributions with empirical   estimates of daily abortion rates, spatially varying elk seroprevelance   and elk population counts.   4. Our results reveal strong spatial variation in disease transmission   risk at daily and annual scales that is strongly governed by variation   in host movement in response to spring phenology. For example, in   comparison with an average snow year, years with early snowmelt are   predicted to have 64\% of the abortions occurring on feedgrounds shift   to occurring on mainly public lands, and to a lesser extent on private   lands.   5. Synthesis and applications. Linking mechanistic models of host   movement with disease dynamics leads to a novel bridge between movement   and disease ecology. Our analysis framework offers new avenues for   predicting disease spread, while providing managers tools to proactively   mitigate risks posed by mobile disease hosts. More broadly, we   demonstrate how mechanistic movement models can provide predictions of   ecological conditions that are consistent with climate change but may be   more extreme than has been observed historically.",298,NA,TH,,,,

The evolution of strategies of resource acquisition and allocation is   often considered to be closely dependent on the degree of environmental   variability. Within this framework, female insects that experience   stochastic fluctuations in the availability of their egg-laying sites in   time or space can be expected to be fully synovigenic (i.e. they start   maturing eggs after a delay once reaching adulthood), which allows them   to tailor their reproductive investment to variations in the resource.   Proovigenic females (that have most of their eggs already mature at the   onset of their adult life, which corresponds to a capital breeding   strategy), on the contrary, should have an advantage when the   availability of the egg-laying sites is predictable. There is, however,   a dearth of empirical studies testing these predictions.   2. Here, we tested the hypothesis that four phytophagous insect species   of the genus Curculio, which coexist on a strongly fluctuating resource   that they exploit for egg-laying purposes, would all be synovigenic as   strict proovigeny should be counterselected. The resource consisted of   the acorns of oak trees Quercus spp. We conducted field surveys to   determine the date of adult emergence in each weevil species and the   ability of newly emerged females to produce eggs. We also analysed the   stable isotope profile of wild-caught females as a proxy for their   feeding activity. Finally, we tested females under laboratory conditions   for their ability to produce mature eggs when not fed and investigated   whether dietary intake influenced their longevity.   3. Taken together, our results show that, contrary to the usual   predictions, the four weevil species that were all exposed to a markedly   fluctuating environment exhibited sharply contrasting strategies of   resource acquisition and allocation: three species were synovigenic,   while the fourth was proovigenic. Unexpectedly, therefore, our findings   show that a strict capital breeding species might not always be   counterselected in a temporally stochastic environment. They further   suggest that fluctuations in the environment should not promote a sole,   optimal strategy of energy acquisition and allocation to reproduction   but instead should favour their diversification.",300,NA,TH,,,,

However, due to the complexity of the   indigenous microbiota, it has been extremely difficult to elucidate the   community colonization resistance mechanisms and identify the bacterial   species involved. In a recent study, we have established an in vitro   mice oral microbial community (O-mix) and demonstrated its colonization   resistance against an Escherichia coli strain of mice gut origin. In   this study, we further analyzed the community structure of the O-mix by   using a dilution/regrowth approach and identified the bacterial species   involved in colonization resistance against E. coli.

Despite the ecological importance of this group to   pasture ecosystem functioning, still little is known about its   relationship with grazing management activities. We evaluated the   conservation value of protected areas for clung beetle diversity by   comparing two different management conditions of Mediterranean savanna   in central Spain. Four different sites with wild herbivory (red deer,   roe deer) were sampled inside the Caballeros National Park, and four   sites with traditional agrosilvopastoral management were sampled in a   sheep farm near the park. The dung beetle species richness was similar   between savanna conditions, but the total clung beetle abundance and   biomass were considerably greater in the park grasslands than in the   grasslands of the sheep farm.

It is   viewed as the most promising technology to separate carbon dioxide (CO2)   at point emission sources such as fossil fuel fired power plants as a   part of a strategy called `carbon capture and storage' being deployed to   mitigate climate change. However, there are major challenges in   advancing its use for this application; the most prominent one being -   cost. It is estimated that the application of current technology to CO2   capture will result in a 70-100\% increase in the cost of electricity   (COE). As a part of this two-part study, we have examined the influence   of stripper operating parameters on carbon capture at a 400 MW   pulverized coal-fired power plant retrofitted with amine absorption   technology. We use the process simulation software, ProMax (R) to   simulate the amine absorption process. Three commercial absorbents   namely monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA) and diglycolamine   (DGA) are considered in this work. All the absorbents examined are   studied at the typical working concentrations used in commercial   operation. We also constrain the CO2 loading of rich amine solution to   0.4 mol-CO2/mol-amine to closely resemble the chemical environment in   commercial operation. The main pointer used to compare system   performance is the parasitic power loss due to the carbon capture.   Parasitic power loss comprises of the loss of plant output due to   withdrawal of reboiler steam from the low pressure turbine; the   electricity required for CO2 compression and by the plant auxiliaries   such as blowers and pumps. We also examine the absorber and stripper   column sizes and heat exchanger parameters which are key components of   the system. On the basis of our findings in the first part of this   study, we report that operating the stripper at higher pressures has   significant advantages but also some disadvantages and operational   challenges. We also report that DEA and DGA have a superior performance   to MEA when used in high pressure strippers. We conclude that increasing   the stripper pressure reduces the parasitic losses and the equipment   sizing but may result in higher solvent losses and equipment corrosion.   (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Tick-borne diseases are an important   example where all these complexities are brought together as a result of   the peculiarities of the tick life cycle and the multiple transmission   routes that occur. We show here that one can overcome these complexities   by separating the host population into epidemiologically different types   of individuals and constructing a matrix of reproduction numbers, the   so-called next-generation matrix. Each matrix element is an expected   number of infectious individuals of one type produced by a single   infectious individual of a second type. The largest eigenvalue of the   matrix characterizes the initial exponential growth or decline in   numbers of infected individuals. Values below 1 therefore imply that the   infection cannot establish. The biological interpretation closely   matches that of for disease systems with only one type of individual and   R-0 where infection is directly transmitted. The parameters defining   each matrix element have a clear biological meaning. We illustrate the   usefulness and power of the approach with a detailed examination of   tick-borne diseases, and we use field and experimental data to   parameterize the next-generation matrix for Lyme disease and tick-borne   encephalitis. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses of the matrices, at   the element and individual parameter levels, allow direct comparison of   the two etiological agents. This provides further support that   transmission between cofeeding ticks is critically important for the   establishment of tick-borne encephalitis.",306,NA,TH,,,,

We experimentally examined interactions between two   microparasites (entomopathogenic nematodes) isolated from sandy   grassland soils of coastal California: Heterorhabditis marelatus   (Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema feltiae (Steinernematidae).   Heterorhabditis marelatus drives trophic cascades by attacking root- and   stem-boring ghost moth caterpillars (Hepialus californicus, Hepialidae),   thereby indirectly protecting bush lupine shrubs (Lupinus arboreus,   Fabaceae). Extensive field surveys demonstrated sympatric overlap in   microhabitat use under lupine canopies and similar mean prevalence of   the two nematode species. Using a response-surface design in the   laboratory, we varied relative and absolute microparasite densities to   test for competitive outcomes within an evolutionary naive host, larvae   of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae), and within the   native host Hepialus californicus. Independent of conspecific or   interspecific density, S. feltiae dominated as expected over H.   marelatus within the naive Galleria, but S. feltiae infected hosts at   low frequency and showed lower reproductive fitness than H. marelatus   within native Hepialus hosts. Contrary to studies that demonstrate the   pairwise dominance of steinernematid over heterorhabditid species in   laboratory hosts, host resistance to S. feltiae may provide a mechanism   for coexistence of multiple microparasite species. We hypothesize that   the ubiquitous field prevalence and rapid life history of S. feltiae   imply its use of widespread, abundant but small-bodied hosts and   indicate the lack of direct competition with H. marelatus in the   Hepialus-Lupinus trophic cascade.",307,NA,TH,,,,

We provide evidence that parasites may affect   trophic transfer in aquatic food webs. Many phytoplankton species are   susceptible to parasitic fungi (chytrids). Chytrid infections of diatoms   in lakes may reach epidemic proportions during diatom spring blooms, so   that numerous free-swimming fungal zoospores (2-3 mu m in diameter) are   produced. Analysis shows that these zoospores are rich in   polyunsaturated fatty acids and sterols (particularly cholesterol),   which indicates that they provide excellent food for zooplankters such   as Daphnia. In life-table experiments using the large diatom   Asterionella formosa as food, Daphnia growth increased significantly in   treatments where a parasite was present. By grazing on the zoospores,   Daphnia acquired important supplementary nutrients and were able to   grow. When large inedible algae are infected by parasites, nutrients   within the algal cells are consumed by these chytrids, some of which, in   turn, are grazed by Daphnia. Thus, chytrids transfer energy and   nutrients from their hosts to zooplankton.

Recently, the   birth-death-diversification model was developed to describe the dynamics   of mobile promoters (MPs), a particular class of MGEs in prokaryotes. A   unique feature of this model is that genetic diversification of elements   was included. To explore the implications of diversification on the   longterm fate of MGE lineages, in this contribution we analyze the   extinction probabilities, extinction times and equilibrium solutions of   the birth-death-diversification model. We find that diversification   increases both the survival and growth rate of MGE families, but the   strength of this effect depends on the rate of horizontal gene transfer   (HGT). We also find that the distribution of MGE families per genome is   not necessarily monotonically decreasing, as observed for MPs, but may   have a peak in the distribution that is related to the HGT rate. For MPs   specifically, we find that new families have a high extinction   probability, and predict that the number of MPs is increasing, albeit at   a very slow rate. Additionally, we develop an extension of the   birth-death-diversification model which allows MGEs in different regions   of the genome, for example coding and non-coding, to be described by   different rates. This extension may offer a potential explanation as to   why the majority of MPs are located in non-promoter regions of the   genome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",309,NA,TH,,,,

Such events can flip these systems into a contrasting state that   represents either an alternative attractor or a transient that is slow   enough to persist even if the frequency of events that push the system   to this state is low. Here we show that escape from herbivores is a   mechanism that can play a role in several state shifts of this kind.   This can happen if plants become less susceptible to herbivory as they   grow. Using a model we show that, surprisingly, this mechanism can lead   to a situation where a brief resource pulse for plants may invoke a   persistent shift to a high biomass state whereas gradual enrichment to   the same resource level is insufficient to allow such a change. This   counterintuitive phenomenon occurs if the numerical response of   herbivores is sufficiently slow to allow the plants to use the resource   pulse to escape to a safe biomass at which herbivory is reduced. Our   results imply that rates of environmental change can sometimes be more   important than their magnitude. This has many ramifications. On the   conceptual side, our findings suggest that key mechanisms that regulate   long-term ecosystem dynamics are easily missed by the traditional focus   of modelers on equilibria.

We show how rapid evolution radically alters   the dynamics and outcome of coevolutionary arms races. In particular, a   fast-evolving exploiter can enable victim diversification and thereby   lose a race it is expected to win. We explain simulation results, using   mathematical analysis with relaxed timescale separations.

I   observed a collateral damage problem in southern Costa where people   seeking to control common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus)   indiscriminately killed sympatric, non-target bat species (e.g., by   baiting bats with poisoned bananas). To learn about this phenomenon and   its causes, I developed and implemented a questionnaire based on the   theory of planned behavior. In a sample of 504 men, 14 percent had   individually killed 1-115 bats within the past 5yr, 68 percent had   killed bats as children, and 27 percent said that they would kill bats   that they found roosting on their farms, even if they could not identify   the species. Men who intended to indiscriminately kill bats thought that   it would reduce disease transmission to livestock, whereas men who did   not intend to kill bats thought that killing bats would reduce ecosystem   functioning and/or damage nature. Ultimately, men were more likely to   intend to indiscriminately kill bats if they knew less about bat natural   history and/or had previously suffered vampire bats attacking their   livestock. Men knew more about bat natural history and were less likely   to harbor indiscriminate bat-killing intentions if they had experienced   some form of environmental education. My results suggest that   environmental education will be most effective for bat conservation when   combined with farmer support to ameliorate perceived livelihood risks   associated with vampire bats.   Resumen Los conflictos entre humanos y animales silvestres hacen danos   colaterales cuando la gente tiene la intencion de controlar una especie   problematica y mata otras inadvertidamente. Observe un problema de dano   colateral en el sur de Costa Rica donde la gente con la intencion de   controlar los vampiros comunes (Desmodus rotundus) mataba   indiscriminadamente especies simpatricas y no-objetivas (e.g., por   atraer murcielagos con bananas envenenadas). Para aprender sobre este   fenomeno y sus causas, desarrolle e implemente un cuestionario basado en   la teoria de comportamiento planificado. En una muestra de 504 hombres,   el 14 por ciento habia matado individualmente 1-115 murcielagos entre   los ultimos cinco anos, el 68 por ciento habia matado a murcielagos   cuando eran ninos, y el 27 por ciento menciono matarian a los   murcielagos si los encuentren en sus fincas, incluso si no podian   identificarlos. Los hombres que tenian la intencion de matar los   murcielagos indiscriminadamente pensaban que iba reducir la transmision   de enfermedades a la ganaderia, mientras que hombres que no tenian la   intencion de matar los murcielagos pensaban que matar murcielagos   reduciria las funciones ecosistemicas y/o haria danos a la naturaleza.   Ultimadamente, los hombres fueron mas probables a tener la intencion de   matar murcielagos indiscriminadamente si sabian menos sobre la historia   natural de los murcielagos y si habian sufridos por los murcielagos   vampiros atacando a sus ganados. Hombres sabian mas sobre la historia   natural de murcielagos y eran menos propensos a tener intenciones de   matar murcielagos indiscriminadamente si habian tenidos alguna   experiencia de educacion ambiental. Los resultados sugieren que la   educacion ambiental deberia ser mas eficaz para la conservacion de   murcielagos cuando se combina con apoyo a los ganaderos para aminorar   los riesgos percibidos del sustento asociado con los murcielagos   vampiros.",318,NA,TH,,,,

Structural complexity reflects an increase in   vertical stratification and plant diversity and often leads to a greater   availability of floral resources and nesting sites. Efficient   conservation strategies require understanding of how changes in habitat   structure affect insects that provide essential ecosystem services. We   analyzed how the diversity and species composition of bees and wasps   that nest in pre-existing cavities is affected by habitat complexity.   Our study was developed in the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil,   in the Ubajara National Park and surrounding area. Four types of   habitats within two physiognomies were sampled for two consecutive   years. We used 120 trap-nest (9000 cavities) distributed in 40 sample   points. Overall, 657 cavities were occupied by 11 species of bees, nine   of wasps, and six of cleptoparasitic/parasitoids. Bees and wasp   diversity increases with habitat complexity. While species richness was   higher in more complex physiognomies, abundance was higher in disturbed   areas. Species composition also varied with habitat structure. Habitat   simplification has adverse effects on the diversity and composition of   assemblages. These effects are stronger in more complex habitats   indicating that conservation of humid habitats within semiarid areas is   essential to maintain bee and wasp regional diversity.",320,NA,TH,,,,

In this study, the molecular interactions between potato   (Solanum tuberosum L.), Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa   decemlineata Say; CPB) and Potato virus Y-NTN (PVYNTN) were investigated   through analyses of gene expression in the potato leaves and the gut of   the CPB larvae, and of the release of potato volatile compounds. CPB   larval growth was enhanced when reared on secondary PVYNTN-infected   plants, which was linked to decreased accumulation of transcripts   associated with the antinutritional properties of potato. In   PVYNTN-infected plants, ethylene signalling pathway induction and   induction of auxin response transcription factors were attenuated, while   no differences were observed in jasmonic acid (JA) signalling pathway.   Similarly to rearing on virus-infected plants, CPB larvae gained more   weight when reared on plants silenced in JA receptor gene (coi1).   Although herbivore-induced defence mechanism is regulated predominantly   by JA, response in coi1-silenced plants only partially corresponded to   the one observed in PVYNTN-infected plants, confirming the role of other   plant hormones in modulating this response. The release of -barbatene   and benzyl alcohol was different in healthy and PVYNTN-infected plants   before CPB larvae infestation, implicating the importance of PVYNTN   infection in plant communication with its environment.

Therefore, a mechanistic   knowledge of species interactions, especially those involving foundation   species, may allow for a more complete understanding of how   anthropogenic changes influence nearshore ecosystems. This study   describes the interaction between the seagrass Thalassia testudinum and   the sponge Halichondria melanadocia, a species that grows around the   base of seagrass shoots. A combination of surveys and experimental   manipulations on Abaco Island, The Bahamas, revealed that the   interaction between T. testudinum and H. melanadocia is a commensal   relationship with the sponge benefiting from the presence of T.   testudinum up to medium shoot densities (589-615 shoots per m(2)). The   net neutral effect of H. melanadocia on T. testudinum is likely a   balance of the negative effect of the sponge shading the seagrass with   the positive effect of nitrogen and phosphorus supplied by the sponge.   The mechanisms underlying the interaction between H. melanadocia and T.   testudinum suggest that the interaction is likely context dependent. As   such, environmental change, namely eutrophication, has the potential to   shift the nature of this interaction from commensal to parasitic. A   simple simulation showed that if this relationship becomes parasitic,   above ground production in seagrass beds could be reduced.

Six CHV1 strains of different subtypes were   transferred into three different C. parasitica isolates in order to   assess the effect of different CHV1 strains and/or subtypes on global   cytosine methylation level in infected fungus, using   methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). Infection with   CHV1 affected the methylation pattern of the C. parasitica genome; it   increased the number and diversity of methylated, hemi-methylated, and   total MSAP markers found in infected fungal isolates compared to   virus-free controls. The increase in methylation levels correlated well   with the CHV1-induced reduction of fungal growth in vitro, indicating   that C. parasitica genome methylation upon CHV1 infection, rather than   being the defensive mechanism of the fungus, is more likely to be the   virulence determinant of the virus. Furthermore, the severity of CHV1   effect on methylation levels of infected C. parasitica isolates depended   mostly on individual CHV1 strains and on the combination of host and   virus genomes, rather than on the virus subtype.

Although these 2 concepts are frequently   connected in terms of invasive predators and naive prey, other effects   of invasive species, such the creation of novel habitats by invasive   plants, may also have indirect effects on animal behavior and community   dynamics. We used giving-up densities to examine foraging behavior of   Peromyscus leucopus in forest habitats that were invaded or uninvaded by   the exotic invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii, which forms a novel shrub   layer in hickory oak forests in Missouri. We experimentally manipulated   the presence or absence of an artificial cover over foraging trays and   predicted that rodents would have less of a preference for artificial   cover in invaded sites with high densities of invasive shrub cover. We   found that the invasive shrub decreased perceived predation risk, but   this effect was contingent on other environmental correlates of   predation risk (i.e., clear, moonlit nights) and foraging cost (i.e.,   warm temperatures). Our results demonstrate that invasive plants can   change animal behavior, which may benefit the invasive species by   causing apparent competition and promoting further invasion.

Molecular genetic   mechanisms facilitating range expansion under these conditions are   largely unknown, but understanding these could help mitigate expanding   pests and disease vectors, or help explain why some species fail to   track changing climates. Here, using RNA-seq data, we examine genomewide   changes in gene expression under heat and cold stress in the   range-expanding damselfly Ischnuraelegans in northern Europe. We find   that both the number of genes involved and levels of gene expression   under heat stress have become attenuated during the expansion,   consistent with a previously reported release from selection on heat   tolerances as species move polewards. Genes upregulated under cold   stress differed between core and edge populations, corroborating   previously reported rapid adaptation to cooler climates at the expansion   front. Expression of sixty-nine genes exhibited a region x treatment   effect; these were primarily upregulated in response to heat stress in   core populations but in response to cold stress at the range edge,   suggesting that some cellular responses originally adapted to heat   stress may switch to cold-stress functionality upon encountering novel   thermal selection regimes during range expansion. Transcriptional   responses to thermal stress involving heat-shock and neural function   genes were largely geographically conserved, while retrotransposon,   regulatory, muscle function and defence gene expression patterns were   more variable.

There is increasing evidence of functional   significance to Symbiodinium diversity, which affects the coral   holobiont's response to changing environmental conditions. For example,   corals hosting Symbiodinium from the clade D taxon exhibit greater   resistance to heat-induced coral bleaching than conspecifics hosting the   more common clade C. Yet, the relatively low prevalence of clade D   suggests that this trait is not advantageous in non-stressful   environments. Thus, clade D may only be able to out-compete other   Symbiodinium types within the host habitat when conditions are   chronically stressful. Previous studies have observed enhanced   photosynthesis and fitness by clade C holobionts at non-stressful   temperatures, relative to clade D. Yet, carbon-centered metrics cannot   account for enhanced growth rates and patterns of symbiont succession to   other genetic types when nitrogen often limits reef productivity.

We worked at eleven sites on the   Gulf Coast and eleven sites on the Atlantic Coast, dividing each coast   up into two geographic areas. Abiotic conditions (tidal range, soil   organic content, and water content, but not soil salinity), plant   variables (Spartina nitrogen content, height, cover of dead plant   material, but not live Spartina percent cover or light interception),   and arthropod variables (proportional abundances of predators, sucking   herbivores, stem-boring herbivores, parasitoids, and detritivores, but   not total arthropod numbers) varied among the four geographic regions.   Latitude and mean tidal range explained much of this geographic   variation. Nutrient enrichment increased all arthropod functional groups   in the community, consistent with previous experimental results, and had   similar effects in all geographic regions, contrary to our hypothesis,   suggesting widespread consistency in this aspect of ecosystem function.   The addition of dead plant material had surprisingly little effect on   the arthropod community.

For example, do   plants exhibit similar covariance in defence compounds when evaluated   across a number of sites varying in productivity? Here, we concentrated   on the phenolic profile of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Juniperus   communis and Pinus contorta. Our results indicate striking differences   in secondary chemistry profiles of the twigs including needles of the   trees and in the inter-relationships amongst individual compounds and   groups of compounds. Flavonols occurred in high variety in P. sylvestris   and were highly correlated with each other, differing from P. contorta.   But the results of the factor analyses indicate an underlying pattern   for flavonols of the coumaroyl type for P. contorta. In contrast, the   compounds of the other tree species showed a low degree of   inter-correlation. Co-occurring phenolics of different tree species were   not correlated. Overall, our analysis of site indices indicated that   plant productivity was not a useful predictor for the concentration of   specific phenolics. The relationship amongst plant nitrogen and specific   phenolics might be the result of two defence strategies (one related and   the other not related to nitrogen content). This might enable the plant   to shift its defences against attacks with a high degree of flexibility.",337,NA,TH,,,,

To   evaluate the degree of subdivision in populations of M. phaseolina in   Kansas agriculture and wildlands, we compared 143 isolates from maize   fields adjacent to tallgrass prairie, nearby sorghum fields, widely   dispersed soybean fields and isolates from eight plant species in   tallgrass prairie. Isolate growth phenotypes were evaluated on a medium   containing chlorate. Genetic characteristics were analysed based on   amplified fragment length polymorphisms and the sequence of the   rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The average genetic   similarity was 58\% among isolates in the tallgrass prairie, 71\% in the   maize fields, 75\% in the sorghum fields and 80\% in the dispersed   soybean fields. The isolates were divided into four clusters: one   containing most of the isolates from maize and soybean, two others   containing isolates from wild plants and sorghum, and a fourth   containing a single isolate recovered from Solidago canadensis in the   tallgrass prairie. Most of the sorghum isolates had the dense phenotype   on media containing chlorate, while those from other hosts had either   feathery or restricted phenotypes.

Now there are about 27 million cattle, whose annual dung   production has a dry matter content of about 42 million tonnes. Until   CSIRO introduced exotic dung beetles in the 1960s, the dung of these   herbivores sat on the soil surface, sometimes for years, locking up   organic matter, smothering pasture and polluting waterways. CSIRO   introduced 53 exotic dung beetle species, of which 43 were released to   the Australian mainland between 1965 and 1985. Twenty-three of these   have become established, many of which have reached the natural limits   of their distribution.

Specifically, we examined how plant genotype, the relative   size of genotypic patches, and the rate of insect dispersal between   them, affect the frequency, amplitude, and duration of outbreaks. We   found that coupling two different genotypes does not necessarily result   in an averaging of insect dynamics. Instead, depending on the ratio of   patch sizes, when dispersal rates are moderate, outbreaks in the   two-genotype case may be more or less severe than in forests of either   genotype alone. Thresholds for different dynamic behaviors were similar   for all genotypic combinations.

Species interactions, ranging from antagonisms to mutualisms, form   the architecture of bio-diversity and determine ecosystem functioning.   Understanding the rules responsible for who interacts with whom, as well   as the functional consequences of these interspecific interactions, is   central to predict community dynamics and stability.   2. Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological processes   by determining species interactions through a two-step process. First,   ecological and life-history traits govern species distributions and   abundance, and hence determine species co-occurrence and the potential   for species to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits   between co-occurring potential interaction partners should match for the   realization of an interaction. Here, we review recent advances on   predicting interactions from species co-occurrence and develop a   probabilistic model for inferring trait matching.   3. The models proposed here integrate both neutral and trait-matching   constraints, while using only information about known interactions,   thereby overcoming problems originating from undersampling of rare   interactions (i.e. missing links).

However, the predictive power of PSF in field   contexts is mixed, and ecologists do not yet understand its relative   importance compared to other factors that structure communities. Further   progress requires a more nuanced understanding of how PSF interacts with   other biotic and abiotic factors. Environmental factors (e.g. natural   enemies, moisture, light, nutrients) are known to affect plant   interactions with soil and soil organisms, leading to an expectation of   environmental context dependence in plant-soil feedback. Such context   dependence could explain when PSF is expected to be an important driver   of community dynamics, and under what conditions PSF is likely to be   positive (destabilizing) vs negative (stabilizing).

They can be transmitted horizontally and can thrive in   the host cell to high-copy numbers. Plasmid replication and gene   expression consume cellular resources and cells carrying plasmids incur   fitness costs. But many plasmids carry genes that can be beneficial   under certain conditions, allowing the cell to endure in the presence of   antibiotics, toxins, competitors or parasites. Horizontal transfer of   plasmid-encoded genes can thus instantaneously confer differential   adaptation to local or transient selection conditions. This conflict   between cellular fitness and plasmid spread sets the scene for   multilevel selection processes. We have engineered a system to study the   short-term evolutionary impact of different synonymous versions of a   plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance gene. Applying experimental   evolution under different selection conditions and deep sequencing   allowed us to show rapid local adaptation to the presence of antibiotic   and to the specific version of the resistance gene transferred. We   describe the presence of clonal interference at two different levels: at   the within-cell level, because a single cell can carry several plasmids,   and at the between-cell level, because a bacterial population may   contain several clones carrying different plasmids and displaying   different fitness in the presence/absence of antibiotic. Understanding   the within-cell and between-cell dynamics of plasmids after horizontal   gene transfer is essential to unravel the dense network of mobile   elements underlying the worldwide threat to public health of antibiotic   resistance.",357,NA,TH,,,,

Translocations increase the risk of   disease outbreaks in the translocated and recipient populations.   Qualitative disease risk analyses have been used as a means of assessing   the magnitude of any effect of disease and the probability of the   disease occurring associated with a translocation. Currently multiple   alternative qualitative disease risk analysis packages are available to   practitioners. Here we compare the ease of use, expertise required,   transparency, and results from, three different qualitative disease risk   analyses using a translocation of the endangered New Zealand passerine,   the hihi (Notiomystis cincta), as a model. We show that the three   methods use fundamentally different approaches to define hazards.   Different methods are used to produce estimations of the risk from   disease, and the estimations are different for the same hazards.   Transparency of the process varies between methods from no referencing,   or explanations of evidence to justify decisions, through to full   documentation of resources, decisions and assumptions made. Evidence to   support decisions on estimation of risk from disease is important, to   enable knowledge acquired in the future, for example, from translocation   outcome, to be used to improve the risk estimation for future   translocations. Information documenting each disease risk analysis   differs along with variation in emphasis of the questions asked within   each package. The expertise required to commence a disease risk analysis   varies and an action flow chart tailored for the non-wildlife health   specialist are included in one method but completion of the disease risk   analysis requires wildlife health specialists with epidemiological and   pathological knowledge in all three methods.

Seagrasses have key   ecological roles in coastal ecosystems and can form extensive meadows   supporting high biodiversity. The global species diversity of seagrasses   is low (<60 species), but species can have ranges that extend for   thousands of kilometers of coastline. Seagrass bioregions are defined   here, based on species assemblages, species distributional ranges, and   tropical and temperate influences. Six global bioregions are presented:   four temperate and two tropical. The temperate bioregions include the   Temperate North Atlantic, the Temperate North Pacific, the   Mediterranean, and the Temperate Southern Oceans. The Temperate North   Atlantic has low seagrass diversity, the major species being Zostera   marina, typically occurring in estuaries and lagoons. The Temperate   North Pacific has high seagrass diversity with Zostera spp. in estuaries   and lagoons as well as Phyllospadix spp. in the surf zone. The   Mediterranean region has clear water with vast meadows of moderate   diversity of both temperate and tropical seagrasses, dominated by   deep-growing Posidonia oceanica. The Temperate Southern Oceans bioregion   includes the temperate southern coastlines of Australia, Africa and   South America. Extensive meadows of low-to-high diversity temperate   seagrasses are found in this bioregion, dominated by various species of   Posidonia and Zostera. The tropical bioregions are the Tropical Atlantic   and the Tropical Indo-Pacific, both supporting mega-herbivore grazers,   including sea turtles and sirenia. The Tropical Atlantic bioregion has   clear water with a high diversity of seagrasses on reefs and shallow   banks, dominated by Thalassia testudinum. The vast Tropical Indo-Pacific   has the highest seagrass diversity in the world, with as many as 14   species growing together on reef flats although seagrasses also occur in   very deep waters. The global distribution of seagrass genera is   remarkably consistent north and south of the equator; the northern and   southern hemispheres share ten seagrass genera and only have one unique   genus each. Some genera are much more speciose than others, with the   genus Halophila having the most seagrass species. There are roughly the   same number of temperate and tropical seagrass genera as well as   species. The most widely distributed seagrass is Ruppia maritima, which   occurs in tropical and temperate zones in a wide variety of habitats.   Seagrass bioregions at the scale of ocean basins are identified based on   species distributions which are supported by genetic patterns of   diversity. Seagrass bioregions provide a useful framework for   interpreting ecological, physiological and genetic results collected in   specific locations or from particular species.

In order to test the hypothesis that the role   of saprotrophic fungi in rhizosphere processes increases with increased   time after abandonment from agriculture, we determined the composition   of fungi that are active in the rhizosphere along a chronosequence of   ex-arable fields in the Netherlands. Intact soil cores were collected   from nine fields that represent three stages of land abandonment and   pulse labeled with (CO2)-C-13.

In   common with some other global hotspots, this region has high levels of   alpha, beta and gamma diversity characterized by local endemism and   spatial turnover of species. The region therefore includes a suite of   highly localized species assemblages in complex mosaics across the   landscape. Such landscapes pose particular challenges for assessing   risks to biodiversity because the status of the most extensive species   assemblages within broad scale assessment units tends to mask the status   of those that are most restricted. Hence, risk assessments at different   thematic scales may sometimes reveal different outcomes and salient   threats. We examined these expectations by applying the IUCN Red List   criteria for ecosystems at a fine thematic scale to assess risks to   shrublands on southern Swan Coastal Plain ironstones, one of the most   restricted ecosystems in the region, distinguished by its component   suite of endemic flora. The ecosystem was found to be critically   endangered due to its declining distribution and restricted current   extent in combination with threats, particularly weed invasion. These   outcomes suggest two scaling effects when a broader suite of assemblages   in the region are considered; the perceived levels of risk may be less   extreme; and the main threatening processes that influence risk   assessment outcomes rank differently in importance. Both effects are   critical to future management to promote persistence of ecosystems, as   the priorities and actions will vary between local and regional scales,   as will their conservation outcomes. In this case the major needs are to   limit vegetation clearing and water extraction and mitigate the invasion   of weeds and impacts of disease.

Nonetheless, accurate,   high-resolution abundance distributions are essential for many   ecological applications ranging from species conservation to   epidemiology. Producing models that can predict abundance well, with   good resolution over large areas, has therefore been an important aim in   ecology, but poses considerable challenges. We present a two-stage   approach to modeling abundance, combining two established techniques.   First, we produce ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) of trees   in Great Britain at a fine resolution, using much more common   presence-absence data and key environmental variables. We then use   random forest regression to predict abundance by linking the results of   the SDMs to a much smaller amount of abundance data. We show that this   method performs well in predicting the abundance of 20 of 25 tested   British tree species, a group that is generally considered challenging   for modeling distributions due to the strong influence of human   activities. Maps of predicted tree abundance for the whole of Great   Britain are provided at 1km(2) resolution. Abundance maps have a far   wider variety of applications than presence-only maps, and these maps   should allow improvements to aspects of woodland management and   conservation including analysis of habitats and ecosystem functioning,   epidemiology, and disease management, providing a useful contribution to   the protection of British trees.

Both evolutionary theory and empirical evidence from agricultural   research support the view that asexual, vertically transmitted fungal   endophytes are typically plant mutualists that develop high infection   frequencies within host grass populations. In contrast, endophyte-grass   interactions in natural ecosystems are more variable, spanning the range   from mutualism to antagonism and comparatively little is known about   their range of response to environmental stress.   2. We examined patterns in endophyte prevalence and endophyte-grass   interactions across nutrient and grazing (from Greylag and Canada geese)   gradients in 15 sites with different soil moisture levels in 13 island   populations of the widespread grass Festuca rubra in a boreal   archipelago in Sweden.   3. In the field, endophyte prevalence levels were generally low (range =   10-53\%) compared with those reported from agricultural systems. Under   mesic-moist conditions endophyte prevalence was constantly low (mean   prevalence = 15\%) and was not affected by grazing pressure or nutrient   availability. In contrast, under conditions of drought, endophyte   prevalence increased from 10\% to 53\% with increasing nutrient   availability and increasing grazing pressure.   4. In the field, we measured the production of flowering culms, as a   proxy for host fitness, to determine how endophyte-infected plants   differed from uninfected plants. At dry sites, endophyte infection did   not affect flowering culm production. In contrast, at mesic-moist sites   production of flowering culms in endophyte-infected plants increased   with the covarying effects of increasing nutrient availability and   grazing pressure, indicating that the interaction switched from   antagonistic to mutualistic.   5. A concurrent glasshouse experiment showed that in most situations,   the host appears to incur some costs for harbouring endophytes.   Uninfected grasses generally outperformed infected grasses (antagonistic   interaction), while infected grasses outperformed uninfected grasses   (mutualistic interaction) only in dry, nutrient-rich conditions.   Nutrient and water addition affected tiller production, leaf number and   leaf length differently, suggesting that tillers responded with   different strategies. This emphasizes that several response variables   are needed to evaluate the interaction.   6. Synthesis. This study found complex patterns in endophyte prevalence   that were not always correlated with culm production. These contrasting   patterns suggest that the direction and strength of selection on   infected plants is highly variable and depends upon a suite of   interacting environmental variables that may fluctuate in the intensity   of their impact, during the course of the host life cycle.",368,NA,TH,,,,

In this review, we found   lignin comprises a complex class of organic compounds whose   concentration differs greatly both between and within plant species.   There are many analytical methods for detecting the composition and   structure of lignins. As lignins are enormously complex compounds,   chemical assay is difficult and different methods vary with the results.   Lignin plays a significant role in the carbon cycle, sequestering   atmospheric carbon into the living tissues of woody perennial   vegetation. It has also great effects on nitrogen dynamics of forest   ecosystems as well as other ecological processes. Lignin is one of the   most slowly decomposing components of dead vegetation, contributing a   major fraction of the material that becomes humus as it decomposes.   Lignin is highly correlated with decomposition of litter. Thus, there is   evidence that the lignin concentration is a more influential factor than   the other chemical concentrations, in determining the rate of leaf   litter decomposition of different forest ecosystems.

We assess the in vivo growth   rate, doubling time, biomass yield, glycolytic flux, and enzyme   expression of T. evansi. Then, we explore the metabolic changes likely   occurring during its growth. At low T evansi densities, most host   glucose is used to produce energy, which results in the release of   pyruvate.

Social bees are essential insect   pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global   decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible   cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the   risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides   typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports   suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits   such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little   about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative   impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency   Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day   foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when   exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid   (-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period.   This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and   individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging   behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show   that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on   overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies   improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience,   the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic   behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that   pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types   from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of   considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when   assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic   pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both   colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these   essential insect pollinators. <doi origin=''wiley''   registered=''yes''>10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi",374,NA,TH,,,,

Synchronized mass production of seed crops, such as acorns, produces   a resource pulse that may have far-reaching consequences for songbird   populations through its effects on avian predators. Seed production in   these forests represents only the first of several pulsed events.   Secondary pulses emerge as mast-consuming rodents numerically respond to   seed production and tertiary pulses emerge as generalist predators, such   as raptors, numerically respond to rodents. In turn, these two groups   reduce nest productivity and juvenile survivorship 1 and 2 years,   respectively, after the initial pulse in seed production.   2. At our study site in south-eastern New York, USA, autumn acorn   abundance (primary pulse) largely determines rodent abundance (secondary   pulse) the following spring. We tested the hypotheses that the   population dynamics of a shrub-nesting passerine (wood thrush Hylocichla   mustelina), is influenced by rodents through the: (a) direct effect of   predation by rodents; (b) indirect effect of rodents on the abundance of   raptors (tertiary pulse); and (c) indirect effect of rodent abundance on   raptor diet. The latter specifically hypothesizes that a crash in the   rodent population in the wake of region-wide failure of acorn production   leads to an extreme diet shift in raptors that increases post-fledging   mortality in birds.   3. We conducted a 3-year study to examine variation in wood thrush nest   success and fledgling survival, using radio telemetry, across a pulse of   rodent abundance (i.e. low, medium and high). We also updated and   reanalysed regional wood thrush population growth rates as a function of   the annual variation in rodent abundance.   4. Fledgling survivorship, but not nest success, varied in relation to   annual rodent abundance. Raptors and eastern chipmunks Tamias striatus   were the most commonly identified predators on fledglings. Fledgling   survivorship was greatest at intermediate rodent abundance consistent   with a shift in raptor diet. Regional rate of wood thrush population   growth showed a unimodal relationship with rodent abundance, peaking   during years with intermediate rodent abundance. This unimodal pattern   was due to wood thrush population growth rates near or below zero during   rodent population crashes.   5. The telemetry study, pattern of regional abundance and synchronized   population dynamics of coexisting thrushes suggest a common mechanism of   behavioural changes in raptors in response to declines in rodent prey,   which in turn affects thrush population dynamics.",375,NA,TH,,,,

The Messel lake web, with 94   taxa, displays unambiguous similarities in structure to extant webs.   While the Messel forest web, with 630 taxa, displays differences   compared to extant webs, they appear to result from high diversity and   resolution of insect-plant interactions, rather than substantive   differences in structure.

Such habitat change, however, might also   lead to increased exposure to disease. In this article, we test measures   of susceptibility and exposure to explain the prevalence and intensity   of directly and indirectly transmitted helminths in black howler monkeys   (Alouatta pigra) following a hurricane in Belize. None of these   parasites were predicted by direct measures of susceptibility (as   measured by fruit consumption and fecal cortisol levels). Rather,   directly transmitted parasites (Trichuris sp. and strongylid type eggs.)   were predicted by host density and group size, both measures of   exposure. Similarly, only the consumption of Cecropia peltata, a fast   growing pioneer that has a mutualistic relationship with ants predicted   levels of the indirectly transmitted trematode Controrchis spp., also   suggesting exposure. Cecropia peltata also increased in density   post-hurricane, was high in digestible protein, sugar, and salt and   eaten by monkeys more frequently than predicted based on distribution.   These data suggest that in this hurricane-damaged forest the ingestion   of this abundant and nutritious pioneer species increased exposure of   the monkeys to Controrchis through ingestion of ant intermediate hosts.   These results may point to a pattern true of pioneer species in general,   leaving animals in disturbed forests with higher levels of parasitism as   a result of changes to forest structure. As severe weather events are   expected to increase, this suggests a cascading effect of climate change   on ecosystem interactions and disease ecology.",381,NA,TH,,,,

Fluctuations of prey availability, especially those caused by changes in   their circadian rhythms, provoke seasonal migrations and omnivory in   predators. We also present experimental evidence of the effects of   interactions between aboveground and belowground macroarthropods on   litter degradation: belowground detritivores are responsible for a high   percentage of ground surface litter decomposition.

We examined 20 amphibian cutaneous bacteria   for the production of prodigiosin or violacein, brightly colored defense   compounds that pigment the bacteria and have characteristic   spectroscopic properties making them readily detectable, and evaluated   the antifungal activity of these compounds. We detected violacein from   all six isolates of Janthinobacterium lividum on frogs from the USA,   Switzerland, and on captive frogs originally from Panama. We detected   prodigiosin from five isolates of Serratia plymuthica or S. marcescens,   but not from four isolates of S. fonticola or S. liquefaciens.

When   applied to cultures of chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)   and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal), prodigiosin caused significant growth   inhibition, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 10 and 50 mu   M, respectively. Violacein showed a MIC of 15 mu M against both fungi   and was slightly more active against Bsal than Bd at lower   concentrations. Although neither violacein nor prodigiosin showed   aerosol activity and is not considered a volatile organic compound   (VOC), J. lividum and several Serratia isolates did produce antifungal   VOCs. White Serratia isolates with undetectable prodigiosin levels could   still inhibit Bd growth indicating additional antifungal compounds in   their chemical arsenals. Similarly, J. lividum can produce antifungal   compounds such as indole-3-carboxaldehyde in addition to violacein, and   isolates are not always purple, or turn purple under certain growth   conditions. When Serratia isolates were grown in the presence of   cell-free supernatant (CFS) from the fungi, CFS from Bd inhibited growth   of the prodigiosin-producing isolates, perhaps indicative of an   evolutionary arms race; Bsal CFS did not inhibit bacterial growth. In   contrast, growth of one J. lividum isolate was facilitated by CFS from   both fungi.

In this article, we   investigated how seedling establishment is affected in the understory of   restoration sites of different ages and assessed some of the potential   environmental factors controlling this ecological process. We first   compared the density and richness of native tree seedlings among 10-,   22-, and 55-year-old restoration plantations within the Atlantic Forest   region of southeastern Brazil. Then, we undertook a seed addition   experiment in each study site, during the wet season, and compared   seedling emergence, survival, and biomass on local versus old-growth   forest soil (transferred from a reference ecosystem), in order to test   whether local substrate could hamper seedling establishment. As   expected, the oldest restoration site had higher density and richness of   spontaneously regenerating seedlings. However, seedling establishment   was less successful both in the oldest restoration planting and using   substrate transferred from a reference ecosystem, where emergence and   survival were lower, but surviving seedlings grew better. We attribute   these results to lower light availability for seedlings in the   understory of the oldest site and speculate that higher incidence of   pathogens on old-growth forest soil may have increased seedling   mortality. We conclude that the understory of young restoration   plantations provides suitable microsite conditions at the early   establishment phases for the spontaneous regeneration or enrichment   planting of native trees.",391,NA,TH,,,,

Here, we address   this issue by presenting a quantitative model of cell lifespan and cell   replicative capacity. The model is based on the relationship between   cell mortality and metabolic rate, which is supported with data for   different cell types from ectotherms and endotherms. These data indicate   that much of the observed variation in cell lifespan and cell   replicative capacity is explained by differences in cellular metabolic   rate, and thus by the three primary factors that control metabolic rate:   organism size, organism temperature and cell size. Individual cell   lifespan increases as a power law with both body mass and cell mass, and   decreases exponentially with increasing temperature. The replicative   capacity of cells also increases with body mass, but is independent of   temperature.

Working along a steep natural gradient of soil fertility   in a Costa Rican tropical dry forest, we examined how soil nutrients   affect plant-microbe interactions using two complementary approaches.   First, we measured mycorrhizal colonization of roots and soil P   availability in 18 permanent plots spanning the soil fertility gradient.   We measured root production, root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi,   phosphatase activity and Bray P in each of 144 soil cores. Next, in a   full-factorial manipulation of soil type and microbial community origin,   tree seedlings of Albizia guachapele and Swietenia macrophylla were   grown in sterilized high-, intermediate- and low-fertility soils paired   with microbial inoculum from each soil type. Seedling growth, biomass   allocation and root colonization by mycorrhizas were quantified after 2   mo. In the field, root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi was unrelated   to soil phosphorus across a five-fold gradient of P availability. In the   shadehouse, inoculation with soil microbes had either neutral or   positive effects on plant growth, suggesting that positive effects of   mycorrhizal symbionts outweighed negative effects of soil pathogens. The   presence of soil microbes had a greater effect on plant biomass than   variation in soil nutrient concentrations (although both effects were   modest), and plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation were not   dependent on soil nutrients.

Yet, the efficacy of   these schemes in delivering multiple ecosystem services is usually   limited by our poor understanding of how plant species composition,   functional traits and trait diversity affect insect visitation and   resource use. Here we investigate the effects of plant floral traits and   trait diversity on flower visitation by three functionally distinct   beneficial insect groups, which provide crop pollination and pest   control services: bumblebees, hoverflies and parasitoid wasps. We   created plots that contained plants with either long or short-corolla   flowers, as well as mixed plots, which contained plants presenting both   floral traits concurrently. In functionally simple plots, insect groups   exhibited distinct floral associations, with bumblebees being almost   exclusively associated with long-corolla flower plots, whereas   parasitoids and hoverflies strongly favoured plots with short-corolla   flowers. When these flower types were planted in combination   (mixed-trait plots), bumblebee and hoverfly visitation was maintained at   the level of their respective preferred single-trait plot, but   parasitoid visitation was reduced by 50\%. Thus, the informed selection   of functionally diverse flower patches can be an effective tool to   attract a higher diversity of insect groups than functionally simple   plots.

The aim of the study was to quantify the relative importance of   predation, negative density feedback and abiotic factors in driving Ips   typographus population dynamics. We analyzed a unique time series of   population density of I. typographus and its main predator Thanasimus   formicarius over almost two decades in four regions across Sweden. We   used a discrete population model and a multi-model inference approach to   evaluate the importance of both bottom up and top down factors. We found   that availability of breeding substrates in the form of storm-felled   trees was the main outbreak trigger, while strong intra-specific   competition for host trees was the main endogenous regulating factor.   Although temperature-related metrics are known to have strong individual   effect on I. typographus development and number of generations, they did   not emerge as important drivers of population dynamics. A positive   effect of low summer rainfall was evident only in the region located in   the southernmost and warmest part of the spruce distribution range in   Sweden. Predator density did not emerge as an important prey regulating   factor. As the reported damage from storms seems to have increased   across whole Europe, spruce forests are expected to be increasingly   susceptible to large outbreaks of I. typographus with important economic   and ecological consequences for boreal ecosystems.

Mitochondria and Wolbachia may interact   antagonistically and compete as each population tries to ensure its own   evolutionary success. Alternatively, mitochondria and Wolbachia may   cooperate as both benefit from ensuring the fitness of the mother. We   characterized the relationship between mitochondria and Wolbachia titers   in ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster.

To address this   problem, sustainable increase of cocoa yield on current plantations is   needed. On a 22-year-old, 61 ha cocoa plantation in peninsular Malaysia,   shade tree planting and soil management treatments, including targeted   mineral fertilization, intense organic fertilization and combinations of   these with compost application and cover crop (Centrosema pubescens)   planting, were assessed as a rehabilitation strategy of degraded cocoa   plantations with sub-optimum yield. Treatment effects on cocoa yield and   on proxy indicators soil fauna abundance and diversity, and soil   nutrient status, was tested 3.5 years after implementation in four   harvesting rounds between 28 November 2014 and 12 March 2015. Across all   treatments, large differences were found in the yield of the two clones   tested (PBC130 and PBC123). The effect of shade trees (mainly Musa sp.,   with some permanent shade trees) on yield interacted with the factor   `clone'. Mean wet bean yield of PBC123 trees in full-sun cultivation was   0.74 kg as compared with 1.08 kg for trees in the agroforestry system   (46\% increase). Mean wet bean yield of PBC130 trees, however, was 20\%   lower in the same agroforestry system (0.08 kg) in comparison with mean   wet bean yield of trees in full-sun cultivation (0.10 kg). Soil   management treatments did not result in clear yield improvement as   compared with common-practice, control plots. However, cover crop   treatment had a positive effect on proxy indicators soil nutrient status   and endogeic soil fauna diversity. It is concluded that in the   rehabilitation of degraded cocoa plantations, possible yield impact of   applying a straightforward agroforestry system, as the one in our   experiments, is high. Furthermore, it was shown that in a degraded   plantation with a long history of intensive fertilization, improved soil   management has little effect. Positive effects of shade trees on cocoa   yield are therefore probably linked with the creation of an environment   that improves cocoa crop physiology and reduces pressure of pests and   diseases, rather than with the improvement of soil quality as a   consequence of intercropping with trees.

However, T. repens lines exhibited   variable levels of resistance and tolerance to virus infection and ClYVV   isolates differed in infectivity and aggressiveness, with grassland   isolates having a greater pathogenic effect on associated host plants   than woodland isolates. We conclude that ClYVV potentially plays an   important role in limiting the size of T. repens populations in some   at-risk non-target ecosystems and that second-tier field experiments are   required to adequately quantify the risk associated with the commercial   release of V-R T. repens genotypes in Australia.",404,NA,TH,,,,

In a full factorial outdoor mesocosm   experiment we introduced grasshoppers (aboveground herbivores),   wireworms (belowground herbivores) and a diverse soil nematode community   to species-rich model plant communities. After two years, insect   herbivore effects on nematode diversity and on abundance of herbivorous,   bacterivorous, fungivorous and omni-carnivorous nematodes were evaluated   in relation to plant community composition.   Wireworms did not affect nematode diversity despite enhanced plant   diversity, while grasshoppers, which did not affect plant diversity,   reduced nematode diversity. Although grasshoppers and wireworms caused   contrasting shifts in plant species dominance, they did not affect   abundances of decomposer nematodes at any trophic level. Primary   consumer nematodes were, however, strongly promoted by wireworms, while   community root biomass was not altered by the insect herbivores.   Overall, interaction effects of wireworms and grasshoppers on the soil   nematodes were not observed, and we found no support for bottom-up   control of the nematodes. However, our results show that above- and   belowground insect herbivores may facilitate root-feeding rather than   decomposer nematodes and that this facilitation appears to be driven by   shifts in plant species composition. Moreover, the addition of nematodes   strongly suppressed shoot biomass of several forb species and reduced   grasshopper abundance. Thus, our results suggest that nematode feedback   effects on plant community composition, due to plant and herbivore   parasitism, may strongly depend on the presence of insect herbivores.",405,NA,TH,,,,

Individuals were considered to be a part of the same   transmission chain and were interlinked in the transmission network if   they shared genetic subtypes of E.coli. By using microbial genetics to   quantify who transmits to whom independently from the behavioural data   on who is in contact with whom, we were able to directly investigate how   the structure of contact networks influences the structure of the   transmission network. To distinguish between the effects of social and   environmental contact on transmission dynamics, the transmission network   was compared with two separate contact networks defined from the   behavioural data: a social network based on association patterns, and a   spatial network based on patterns of home-range overlap among   individuals.

This indicates that an individual's social   network position is predictive of transmission network position, which   has implications for identifying individuals that function as   super-spreaders or transmission bottlenecks in the population. These   results emphasize the importance of association patterns in   understanding transmission dynamics, even for environmentally   transmitted microbes like E.coli. This study is the first to use   microbial genetics to construct and analyse transmission networks in a   wildlife population and highlights the potential utility of an approach   integrating microbial genetics with network analysis.",407,NA,TH,,,,

Tolerance aims to minimize the fitness effects   resulting from incumbent pathogen populations, whereas resistance aims   to reduce the pathogen population size within the host. While   environmental impacts on resistance have been extensively, recorded   their impacts on variation in tolerance are virtually unexplored.   Here, we ask how the environment, namely the host diet, influences the   capacity of an organism to tolerate and resist infection, using a model   host-parasite system, the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides and   the entomopathogenic bacteria, Photorhabdus luminescens.   We first considered dose-responses and pathogen dynamics within the   host, and compared our findings to responses known from other host   species. We then investigated how investment in tolerance and resistance   changed under different nutritional regimes. Beetles were maintained on   one of five diets that varied in their ratio of protein to fat for 48hr   and then injected with P.luminescens. Survival was monitored and the   phenoloxidase (PO) response and bacterial load at 24-hr postinfection   were ascertained.   The dose required to kill 50\% of individuals in this species was   several magnitudes higher than in other species and the bacteria were   shown to display massive decreases in population size, in contrast to   patterns of proliferation found in other host species. Diet strongly   modified host survival after infection, with those on the high fat/low   protein diet showing 30\% survival at 8 days, vs. almost 0\% survival on   the low-fat/high-protein diet. However, this was independent of   bacterial load or variation in PO, providing evidence for diet-mediated   tolerance mechanisms rather than immune-driven resistance.   Evolutionary ecology has long focussed on immune resistance when   investigating how organisms avoid succumbing to infection. Tolerance of   infection has recently become a much more prominent concept and is   suggested to be influential in disease dynamics. This is one of the   first studies to find diet-mediated tolerance.",410,NA,TH,,,,

Incorporation of prey- and predator-dependent interactions among   foragers in the model produces predator isoclines with potentials for   highly complex consumer-resource dynamics. Facilitation and interference   during the foraging cycle are therefore suggested as potent behavioral   mechanisms to cause patterns of community dynamics.

Biocontrol is a key tool for reducing the impacts of   serious, widespread exotic weeds. We review the nearly 90-year history   of weed biocontrol research in New Zealand. Thirty-eight species of   agents have been established against 17 targets. Establishment success   rates are high, the safety record remains excellent, and support for   biocontrol remains strong.

Nonnative insects have accumulated in United States forests at a rate of   similar to 2.5 per yr over the last 150 yr. Currently the two major   pathways of introduction are importation of live plants and wood packing   material such as pallets and crates. Introduced insects and diseases   occur in forests and cities throughout the United States, and the   problem is particularly severe in the Northeast and Upper Midwest.   Nonnative forest pests are the only disturbance agent that has   effectively eliminated entire tree species or genera from United States   forests within decades. The resulting shift in forest structure and   species composition alters ecosystem functions such as productivity,   nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat. In urban and suburban areas,   loss of trees from streets, yards, and parks affects aesthetics,   property values, shading, stormwater runoff, and human health. The   economic damage from nonnative pests is not yet fully known, but is   likely in the billions of dollars per year, with the majority of this   economic burden borne by municipalities and residential property owners.   Current policies for preventing introductions are having positive   effects but are insufficient to reduce the influx of pests in the face   of burgeoning global trade. Options are available to strengthen the   defenses against pest arrival and establishment, including measures   taken in the exporting country prior to shipment, measures to ensure   clean shipments of plants and wood products, inspections at ports of   entry, and post-entry measures such as quarantines, surveillance, and   eradication programs. Improved data collection procedures for   inspections, greater data accessibility, and better reporting would   support better evaluation of policy effectiveness. Lack of additional   action places the nation, local municipalities, and property owners at   high risk of further damaging and costly invasions. Adopting stronger   policies to reduce establishments of new forest insects and diseases   would shift the major costs of control to the source and alleviate the   economic burden now borne by homeowners and municipalities.",414,NA,TH,,,,

They are suggested to behave like   ectosymbionts or parasites, impacting their host's health. However, the   species composition of microboring communities, their abundance and   dynamics in live corals under various environmental conditions have   never been explored. Here, the effect of phosphate enrichment on boring   microorganisms in live corals was tested for the first time. Stylophora   pistillata nubbins were exposed to 3 different treatments (phosphate   concentrations of 0, 0.5 and 2.5 mu mol l(-1)) during 15 weeks. After 15   weeks of phosphate enrichment, petrographic thin sections were prepared   for observation with light microscopy, and additional samples were   examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Euendoliths comprised   mainly phototrophic Ostreobium sp. filaments. Rare filaments of   heterotrophic fungi were also observed. Filaments were densely   distributed in the central part of nubbins, and less abundant towards   the apex. Unexpectedly, there was a visible reduction of filament   abundance in the most recently calcified apical part of   phosphate-enriched nubbins. The overall abundance of euendoliths   significantly decreased, from 9.12 +/- 1.09\% of the skeletal surface   area in unenriched corals, to 5.81 +/- 0.77\% and 5.27 +/- 0.34\% in 0.5   and 2.5 mu mol l(-1)-phosphate enriched corals respectively. SEM   observations confirmed this decrease. Recent studies have shown that   phosphate enrichment increases coral skeletal growth and metabolic   rates, while it decreases skeletal density and resilience to mechanical   stress. We thus hypothesize that increased skeletal growth in the   presence of phosphate enrichment occurred too fast for an effective   expansion of euendolith growth. They could not keep up with coral   growth, so they became diluted in the apex areas as nubbins grew with   phosphate enrichment. Results from the present study suggest that coral   skeletons of S. pistillata will not be further weakened by euendoliths   under phosphate enrichment.",416,NA,TH,,,,

These   natural enemies of pest species often need a greater diversity of   resources than the crops themselves provide. In intensive farm   management the numbers of these beneficial arthropod species may be   constrained by a lack of additional prey, floral resources or suitable   overwintering sites. While previous studies have indicated that targeted   field margin management can positively influence the population dynamics   of beneficial insects, the relative contribution of the various   resources provided by these targeted margins remains unclear.   To help optimise field margins for conservation biological control, this   study assessed the relative contribution of three key resources; aphid   prey, floral resources, and grass overwintering sites, in supporting   natural enemies of cereal aphids within an agricultural landscape. Trial   plots were managed adjacent to wheat fields within agro-ecosystems in   the UK to assess the relative importance of these three resources in   isolation and in combination. The abundance of aphidophagous natural   enemies was monitored with respect to these resources during two   periods; prior to cereal aphid infestation in the crop, and during the   infestation period. In addition, the abundance of cereal aphids and   natural enemies was monitored in the crop next to the trial plots during   the infestation period. The results show that resource needs of natural   enemies vary both over time and between natural enemy groups. Some   predators benefited from higher aphid abundance, particularly in   combination with the availability of floral resources. Floral resources   had the greatest individual effect in increasing natural enemy   abundance, both prior to and during periods of aphid infestation. Grassy   overwintering habitat provided little overall benefit during the two   study periods.   In the UK, most non-crop habitat in agro-ecosystems is grass dominated   winter habitat.

Specifically, development   in subterranean brood cells, mass provisioning of resources for the   offspring and the life of social insects in large communities can   enhance the risk of pathogen infestation and/or the spread of disease   among conspecifics.   2. To counteract these threats, insects have evolved mechanical,   chemical and behavioural defences as well as a complex immune system. In   addition to the host's own defences, some Hymenoptera are associated   with protective symbionts. Leaf-cutting ants, solitary digger wasps,   bees and bumblebees engage in symbiotic interactions with bacteria that   protect the adult host, the developing offspring or the food resources   against microbial infections. In the well-studied cases of ants and   wasps, the protective activity is mediated by the production of   antimicrobial secondary metabolites. In other symbiotic interactions,   however, competitive exclusion and immune priming may also play an   important role in enhancing protection. Phylogenetic studies indicate   that the defensive associations in Hymenoptera are generally more   dynamic than the intimate nutritional mutualisms, with horizontal   transfer or de novo uptake of the symbionts from the environment   occurring frequently.   3. Mutualistic micro-organisms can also significantly influence the   outcome of host-parasitoid interactions. Some insects are protected by   symbiont-produced toxins against parasitic wasps. Ichneumonid and   braconid parasitoids, on the other hand, are associated with symbiotic   viruses that are injected into the caterpillar host during oviposition   and suppress its immune system to the advantage of the parasitoid.   4. The increasing affordability of next-generation sequencing   technologies will greatly facilitate the analysis of insect-associated   microbial communities and undoubtedly uncover a plethora of as yet   unknown protective symbioses. However, a detailed understanding of the   host's natural history is indispensable for elucidating the fitness   benefits of the symbionts and the molecular basis of symbiont-conferred   protection.",426,NA,TH,,,,

Location Arctic and subarctic Alaska.   Methods Annual maximum NDVI data from the twice monthly Global Inventory   Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI 1982-2003 data set with   64-km(2) pixels were extracted from a spatial hierarchy including three   large regions: ecoregion polygons within regions, ecozone polygons   within boreal ecoregions and 100-km climate station buffers. The   1982-2003 trends of mean annual maximum NDVI values within each area,   and within individual pixels, were computed using simple linear   regression. The relationship between NDVI and temperature and   precipitation was investigated within climate station buffers.   Results At the largest spatial scale of polar, boreal and maritime   regions, the strongest trend was a negative trend in NDVI within the   boreal region. At a finer scale of ecoregion polygons, there was a   strong positive NDVI trend in cold arctic tundra areas, and a strong   negative trend in interior boreal forest areas. Within boreal ecozone   polygons, the weakest negative trends were from areas with a maritime   climate or colder mountainous ecozones, while the strongest negative   trends were from warmer basin ecozones. The trends from climate station   buffers were similar to ecoregion trends, with no significant trends   from Bering tundra buffers, significant increasing trends among arctic   tundra buffers and significant decreasing trends among interior boreal   forest buffers. The interannual variability of NDVI among the arctic   tundra buffers was related to the previous summer warmth index. The   spatial pattern of increasing tundra NDVI at the pixel level was related   to the west-to-east spatial pattern in changing climate across arctic   Alaska. There was no significant relationship between interannual NDVI   and precipitation or temperature among the boreal forest buffers. The   decreasing NDVI trend in interior boreal forests may be due to several   factors including increased insect/disease infestations, reduced   photosynthesis and a change in root/leaf carbon allocation in response   to warmer and drier growing season climate.   Main conclusion There was a contrast in trends of 1982-2003 annual   maximum NDVI, with cold arctic tundra significantly increasing in NDVI   and relatively warm and dry interior boreal forest areas consistently   decreasing in NDVI. The annual maximum NDVI from arctic tundra areas was   strongly related to a summer warmth index, while there were no   significant relationships in boreal areas between annual maximum NDVI   and precipitation or temperature. Annual maximum NDVI was not related to   spring NDVI in either arctic tundra or boreal buffers.",427,NA,TH,,,,

When an invader tree relies on a fungal mutualism   to survive in the new environment, there is a fundamentally lower   likelihood of either the tree, or the fungus, establishing novel   associations. In contrast, parasitic hitchhikers could merely use their   host plants to move through the landscape and to become established on   new hosts (host shifts). Evidence suggests the frequency of these host   shifts is low and depends upon the fungal functional group.

Invasive plant   species affect ecosystems through numerous avenues, including acting as   ecosystem engineers, contributing unique plant functional traits, and   altering trophic dynamics. We examined the impacts of the invasive weed   Lepidium latifolium on soil-dwelling and canopy-dwelling invertebrate   communities in a brackish marsh of northern California. Invertebrate   abundance, species richness, diversity, and community composition were   measured in both invaded and non-invaded areas of the marsh in four time   periods that correspond with different L. latifolium phenologic phases.   We observed these different stages of L. latifolium, and we recorded   alterations in the habitat structure provided by L. latifolium as the   plant entered senescence. L. latifolium had differential impacts on the   two invertebrate communities studied. The presence of L. latifolium   increased abundance of soil-dwelling invertebrates and decreased the   species richness of canopy-dwelling invertebrates in the tidal   marsh-terrestrial ecotone where L. latifolium ameliorates harsh physical   conditions. No changes occurred in the tidal marsh plain and fringing   tidal marsh where L. latifolium's physical structure is more similar to   existing non-L. latifolium structure. During full senescence, L.   latifolium reduced canopy-dwelling invertebrate abundance and altered   trophic dynamics, shifting composition to a predator-dominated   community. Our results demonstrate that L. latifolium can impact   brackish marsh ecosystems, and we hypothesize L. latifolium's unique   functional traits (large inflorescence and seasonal senescence) enable   it to act as an ecosystem engineer that alters community and trophic   dynamics. Mechanisms through which plant invaders alter ecosystem   processes are dynamic in space and time, thus, future research will   require the use of manipulative experiments to inform site-specific   management strategies.",429,NA,TH,,,,

However, the question is how uniform these   responses are across contrasting life forms. Here, we test the   hypothesis that life form matters for effects on soil and plant-soil   feedback. In a meta-analysis we show that exotics enhanced C cycling,   numbers of meso-invertebrates and nematodes, while having variable   effects on other soil biota and processes. Plant effects on soil biota   and processes were not dependent on life form, but patterns in feedback   effects of natives and exotics were dependent on life form. Native   grasses and forbs caused changes in soil that subsequently negatively   affected their biomass, whereas native trees caused changes in soil that   subsequently positively affected their biomass. Most exotics had neutral   feedback effects, although exotic forbs had positive feedback effects.   Effects of exotics on natives differed among plant life forms. Native   trees were inhibited in soils conditioned by exotics, whereas native   grasses were positively influenced in soil conditioned by exotics.

In this study, different configurations of auxiliary   units are investigated to partially or totally meet the energy   requirements for MEA post-combustion capture in a 500 MW sub-critical   coal-fired plant. The auxiliary unit is either a boiler, providing only   the heat required for solvent regeneration in the capture process or a   combined heat and power (CHP) unit, providing both heat and electricity.   Using biomass in auxiliary units, the grid loss is reduced without   increasing fossil fuel consumption. The results show that using a   biomass CHP unit is more favourable than using a biomass boiler both in   terms of CO2 emission reductions and power plant economic viability. By   using an auxiliary biomass CHP unit, both the emission intensity and the   cost of electricity would be marginally lower than for a coal plant with   capture.

These were later collapsed into two broad directions,   ` looking out' (the economic rewards generated by a full application of   free market policies with rangeland enterprises having strong external   linkages will result in production and management efficiencies which   benefit the Australian economy) and `looking in' (rangeland Australia   and its human, economic and ecological resources will be best served by   the development and maintenance of strong local communities in each   rangeland region). It was anticipated that ` looking out' would apply to   only a few rangeland regions where pastoral production is highly valued   and rangelands are resilient; ` looking in' would apply to the majority   of the rangelands where other values might outweigh pastoral production   in the future and where the rangeland resource is considered less   resilient.   Given the world's embrace of economic and trade globalisation, and the   dominance in the federal sphere of one coalition government and one   prime minister, it seems inevitable that across Australia the last 10   years were dominated by the ` looking out' direction, while many   marginal rangelands had few options but to `look in'. The 1996   discussions failed to appreciate fully the importance in shaping today's   world of singular issues such as terrorism, global climate change,   potential disease pandemics, the emergence of China and India and, in an   Australian rangelands context, the continuing success of the northern   beef industry. In the interim, rangelands science has produced an   impressive underpinning of integrative information led both by industry   investment and government funding. However, long-term resilience is   still not assured in many areas of Australia's rangelands.

During the next 2 decades the rangelands will be buffeted by   many of the same old issues and well as obvious emerging ones. Important   human-centric ones will be the tension between European and Aboriginal   demographic trends, the increased economic dominance of mining, tourism   and defence in the rangelands, and the `sponge effect' of successful   towns and particular enterprises. Ecological and bio-physical issues   will include carbon trading, energy generation, water catchments, weeds   and diseases and agricultural incursions into the northern rangelands.   The broad directions of `looking out' and `looking in' still retain some   currency for today's rangeland decision makers but are now embedded in   far stronger and shifting currents that are frequently determined by   global and national dynamics, rather than local issues. A distinguishing   feature of the Australian rangelands is that they are still essentially   intact (apart from their fauna) in a world context and may gain future   ecological and economic advantage by remaining so.

For Columbia spotted frogs (Rana   luteiventris) in the Great Basin (USA), a genetically distinct   population segment of conservation concern, we approached this problem   by examining (1) landscape-scale habitat availability and distribution,   (2) water body-scale habitat associations, and (3) resource   management-identified threats to persistence. We found that areas with   perennial aquatic habitat and suitable climate are extremely limited in   the southern portion of the species' range. Within these suitable areas,   native and non-native predators (trout and American bullfrogs   [Lithobates catesbeianus]) are widespread and may further limit   habitat availability in upper- and lower-elevation areas, respectively.   At the water body scale, spotted frog occupancy was associated with   deeper sites containing abundant emergent vegetation and nontrout fish   species. Streams with American beaver (Castor canadensis) frequently had   these structural characteristics and were significantly more likely to   be occupied than ponds, lakes, streams without beaver, or streams with   inactive beaver ponds, highlighting the importance of active   manipulation of stream environments by beaver. Native and non-native   trout reduced the likelihood of spotted frog occupancy, especially where   emergent vegetation cover was sparse. Intensive livestock grazing, low   aquatic connectivity, and ephemeral hydroperiods were also negatively   associated with spotted frog occupancy. We conclude that persistence of   this species at the arid end of its range has been largely facilitated   by habitat stability (i.e., permanent hydroperiod), connectivity,   predator-free refugia, and a commensalistic interaction with an   ecosystem engineer. Beaver-induced changes to habitat quality,   stability, and connectivity may increase spotted frog population   resistance and resilience to seasonal drought, grazing, non-native   predators, and climate change, factors which threaten local or regional   persistence.",440,NA,TH,,,,

We   combined field experiments and population surveys to investigate how   endophyte infection and associated alkaloids influence abundances,   species richness, evenness and guild structure of arthropod communities   on a native grass, Achnatherum robustum (sleepygrass). Surprisingly, we   found that endophyte-produced alkaloids were associated with increased   herbivore abundances and species richness.

American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was an abundant tree   species in North America until its decimation by introduced chestnut   blight. To restore chestnut in North America, efforts are ongoing to   test putative blight-resistant hybrids of Castanea dentata and Chinese   chestnut (Castanea mollissima), but little is known about the ecology of   C. mollissima. In a forest in northeastern USA in which C. mollissima   has become established, we explored questions of stand dynamics, health   and genetic relationships of C. mollissima offspring to an adjacent   parent orchard. We found that C. mollissima was adapted and randomly   distributed among native species in this relatively young forest. The   genetics of the C. mollissima population compared with its parents   indicated little effect of selection pressure as each of the parent   trees contributed at least one offspring. The ease with which this   exotic species proliferated calls to question why C. mollissima is rare   elsewhere in forests of North America. It is likely that a time window   of low animal predation allowed seedlings to establish, and the shallow   soil at this site limited the maximum forest canopy height, permitting   the characteristically short-statured C. mollissima to avoid   suppression. Our results indicate that because C. mollissima exhibited   pioneer species characteristics, hybrids between C. mollissima and C.   dentata have the potential to be successful pioneer species of future   forests in North America, and we challenge the paradigm that exotic tree   species are wholly detrimental to native biodiversity.

We found that varying plant   genotypic diversity and watering treatment altered multivariate   arthropod community composition and structure. Arthropod biodiversity   and richness showed a distinct response to the plant diversity x   watering treatment interaction, declining sharply in water-limited   genotypic mixtures.

Effects of invasive species on ecosystem processes are often thought   to underlie the effects of invaders on community dynamics. Specifically,   positive feedbacks in which invasive species alter ecosystem function in   ways that favour their own growth have been suggested as an important   mechanism contributing to the success of invasion.   2. In this study, we analysed the impacts of the invasive exotic tree   Acer platanoides on survival and growth of conspecific and native tree   seedlings, and explored whether these impacts can be explained by the   ecosystem effects of the invader. Seedlings of Acer platanoides, Acer   saccharum, Fraxinus americana and Prunus serotina were monitored in   quadrats in three forest stands in northwestern Connecticut. Soil   resources and light levels were quantified in the same quadrats.   3. Maximum-likelihood methods were used to predict seedling survival and   growth as a function of the size and spatial configuration of A.   platanoides trees in the immediate neighbourhood (0-25 m).   4. The abundance of A. platanoides in the neighbourhood had moderate   negative effects on survival of first-year conspecific seedlings, but   did not affect survival of older conspecific or native seedlings. These   negative effects on conspecifics were not correlated with soil nutrients   or light levels, but were presumably related to Janzen-Connell effects.   In contrast, A. platanoides had strong positive effects on the growth of   seedlings of all four species. These positive effects appear to be   related to the positive impacts of the invader on soil fertility.   5. Our results support the importance of canopy-seedling feedbacks as a   mechanism regulating the rate of invasion in forests. However, they also   indicate that the net consequences of feedbacks on the process of   invasion are probably determined by the balance of positive and negative   feedbacks acting at the same time on different aspects of regeneration   (i.e. survival vs. growth).   6. Synthesis. Because the species with the highest inherent growth rates   were the most responsive to the `fertilizing' effect of A. platanoides,   we conclude that the invasion of north-eastern forests by this exotic   tree may facilitate canopy dominance by fast-growing native and exotic   species associated with fertile soils.",445,NA,TH,,,,

Hence, assessing the effects of such anthropogenic   disturbances on multi-species interactions may be essential to improve   adaptation and mitigation measures for biodiversity conservation. We   determined the importance of edge effects on the interaction and   distribution of three keystone species in South American temperate rain   forests: the hemiparasitic mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus, its main host   (the liana Campsidium valdivianum) and its only seed disperser (the   marsupial Dromiciops gliroides). The discordant impacts of forest edges   on host (positive) and seed disperser (negative) affected mistletoe   distribution at large spatial scales, owing to the combined effects of   increased dispersal limitation and decreased host availability. More   importantly, marsupial abundance had contrasting effects on mistletoe   abundance at small and large spatial scales - suggesting a potential   trade-off between local and long-distance dispersal. We found the number   of adult mistletoes per host increased with host size, which likely   indicates that mistletoe colonization accumulated over the host's   lifespan. However, the number of juveniles found per host peaked at   medium-sized hosts, increased with marsupial abundance and host   availability and showed a negligible response to edges.Synthesis. The   lack of spatial congruence between host and seed disperser probably   explains the scarcity of mistletoes in the study area, although the   discordant drivers of juvenile and adult distributions suggest that   there is a trade-off between recruitment patterns but also potential   dispersal limitation at small scales. In essence, the interdependence   amongst species linked by (mutualistic and antagonistic) interactions   makes them more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, exacerbating its   impact on the diversity and functioning of forest ecosystems.",446,NA,TH,,,,

In view of the increasingly   unpredictable flow rates in streams and rivers, this study aimed to   assess the combined effect of flow condition and parasitism on the   shoaling behaviour of a model fish species. Shoal size, shoal cohesion   and time spent shoaling of female guppies Poecilia reticulata were   compared when infected with the directly transmitted ectoparasite   Gyrodactylus turnbulli under flow and static conditions. Flow condition   was an important factor in influencing shoaling behaviour of guppies   with the fish forming larger shoals in the absence of flow. When a shoal   member was infected with G. turnbulli, shoal cohesion was reduced, but   the magnitude of this effect was dependent on flow condition. In both   flow and static conditions, bigger fish formed larger shoals than   smaller counterparts. Future changes to stream hydrology with more   frequent flooding and drought events will affect the shoaling tendency   of fish. During high-flow events, diseased fish may not be able to keep   up with shoal mates and therefore have a higher risk of predation.   Additionally, these findings may be important for aquaria and farmed   species where an increase in flow rate may reduce aggregation in fish.",449,NA,TH,,,,

We examined the relationship between intraspecific diversity   and yield in cultivar mixtures using a meta-analysis of 91 studies and   >3,600 observations. Additionally, we investigated how environmental and   management factors might influence this relationship, and if the yield   stability of cultivar mixtures differed from that of monocultures. We   found that the yield increased by 2.2\% overall in cultivar mixtures   relative to their monoculture components. Mixtures with more cultivars   and those with more functional trait diversity showed higher relative   yields. Under biotic stressors, such as disease pressure, and abiotic   stressors, such as low levels of soil organic matter and nutrient   availability, this diversity effect was stronger, resulting in higher   relative yields. Finally, cultivar mixtures generally showed higher   yield stability compared to monocultures, especially in response to   annual weather variability at a site over time. This practice of mixing   cultivars can be integrated into intensified cropping systems where   species monocultures dominate, as well as in smallholder cropping   systems where low-cost improvements are in demand.

We demonstrated that   the manure release parameters could be estimated more reliably when the   model fit was performed using data for different manure components   pooled together, while the model fit to a single release curve produced   correlated parameters. The model parameters appeared to be robust and   transferable from the calibration to validation datasets without any or   with only minor losses of the model accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

At the time discharge began, these   wetlands had been isolated from virtually all freshwater inflow from the   surrounding watershed for over a half century, due primarily to the   construction of canals and spoil banks. Immediately following effluent   discharge in 2006, there was robust growth of herbaceous vegetation. By   late fall 2007, the emergent wetlands in the immediate vicinity of the   effluent discharge began to decline, and within months nearly the entire   marsh south of the discharge pipe had converted to open water or   mudflat. By 2010, there had been substantial recovery of the marsh. A   number of hypotheses have been presented to explain the degradation of   the marsh to open water and mudflats, including herbivory by the   introduced rodent nutria (Myocastor coypus), excessive nutrients,   reductions in above-and belowground biomass, increased soil   decomposition due to high nutrients, prolonged inundation, toxicity,   increased pH, and disease. Intensive field and mesocosm studies provide   conclusive data that the marsh loss was primarily caused by nutria   herbivory, and secondarily by waterfowl herbivory, and that recovery of   the herbaceous vegetation occurred as a result of aggressive nutria   control (>2000 eliminated). Marsh recovery has been most intensive near   the point of discharge. Mature baldcypress growing in the area of   discharge had growth rates that were five times those of trees not   receiving effluent in the lower Joyce area and Maurepas swamp. Field and   mesocosm studies show that nutrients increased both above-and   belowground biomass and did not increase decomposition rates of   herbaceous vegetation. Increased flooding due to lack of drainage from   the area is hindering marsh recovery. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier   B.V.",460,NA,TH,,,,

However, associated costs in terms of reduced, self-regulation and   increased reliance on external inputs for the control of pests, diseases   and weeds are seldom taken into account or acknowledged. A pro-active   approach in which ecosystems services are documented and potential   effects of changes in agricultural practices evaluated may lead to more   informed decisions prior to implementation.   We investigated the effects of management of cereal production in a   semi-arid region on weed seed mortality caused by predators. Seed losses   have a greater impact on weed population size than any other life cycle   process and should therefore be of significance for natural weed   control. We hypothesized that the conversion from rain-fed to irrigated   production should lead to reduced and the adoption of no-till techniques   to increased seed predation.   Seed removal and seed predator populations were monitored in irrigated   (N = 3) and rain-fed cereal fields (N = 6) and field margins. Of the   dryland fields half was conventionally tilled and the other half   no-till. Seed removal (g g(-1) 2-days(-1)) was followed from April 2007   until June 2008, using Petri-dishes and exclosure cages. Populations of   harvester ants were estimated by direct nest counts; rodent populations   by Sherman live traps.   Seed removal in dryland cereals, mainly by harvester ants Messor   barbarus was high from mid April to mid October, and should cause a   strong weed suppressive effect. Seed removal in irrigated cereals,   mainly by granivorous rodents Mus spretus, was low.   Seed removal was higher in no-till than in conventional fields and   corresponded to differences in harvester ant nest densities.   Synthesis and applications. Our results show that tillage and irrigation   in a semi-arid cereal production system results in a reduction and total   annihilation of granivorous harvester ants, respectively. The concurrent   decline in weed seed mortality could lead to increased herbicide use and   dependency. In particular, in areas where economic margins are small or   the environmental costs of tillage and irrigation high, the increased   costs of chemical weed control may exceed the benefits.

Addressing these   questions is particularly important for Streptococcus pneumoniae, a   nasopharyngeal commensal and respiratory pathogen, because the changes   in population structure associated with the recent introduction of   partial-coverage vaccines have substantially reduced pneumococcal   disease. Here we show that pneumococcal lineages from multiple   populations each have a distinct combination of intermediate-frequency   genes. Functional analysis suggested that these loci may be subject to   negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) through interactions with   other bacteria, hosts or mobile elements. Correspondingly, these genes   had similar frequencies in four populations with dissimilar lineage   compositions. These frequencies were maintained following substantial   alterations in lineage prevalences once vaccination programmes began.   Fitting a multilocus NFDS model of post-vaccine population dynamics to   three genomic datasets using Approximate Bayesian Computation generated   reproducible estimates of the influence of NFDS on pneumococcal   evolution, the strength of which varied between loci.

However, there is also conflict between mutualists,   because their interests are not perfectly aligned. In addition, most   mutualisms are exploited by parasites. Here, we study the interplay   between cooperation, conflict and parasitism in the mutualism between   fig trees and their pollinator wasps. Conflict occurs because each fig   ovary can nurture either one seed or one pollinator offspring and, while   fig trees benefit directly from seeds and pollinator offspring (pollen   vectors), pollinators only benefit directly from pollinator offspring.   The mechanism(s) of conflict resolution is debated, but must explain the   widespread observation that pollinators develop in inner, and seeds in   outer, layers of fig flowers. We recently suggested a role for   non-pollinating figs wasps (NPFWs) that are natural enemies or   competitors of the pollinators and lay their eggs through the fig wall.   Most NPFW offspring develop in outer and middle layer flowers,   suggesting that inner flowers provide enemy-free space for pollinator   offspring. Here, we test the hypothesis that NPFWs cannot reach inner   flowers, by measuring wasp and fig morphology at the species-specific   times of NPFW attack in the field. We found that three species of   Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps that parasitise pollinators could   reach 3473\%, 7592\% and 8297\% of fig ovaries, respectively. Meanwhile,   Eukobelea and Pseudidarnes gall-formers, despite having shorter   ovipositors, can access almost all fig flowers (9399\% and 100\%),   because they attack smaller (younger) fig fruits. Our mechanistic   results from ovipositing wasps support spatial patterns of wasp   offspring segregation within figs to suggest that inner ovules provide   enemy-free-space for pollinators. This may contribute to mutualism   stability by helping select for pollinators to avoid laying eggs where   they are likely to be parasitised. These outer flowers then remain free   to develop as seeds, promoting mutualism persistence.",463,NA,TH,,,,

For mosquitoes, existing spatial models use only habitat elements   (hydrologic and floristic) to predict the distribution of disease   vectors within the landscape, ignoring the potential importance of the   distribution of hosts. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of   hosts would better explain the spatial distribution of mosquitoes than   habitat variables using Information Theory and Poisson Regression. We   analyzed the abundance of ectotherm-biting mosquitoes and their hosts   from 37 points over a 28-km(2) area in Tuskegee National Forest,   Alabama, USA. We compared models built using information regarding   habitat, hosts, or both for their ability to explain the abundance of   Culex peccator and Culex territans, two mosquito species that specialize   on reptiles and amphibians. Models built using both host and habitat   information were the best models for both species, suggesting that   information regarding the distribution of mosquito hosts greatly   improves models of mosquito distributions. Moreover, when differences in   habitat makeup among stations were accounted for, mosquitoes were found   to be significantly more abundant at locations with greater host   abundance. Since most mosquitoes feed on only a limited range of hosts   and successful blood feeding is one of the most crucial bottlenecks in   the life cycle of mosquitoes, it follows that mosquitoes would aggregate   in areas of greatest host density. Habitat influences the availability   of suitable larval development sites, and to some extent, distribution   of hosts. Our analysis, however, shows that within the landscape the   distribution of host animals is a crucial factor in determining the   spatial distribution of vectors. This has clear and important   implications for determining which areas are at a greater risk for   zoonotic arboviruses and is a potentially transformative paradigm for   understanding the factors that influence the spatial distribution of   disease vectors.",464,NA,TH,,,,

However, the importance of plant-soil feedback in   historical contingency processes and plant community dynamics is largely   unknown. In microcosms, we tested how six early-successional plant   species of secondary succession on ex-arable land induced plant-specific   changes in soil community composition. Following one growth cycle of   conditioning the soil community, soil feedback effects were assessed as   plant performance in soil of their own as compared to soil from a   mixture of the other five early-successional species. Performance was   tested in monocultures and in mixed communities with heterospecific   competition from mid-successional species. The role of soil   microorganisms was determined by isolating the microbial component from   the soil community, re-inoculating microorganisms into sterilized   substrate, and analyzing plant biomass responses of the early-and   mid-successional species. Plant-soil feedback responses of the   early-successional species were negative and significantly increased   when the plants were grown in a competitive environment with he tero   specifics. In monocultures, three early-successional species experienced   negative feedback in soil with a history of conspecifics, while all   early-successional species experienced negative feedback when grown with   interspecific competition. Interestingly, the normative forb Conyza   canadensis showed the weakest soil feedback effect. Biomass production   of the early-successional plant species was profoundly reduced by the   microbial inocula, most strongly when exposed to inocula of conspecific   origin. Molecular characterization of the fungal and bacterial   rhizosphere communities revealed a relationship between plant biomass   production and the composition of the dominant fungal species.   Furthermore, our results show that, in early secondary succession, the   early-successional plant species induce changes in the soil microbial   community composition that cause historical contingency effects in   dominance patterns of mid-succession plant communities. We conclude that   feedback between early-successional plant species and soil   microorganisms can play a crucial role in breaking dominance of   early-successional plant communities. Moreover the influences on soil   microorganism community composition influenced plant community dynamics   in the mid-successional plant communities.

We tested the hypothesis that the fecundity of a pro-ovigenic parasitoid   (where females emerge with their full egg load) should be positively   correlated with the mean expectation for oviposition opportunities in   the environment. More specifically, we tested whether females from   agricultural systems, where hosts are often relatively abundant, emerge   with more eggs than those from natural habitats.   We studied the pro-ovigenic parasitoid wasp Anagrus daanei, which   parasitizes eggs of leafhoppers of the genus Erythroneura. Erythroneura   spp. leafhoppers feed on Vitis spp. (grapes) and are major pests of   commercial vineyards as well as common herbivores of wild Vitis   californica, which grows in riparian habitats. We sampled leafhoppers   and parasitoids from eight vineyards and eight riparian habitats in   central California.   We found that leafhopper density was higher at vineyards than in   riparian habitats, whereas leafhopper egg volume and parasitoid body   size did not differ among these habitat types. Parasitoids from   vineyards had higher egg loads than parasitoids from wild grapes, and   fecundity was positively related to host density across field sites.   Parasitoid egg volume was larger in natural sites; however, this   variation was not significantly correlated with host density across   field sites. Within a single population of parasitoids collected from a   vineyard, parasitoid egg load was negatively correlated with longevity,   suggesting a trade-off between reproduction and life span.   The results may be explained by a rapid evolution of reproductive traits   in response to oviposition opportunities; or alternatively, by the   occurrence of maternal effects on the fecundity of daughters based on   the foraging experience of their mothers.   The ability of parasitoid fecundity to track mean host availability is   likely to modulate the likelihood that parasitoid fitness will be   constrained by a shortage of eggs and strengthen the ability of   parasitoids to suppress the population densities of their hosts.",468,NA,TH,,,,

The model that best   explained the variation in biting activity rate included the capture   time, environmental humidity, air temperature, sunshine degree and wind   speed as predictor variables. Host-seeking activity was higher in the   evening than in the morning or afternoon, and it was positively related   to mean air temperature and environmental relative humidity (RH), but   negatively to sunshine degree and wind speed.

This is   concerning, as seagrass beds provide numerous ecosystem services.   Although nutrient loading can result in eutrophication and mass   mortality of seagrasses, it more often results in subtle alterations of   abiotic conditions which, by themselves, are insufficient to drive   widespread seagrass mortality. Here we used a month-long field-based   experiment to test the influence of anthropogenic nutrient loading on   the outcome of an interaction between an epizootic sponge (Halichondria   melanadocia) and a seagrass (Thalassia testudinum). Using a factorial   design we manipulated ambient nutrient concentrations by adding   fertilizer to plots with and without a sponge in a relatively pristine   seagrass bed on Abaco Island, The Bahamas. We measured seagrass growth,   below- and above-ground biomass, and the change in shoot density. We   found that low levels of nutrient loading (i.e., insufficient to cause   increased algal growth and decreased oxygen levels associated with   eutrophication) resulted in a non-significant increase in seagrass   growth, biomass, and shoot density when a sponge was absent. When a   sponge was present, the same level of fertilization resulted in a   significant reduction in the response variables. Our results show that   anthropogenic nutrient loading can shift the sponge-seagrass interaction   away from commensalism toward an interaction that has negative   consequences for the seagrass. Additionally, a shift in the outcome of   this context-dependent interaction can alter the impact of nutrient   loading on seagrass productivity. Our study provides an example of how   simple classifications of interspecific interactions (e.g.,   commensalism) often mask underlying variability. Characterizing the   mechanisms driving the variability will allow us to understand when and   how the outcome of an interaction will change.

Guidelines for the timing and spatial extent of control   measures for pathogen invasions are currently limited, however. We   conducted a field experiment using wheat (Triticum aestivum) stripe   rust, caused by the wind-dispersed fungus puccinia striiformis, to study   the extent to which host heterogeneity in an initial outbreak focus   influences subsequent disease spread. We varied the frequency of   susceptible host plants in an initial outbreak focus and in the   non-focus of experimental plots, and observed the progress of epidemics   produced by artificial inoculation. The frequency of susceptible hosts   in the initial outbreak focus increased the spread of stripe rust in the   experimental plots, while frequency of susceptible hosts outside the   initial outbreak focus did not. This suggests that factors influencing   pathogen reproduction in the initial outbreak focus are key to the   control of epidemics of stripe rust. Two mechanisms may underlie the   field results. The first is the continuing, direct infection of   susceptible hosts in areas outside the initial outbreak focus by disease   propagules arriving from the initial outbreak focus. The second is   highly local proliferation of disease caused by direct descendants of   colonizing individuals originating from the initial outbreak focus. We   considered these two alternatives in simulations of a generalized   pathogen exhibiting fat-tailed dispersal, similar to P. striiformis.   Simulations showed a dominant effect of conditions in the initial   outbreak focus, in agreement with the field experiment, but indicated   that, over time, this dominance may erode. Analysis of the duration of   focal dominance led to the conclusion that both mechanisms contribute to   the phenomenon of focal dominance, and that the frequency of susceptible   hosts in the initial outbreak focus had a stronger influence when the   proportion of propagules that remained local during dispersal was   higher.

We included in our analyses hazards present throughout the   translocation pathway derived from the interactions between host   immunity and the parasite, the effect of parasites on populations, the   effect of noninfectious disease agents, and the effect of stressors on   hostparasite interactions. We used the reintroduction of Eurasian Cranes   (Grus grus) to England to demonstrate our method. Of the 24 hazards   identified, 1 was classified as high risk (coccidia) and 5 were medium   risk (highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, Mycobacterium avium,   Aspergillus fumigatus, tracheal worms [Syngamus sp. and Cyathostoma   sp.], and Tetrameres spp.). Seventeen other hazards were considered low   or very low risk. In the absence of better information on the number,   identity, distribution, and pathogenicity of parasites of wild animals,   there is uncertainty in the risk of disease to translocated animals and   recipient populations. Surveys of parasites in source and destination   populations and detailed health monitoring after release will improve   the information available for future analyses of disease risk. We   believe our method can be adapted to assess the risks of disease in   other translocated populations.",476,NA,TH,,,,

However, the Coquimbo Region   presents a broad ecological transition from the hyperarid Atacama Desert   to the north, and the more mesic Chilean Mediterranean region of central   Chile, resulting in relatively high species diversity. Approximately 130   species are found here, 8 of which are endemic to Chile although not to   this region. Bosque Fray Jorge National Park is a 9959 ha Biosphere   Reserve dominated by matorral habitat and hosting up to 123 bird   species. Through avian surveys and banding over nearly a decade we have   documented 63 terrestrial species and discerned predictable seasonal and   interannual structure to avian assemblages, at least through an extended   dry period. Recent studies in the matorral habitats of the park indicate   seasonal patterns that fall into 4 patterns: year-round residents,   winter visitors, summer breeders, and transients. Short-term banding   studies demonstrate cooccurring wintering and breeding cohorts among   species of Sierra-finches (Phrygilus) in the park; such assemblages and   dynamics are reminiscent of North American Mediterranean avian   assemblages and pose interesting ecological comparisons. In this period   of surveys there appears to have been a gradual transition of the   avifauna that may be a response to anthropogenic influence and/or   climate change. Research on the foraging behavior of 2 insectivorous   species indicate that one of these is convergent on better-known North   American taxa while the other clearly is not; these efforts suggest   useful avenues for further comparative research. A remarkable   coevolutionary association between the Chilean Mockingbird (Mimus   thence) and endoparasitic mistletoes (Tristerix) provides insight into   potential convergent ecologies in desert regions with different   evolutionary histories.   Less than 1\% of the park comprises temperate forest remnants that   subsist due to extensive water input from fog. Research in these   remnants has emphasized the role of habitat fragmentation on avian   assemblage composition and on reproductive ecology by forest-dependent   species. The avifauna here comprises a subset of that found in intact   Valdivian rainforest to the south, and forest remnant size alone   explains over 90\% of the variation in species numbers. One species has   been particularly well studied; the Thorn-tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura   spinicauda) is more abundant and has higher nestling survival in larger   fragments. We summarize other work on stress responses and variation in   song structure in this species. Finally, the role of birds in tree   recruitment here has important implications in the face of a recent   history of reduction in sizes of forest remnants; numerous birds consume   the fruit of the dominant tree, olivillo (Aextoxicon punctatum), but   they fail to promote successful recruitment because they defecate viable   seeds in locations that provide poor survival of seedlings.   Ornithological research in Chile is undergoing a modest renaissance, and   while dryland avifaunas are characterized more by what is not known and   has yet to be studied than by actual ecological understanding, they   provide a baseline for many exciting studies ranging from natural   history to the role of migration to comparative dynamics of independent   lineages in North and South America.

This lack   of diversity may increase risks of ecological and economic disruptions.   Centuries of intense fishing have extirpated most apex predators in the   Gulf of Maine (United States and Canada), effectively creating an   American lobster (Homarus americanus) monoculture. Over the past 20   years, the economic diversity of marine resources harvested in Maine has   declined by almost 70\%. Today, over 80\% of the value of Maine's fish   and seafood landings is from highly abundant lobsters.   Inflation-corrected income from lobsters in Maine has steadily increased   by nearly 400\% since 1985. Fisheries managers, policy makers, and   fishers view this as a success. However, such lucrative monocultures   increase the social and ecological consequences of future declines in   lobsters. In southern New England, disease and stresses related to   increases in ocean temperature resulted in more than a 70\% decline in   lobster abundance, prompting managers to propose closing that fishery. A   similar collapse in Maine could fundamentally disrupt the social and   economic foundation of its coast. We suggest the current success of   Maine's lobster fishery is a gilded trap. Gilded traps are a type of   social trap in which collective actions resulting from economically   attractive opportunities outweigh concerns over associated social and   ecological risks or consequences. Large financial gain creates a strong   reinforcing feedback that deepens the trap. Avoiding or escaping gilded   traps requires managing for increased biological and economic diversity.   This is difficult to do prior to a crisis while financial incentives for   maintaining the status quo are large.

We studied the spatial heterogeneity of the soil   around the palm by measuring comprehensive soil quality in a 24-year-old   oil palm plantation. Soil quality and litter were assessed in five zones   with different plant cover, and different applications of herbicide or   fertilizer. Physical-chemical characteristics, macrofauna, and   nematofauna were analysed. A sampling method was developed and adapted   to the way the cultivation practices are implemented: sampling by zone   and weighting the plot mean by the respective area of each zone. The   total density of macrofauna in the litter and in the 0-15 cm soil layer   followed a gradient from the harvest pathway (29 ind m(-2)) to the   windrow (1003 ind m(-2)).

Because   such effects can affect infection positively or negatively,   understanding the net effects of predation on pathogen transmission   under natural conditions is important.   We conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine the effects of predators   on interactions between tadpole hosts (Pseudacris regilla) and trematode   parasites (Ribeiroia ondatrae). We manipulated the presence of   (non-lethal, i.e., caged) predators of tadpoles (dragonfly larvae) and   (potentially lethal) parasite predators (damselfly larvae) to evaluate   their individual and combined effects on host infection. We expected   that dragonflies would reduce tadpole activity and thereby increase   parasite infection through a reduction in antiparasite behaviour.   Because damselflies can consume parasites in the laboratory, we   predicted that damselflies would lower infection by consuming parasites   before they infected tadpoles. Our goal was to evaluate the net   consequences of these predator-mediated effects for host/prey infection.   The presence of caged dragonflies reduced tadpole activity, resulting in   a similar to 50\% increase in average infection load compared to   treatments without predators. In contrast to our prediction that   damselflies would reduce infection, damselflies elicited behavioural and   morphological changes in hosts similar to dragonflies, with a comparable   increase in parasite transmission. Thus, predator-mediated effects were   evident predominantly through changes in host/prey behaviour, rather   than through changes in the abundance of parasites. The lack of a direct   effect of predators on infection (i.e. via consumption of parasites)   could be the result of the presence of alternative prey (zooplankton) or   a mismatch in timing between visual predators feeding during the day and   parasites released from the first intermediate host and infecting   amphibians at night.   The presence of predators also stimulated morphological defences in   their tadpole prey, including increased tail and body depth.   Interestingly, we found that parasite infection also induced   morphological changes in tadpole tail and body depth, similar to changes   produced by (non-lethal) cues from predators. Parasites caused   malformations in tadpoles, but there were no effects on tadpole growth   or development from either parasites or predators.   This research has key implications for linking predation and infectious   disease in aquatic ecosystems. Our results emphasise the importance of   indirect effects of predators on infection and highlight possible   trade-offs in mitigating the concurrent risks of predation and disease.   Parasites can also alter host morphology through trait-mediated effects   similar to predators, supporting a broader inclusion of parasites in the   study of the ecology of natural enemies.",484,NA,TH,,,,

Foodwebs are at the core of ecosystem models, but because   dietary data can be difficult to obtain, they are often coarsely   characterised.

Both COX1   Minibar and 16S Chord-cephA barcodes provided higher taxonomic   resolution than morphological analysis, but the resolution varied   between taxonomic groups primarily due to availabilities of reference   data.

Many of these grasslands have lost   their diversity due to agricultural intensification. A new tool to   facilitate restoration is to introduce hemiparasitic plants such as   Rhinanthus species. R. minor accelerates restoration by decreasing the   biomass of competitive plants and creating gaps which benefit colonising   species. Questions remain about the generality of these impacts and   whether R. minor can establish and facilitate community change in more   productive grasslands. We addressed these questions by introducing R.   minor into 13 mesotrophic grassland sites in southern England. These   represented four main soil types and different ages of grasslands (eight   permanent grasslands and five temporary ex-arable grasslands). We   investigated two treatments using a factorial design: +/- Rhinanthus   seed addition and +/- soil surface scarification. Rhinanthus populations   established at all but one site. There was high variation in   establishment success between the sites (range 0\% to 25\%), but   productivity of the site or nutrient level did not affect establishment.   However, scarification improved establishment. Rhinanthus decreased host   (mainly grasses and legumes) biomass by between 27 and 37\%.   Scarification also decreased grass, legume, total and host biomass.   There was a strong negative relationship between the abundance of   hemiparasites and grass biomass. Non-leguminous herbs were not affected   by the treatments, but grassland age had an effect as there were more   herbs in permanent grasslands. The results show that it is possible to   establish Rhinanthus into different mesotrophic grassland communities   representing a variety of soil types and ages, suggesting it is a   practical and widely applicable tool for restoration. The considerable   variation in the rate of Rhinanthus establishment is unexplained.

To make these connections, we used lab   experiments and theoretical models that link feeding with   susceptibility, energetics, and fecundity of hosts. These feeding-based   mechanisms also produced a fecundity-survivorship trade-off. Meanwhile,   a parasite spore yield-fecundity trade-off arose from variation in   juvenile growth rate among host clones (another index of resource use),   a result that was readily anticipated and explained by the models.

Insect herbivores are generally more abundant in agro-ecosystems than   in natural ecosystems. One possible cause is that artificial selection   of crop plants may have disrupted parasitoid-herbivore interactions. We   studied a native tritrophic system to determine if crop domestication   has created a refuge for the sunflower moth Homoeosoma electellum from   its major parasitoid Dolichogenidea homoeosomae.   2. Parasitoid foraging behaviour on infested wild and agricultural   sunflowers was studied using event-recording software. We used detailed   observations on larval feeding location and parasitoid probing behaviour   to determine if the lower parasitism on agricultural sunflowers was the   result of a structural refuge or a change in parasitoid foraging   behaviour.   3. Greater than 20 times more larvae fed on seeds of agricultural   sunflowers than on seeds of wild sunflowers. Seed-feeding enabled larvae   to escape parasitoids because their ovipositors were too weak to   penetrate the seed. As a consequence, larvae were more likely to be   parasitized on wild sunflowers than on agricultural sunflowers, and   floret-feeding larvae were more likely to be parasitized than   seed-feeding larvae.   4. Parasitoids were more stimulated to probe for larvae on wild   sunflowers than on agricultural sunflowers. However, they responded to   larval feeding location rather than plant genotype. Thus lower   parasitism on agricultural sunflowers was due to a structural refuge for   larvae rather than a change in parasitoid foraging behaviour.   5. Synthesis and applications. Crop domestication has created a   structural refuge from parasitism. The presence of refuges on   agricultural plants helps explain why some insects are difficult to   regulate using biological control. Studying parasitoid activity on wild   relatives of agricultural plants can identify how plant variation   contributes to the creation of a refuge. Beneficial plant traits can   then potentially be bred back into the crop germplasm in order to   enhance the biological control of insect pests in agroecosystems.",490,NA,TH,,,,

Parasites can influence ecosystem structure, function and dynamics by   mediating predator-prey interactions. Recurrent infestations of the   salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis associated with salmon aquaculture   may mediate interactions between juvenile salmonids. Louse infection   increases pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha susceptibility to   predation, resulting in the trophic transmission of lice (with an adult   male bias) to coho salmon O. kisutch predators. While experimental   evidence is accumulating, the extent to which trophic transmission   structures the distribution of lice among juvenile salmon in the wild is   unknown.   2. We used a hierarchical modelling approach to examine the abundance   and sex ratio of salmon lice on juvenile pink and coho salmon, collected   from a region of salmon aquaculture during sea louse infestations, to   test the hypothesis that trophic transmission of salmon lice increases   infection on coho that feed upon infected pink salmon prey.   3. As predicted, coho had higher adult and pre-adult louse abundance   than their pink salmon prey, and louse abundance was more adult male   biased on predators than sympatric prey. We estimate that trophic   transmission accounts for 53-67\% of pre-adult and adult louse infection   on coho.   4. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that, by evading   predation, salmon lice can accumulate up juvenile salmon food webs.   Predators, such as coho, can experience a two-to threefold increase in   parasite exposure through predation on infected prey than would   otherwise occur through passive exposure to infective larvae. Thus,   predation may intensify parasite exposure and undermine the protection   to ectoparasites conferred by the larger body size of predators. For   larger predatory wild juvenile salmon, the risk of louse transmission   from farmed salmon may therefore be greater than previously appreciated.   These findings argue for an ecosystem perspective in monitoring and   managing the marine environment in areas of intensive salmon aquaculture   that includes the productivity and ecological interactions of all   salmonid species.",491,NA,TH,,,,

Complexity of pathogen-host dynamics emerges   from processes driving local extinction of the pathogen, its hosts and   non-hosts. While the extinction of species may entail losses in   pathogen-host interactions and decrease the proportion of hosts infected   by a pathogen (prevalence), some studies suggest the opposite pattern.   Niche-based extinction, based on the species tolerance to environmental   conditions, may increase prevalence of infection because the pathogen   and its hosts persist, while other species go extinct. Hence,   understanding prevalence of infection requires disentangling random-and   niche-based extinction processes occurring simultaneously. To contribute   to this exercise, we analysed the prevalence of an environmentally   acquired, multi-host pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), in a unique   dataset of 16 communities of freshwater animals, surveyed during 12   months in Akonolinga, Cameroon in equatorial Africa. Two different   ecosystems were identified: rivers (lotic) and swamps and flooded areas   (lentic). Increased prevalence of MU infection was correlated with   niche-based extinction of aquatic host invertebrates and vertebrates in   the lentic ecosystems, whereas decreased prevalence was associated with   random disassembly of the lotic ecosystems. This finding suggests that   random and niche-based extinction of host taxa are key to assessing the   effect of local extinction of species on the ecology of environmentally   acquired and multi-host pathogens.",492,NA,TH,,,,

This disease causes lethal stem   infections in oaks (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus),   as well as non-lethal foliar infections in a range of other species.   We investigated two questions to evaluate the effect of landscape   structure on the spread of P. ramorum: (i) does the spatial pattern of   forested habitat predict P. ramorum disease severity, and is this   relationship scale-dependent; and (ii) what influence does spatial   pattern have on the optimal microclimate conditions for P. ramorum   reproduction?   We mapped the spatial distribution of suitable forest habitat for P.   ramorum and established 86 randomly located field plots within a   20-km(2) region of northern California. For each plot, we quantified P.   ramorum disease severity and measured the abundance of woody species.   Disease severity in each plot was examined in relation to the   surrounding landscape structure measured for nested landscapes of   increasing scale.   P. ramorum disease severity was greatest in plots surrounded by a high   proportion of contiguous forest, after accounting for plot-level   variables of host abundance, elevation, canopy cover and microclimate.   The explanatory power of the model increased with increasing scale up to   200 m, but was not significant at scales less than 50 m.   High disease severity was associated with lower temperatures in the   field than the laboratory-determined optimal range for pathogen   reproduction. Variation in microclimate conditions was explained by   elevation, not the pattern of host vegetation, indicating that spatially   varying disease severity was not a function of microclimate-related edge   effects on pathogen growth and survival.   Both landscape-scale configuration and local composition of host habitat   are related to the severity of this destructive forest disease.   Increased disease severity within contiguous woodlands may have a   considerable impact on the composition of such woodlands, with cascading   effects on the population dynamics of both host and pathogen.",493,NA,TH,,,,

Plants are known to rapidly respond to pathogen and   herbivore attack by reconfiguring their metabolism to reduce   pathogen/herbivore food acquisition. This involves the production of   defensive plant secondary compounds, but also an alteration of the plant   primary metabolism to fuel the energetic requirements of the direct   defence. Cytokinins are plant hormones that play a key role in plant   morphology, plant defence, leaf senescence and sourcesink relationships.   They are involved in numerous plantbiotic interactions. These   phytohormones may have been the target of arthropods and pathogens over   the course of the evolutionary arms race between plants and their biotic   partners to hijack the plant metabolism, control its physiology and/or   morphology and successfully invade the plant. In the case of arthropods,   cytokinin-induced phenotypes can be mediated by their bacterial   symbionts, giving rise to intricate plantmicrobeinsect interactions.   Cytokinin-mediated effects strongly impact not only plant growth and   defence but also the whole community of insect and pathogen species   sharing the same plant by facilitating or preventing plant invasion.   This suggests that cytokinins (CKs) are key regulators of the plant   growth-defence trade-off and highlights the complexity of the finely   balanced responses that plants use while facing both invaders and   mutualists.",494,NA,TH,,,,

While nutrient availability can affect many ecological   processes, here we investigate how N and P enrichment interact with   forest structure in three distinct zones (fringe, transition, dwarf) to   alter patterns of herbivory as a function of folivory, loss of yield,   and tissue mining. The effects of nutrient addition and zone varied by   functional feeding group or specific herbivore. Folivory ranged from 0   to 0.4\% leaf area damaged per month, but rates did not vary by either   nutrient enrichment or zone. Leaf lifetime damage ranged from 3 to 10\%   of the total leaf area and was caused primarily by the omnivorous tree   crab Aratus pisonii. We detected two distinct spatial scales of response   by A. pisonii that were unrelated to nutrient treatment, i.e., most   feeding damage occurred in the fringe zone and crabs fed primarily on   the oldest leaves in the canopy. Loss of yield caused by the bud moth   Ecdytolopha sp. varied by zone but not by nutrient treatment. A   periderm-mining Marmara sp. responded positively to nutrient enrichment   and closely mirrored the growth response by Rhizophora mangle across the   tree height gradient. In contrast, a leaf-mining Marmara sp. was   controlled by parasitoids and predators that killed > 89\% of its   larvae. Thus, nutrient availability altered patterns of herbivory of   some but not all mangrove herbivores.

Biological invasions, still occurring worldwide at an alarming   rate, are widely acknowledged as threats to the integrity and   functioning of ecosystems. In addition to introducing disease,   biological invasions have also been linked to sudden increases in the   incidence or severity of previously existing diseases. We review and   illustrate the potential direct and indirect impacts of introduced   species on the dynamics of endemic parasites in freshwater ecosystems.   2. Introduced species may trigger and sustain disease emergence by   acting as competent hosts for endemic parasites in which infection is   amplified and then `spilled back' to native hosts. In contrast, if   introduced species are not suitable hosts for endemic parasites but   become infected anyway, they may act as sinks for parasites and thus   dilute disease risk for native hosts.   3. Another mechanism by which introduced species can influence endemic   parasitic diseases is by altering the relative abundance of one of the   parasite's hosts in ways that could either enhance or reduce disease   transmission to other native hosts in the parasite's life cycle.   4. Introduced species may also alter disease incidence and severity in   native hosts through trait-mediated indirect effects. For example, the   introduced species could change the exposure or susceptibility of native   hosts to infection by causing alterations in their behaviour or   immunocompetence. Also, by directly changing physicochemical conditions   and modifying environmental stressors introduced species may indirectly   affect native host exposure and/or resistance to disease.   5. A survey of parasites infecting introduced freshwater fish in four   distinct geographical areas revealed that use of non-indigenous hosts by   endemic parasites is widespread, mostly involving parasites transmitted   via the food chain.   6.

Moreover,   urban agroecosystems could be managed so as to optimize ecosystem   services like natural pest control provided by trophic interactions   between natural enemies and herbivores. As in other ecosystems,   predation and parasitism regulate herbivores in urban settings, but less   is known about the relative importance of direct and indirect effects at   local and landscape scales in highly managed urban agroecosystems. We   collected data on herbivore (cabbage aphid) density and parasitism   ratios (proportion of parasitized aphid ``mummies'') in 25 community   gardens in three counties in the California central coast, USA. We used   structural equation modeling to examine the effects of direct factors   (host plant characteristics and parasitism) and indirect factors (soil,   garden, and landscape characteristics) on herbivore density changes at   two time points in the growing season (June and August). Aphid density,   but not parasitism, varied across counties over the season, and there   was a strong negative relationship between aphid density and parasitism.   Direct effects were strong drivers of aphid density but not parasitism.   In June, aphid density increased with host plant volume but decreased   with greater floral density, while parasitism was only influenced by   aphid density. In August, host plant volume similarly positively   affected aphid density, and soil water holding capacity increased host   plant volume. In addition, host plant density had a strong negative   effect on parasitism. Urban gardeners may be able to reduce aphid pest   densities by increasing floral resource density and strategically   spatially distributing host plants throughout garden beds, though these   processes depend on the season. The indirect effects of soil water   holding capacity on aphid densities further suggest a critical role of   human management on pest populations and pest control services through   soil amendments and irrigation.

Transmission of parasites between host species affects host   population dynamics, interspecific competition, and ecosystem structure   and function.

We develop a novel method for simulating transmission potential based   on both biotic and abiotic factors in a semi-arid system in Botswana.   Optimal timing of antiparasitic treatment in livestock is then compared   under a variety of alternative host scenarios, including seasonally   migrating wild hosts.   3. In this region, rainfall is the primary driver of seasonality of   transmission, but wildlife migration leads to spatial differences in the   effectiveness of treatment in domestic animals. Additionally, competent   migratory wildlife hosts move parasites across the landscape.   4. Simulated transmission potential matches observed patterns of   clinical disease in livestock in the study area.

We mapped the spatial   distribution of sudden oak death tree mortality using a new object-based   filter with 1.0 m resolution KOMPSAT-2 images. We integrated these data   with a physical simulation model of burn severity informed by post-fire   Landsat data. Model performance varied across stages of disease   establishment (early, middle and late) with stronger relationships   occurring during later stages of disease progression. Multiscale   statistical analysis of environmental drivers of burn severity in   diseased compared to healthy forests showed that sudden oak death tree   mortality altered relationships between burn severity and the   biophysical environment. Specifically, compared to the healthy forests,   those affected by disease exhibited higher landscape heterogeneity at   smaller spatial scales (e.g., 25 and 50 m), which has been associated   with decreased burn severity in the literature. Our results showed the   opposite pattern. That is, a disease-affected landscape comprising less   connected patches and higher patch shape complexity was more likely to   experience greater burn severity. This suggests that disease-caused   increases in surface fuels may have reduced the landscape's resistance   to fire and in turn increased burn severity in forest patches   neighboring disease-impacted forests.

For example,   parasitic dodder (Cuscuta spp.) can cause up to 80-100 \% yield loss in   heavily infested cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) patches. Despite   their ecological and economic importance, remarkably little is known   about how parasitic plants affect, or are affected by, host chemistry.   To examine chemically-mediated interactions between dodder and its   cranberry host, we conducted a greenhouse experiment asking whether: (1)   dodder performance varies with cranberry cultivar; (2) cultivars differ   in levels of phytohormones, volatiles, or phenolics, and whether such   variation correlates with dodder parasitism; (3) dodder parasitism   induced changes in phytohormones, volatiles, or phenolics, and whether   the level of inducible response varied among cultivars. We used five   cranberry cultivars to assess host attractiveness to dodder and dodder   performance. Dodder performance did not differ across cultivars, but   there were marginally significant differences in host attractiveness to   dodder, with fewer dodder attaching to Early Black than to any other   cultivar. Dodder parasitism induced higher levels of salicylic acid (SA)   across cultivars. Cultivars differed in overall levels of flavonols and   volatile profiles, but not phenolic acids or proanthocyanidins, and   dodder attachment induced changes in several flavonols and volatiles.   While cultivars differed slightly in resistance to dodder attachment, we   did not find evidence of chemical defenses that mediate these   interactions. However, induction of several defenses indicates that   parasitism alters traits that could influence subsequent interactions   with other species, thus shaping community dynamics.",509,NA,TH,,,,

We studied the soil nutrient concentrations   beneath four tree species with and without mistletoe infections. Effects   of species and infection status on soil nutrient concentrations were   tested using a general linear model (GLM). Soil nutrient concentrations   differed with tree species, infection status and their interaction (p <   0.05). The concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), potassium   (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were elevated beneath Sclerocarya   birrea and Diospyros mespiliformis, respectively. Soils beneath host   trees had higher nutrient concentrations and were slightly alkaline than   those beneath non-host trees. The concentration of soil nutrients   increased by a factor ranging from 2.25 for N, 2.28 for P, 8.55 for Ca,   3.78 for Mg up to 39 for K. The increase in below-canopy soil fertility   with mistletoe infection leads to an increase in the spatial   heterogeneity of nutrient availability with potential to alter   ecological factors such as species diversity and plant productivity. In   conclusion, we suggest that nutrient enrichment in tree-dominated   patches and associated increase in resource heterogeneity play an   important role in determining ecosystem structure and function in   semi-arid savanna.

Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) strongly shape the composition and   architecture of plant communities. A growing literature shows that   negative direct effects of LMH on vegetation frequently propagate to   suppress the abundance of smaller consumers. Indirect effects of LMH on   the behaviour of these consumers, however, have received comparatively   little attention despite their potential ecological significance.   2. We sought to understand (i) how LMH indirectly shape small-mammal   habitat use by altering the density and distribution of understorey   plants; (ii) how these effects vary with climatic context (here,   seasonality in rainfall); and (iii) the extent to which behavioural   responses of small mammals are contingent upon small-mammal density.   3. We tested the effects of a diverse LMH community on small-mammal   habitat use using 4 years of spatially explicit small-mammal trapping   and vegetation data from the UHURU Experiment, a replicated set of LMH   exclosures in semi-arid Kenyan savanna.   4. Small-mammal habitat use was positively associated with tree density   and negatively associated with bare (unvegetated) patches in all plots   and seasons. In the presence of LMH, and especially during the dry   season, small mammals consistently selected tree cover and avoided bare   patches. In contrast, when LMH were excluded, small mammals were weakly   associated with tree cover and did not avoid bare patches as strongly.   These behavioural responses of small mammals were largely unaffected by   changes in small-mammal density associated with LMH exclusion.   5. Our results show that LMH indirectly affect small-mammal behaviour,   and that these effects are influenced by climate and can arise via   density-independent mechanisms. This raises the possibility that   anthropogenic LMH declines might interact with changing patterns of   rainfall to alter small-mammal distribution and behaviour, independent   of numerical responses by small mammals to these perturbations. For   example, increased rainfall in East Africa (as predicted in many recent   climate-model simulations) may relax constraints on small-mammal   distribution where LMH are rare or absent, whereas increased aridity   and/or drought frequency may tighten them.",512,NA,TH,,,,

Net effects will be a product of   changes in the survival and traits (e. g., susceptibility, infectivity)   of both hosts and parasites. In separate laboratory experiments, we   exposed cercariae of the trematode Echinostoma trivolvis, and its first   and second intermediate hosts, snails (Planorbella trivolvis) and green   frog tadpoles (Rana clamitans), respectively, to one of four common   pesticides (atrazine, glyphosate, carbaryl, and malathion) at   standardized, ecologically relevant concentrations (201.0, 3700.0, 33.5,   and 9.6 mu g/L, respectively). We measured effects of pesticide exposure   on six mechanisms important to this host-parasite interaction: (1)   survival of E. trivolvis cercariae over 26 hours, (2) tadpole survival   over two weeks, (3) snail survival over four weeks, (4) snail growth and   fecundity, (5) cercarial infectivity, and (6) tadpole susceptibility to   a fixed number of cercariae. Pesticides, in general, caused   significantly greater mortality of E. trivolvis cercariae than did   control treatments, but atrazine was the lone chemical to significantly   reduce cercarial survival (LC50 value 267 mg/L) and then only at   concentrations greater than commonly found in aquatic ecosystems (>= 200   mu g/L). None of the pesticides significantly enhanced E. trivolvis   virulence, decreased tadpole survival, or reduced snail survival,   growth, or fecundity. Sublethal exposure of the cercariae to the   pesticides (4 h) did not significantly affect trematode encystment in R.   clamitans. In contrast, sublethal exposure of R. clamitans to each of   the four pesticides increased their susceptibility as measured by the   percentage of cercariae that encysted. The reduction in exposure to   trematodes due to pesticide-induced cercarial mortality (a   density-mediated effect) was smaller than the pesticide-induced increase   in amphibian susceptibility (a trait-mediated effect), suggesting that   the net effect of exposure to environmentally realistic levels of   pesticides will be to elevate amphibian trematode infections. These   findings highlight the importance of elucidating the lethal and   sublethal effects of anthropogenic factors on both hosts and parasites   to understand the mechanisms underlying changes in parasite transmission   and virulence, an approach that is especially needed for amphibians, a   taxon experiencing global disease-related declines.",513,NA,TH,,,,

Wetlands, in particular,   face ongoing and substantial threats from exurban development. We   predicted that exurbanization would reduce the diversity of wetland   amphibian and invertebrate communities and that more spatially   aggregated residential development would leave more undisturbed natural   land, thereby promoting greater local diversity. Using structural   equation models, we tested a series of predictions about the direct and   indirect pathways by which exurbanization extent, spatial pattern, and   wetland characteristics might affect diversity patterns in 38 wetlands   recorded during a growing season. We used redundancy, indicator species,   and nested community analyses to evaluate how exurbanization affected   species composition. In contrast to expectations, we found higher   diversity in exurban wetlands. We also found that housing aggregation   did not significantly affect diversity. Exurbanization affected   biodiversity indirectly by increasing roads and development, which   promoted permanent wetlands with less canopy cover and more aquatic   vegetation. These pond characteristics supported greater diversity.   However, exurbanization was associated with fewer temporary wetlands and   fewer of the species that depend on these habitats. Moreover, the best   indicator species for an exurban wetland was the ram's head snail, a   common disease vector in disturbed ponds. Overall, results suggest that   exurbanization is homogenizing wetlands into more permanent water   bodies. These more permanent, exurban ponds support higher overall   animal diversity, but exclude temporary wetland specialists. Conserving   the full assemblage of wetland species in expanding exurban regions   throughout the world will require protecting and creating temporary   wetlands.",514,NA,TH,,,,

We investigate the   optimal allocation. We find that animals with low reserves choose to   allocate less to defence than animals with higher reserves because when   reserves are low it is more important to increase reserves to reduce the   risk of starvation in the future. In general, investment in immune   defence increases monotonically with energy reserves. An exception is   when the animal can reduce its probability of death from disease by   reducing its foraging rate. In this case, allocation to immune defence   can peak at intermediate reserves. When food changes over time, the   optimal response depends on the frequency of changes. If the environment   is relatively stable, animals forage most intensively when the food is   scarce and invest more in immune defence when the food is abundant than   when it is scarce. If the environment changes quickly, animals forage at   low intensity when the food is scarce, but at high intensity when the   food is abundant. As the rate of environmental change increases, immune   defence becomes less dependent on food availability. We show that the   strength of selection on reserve-dependent immune defence depends on how   foraging intensity and immune defence determine the probability of death   from disease.",515,NA,TH,,,,

For the public water supply, water   reservoirs are often used which are affected by regular or accidental   contamination, which greatly influences the water quality. Microbial   indicators, limiting values of which are set by the relevant regulatory   documents, are defined both for the water supply and for drinking water   resources. We provide an overview of the main regulatory documents used   in the Russian Federation to assess the microbiological quality of water   resources and of methods and results about monitoring of Lake Baikal.   Lake Baikal is a well-known example of an oligotrophic deep-water lake   which serves as a source of drinking water. The microbial communities of   Lake Baikal are formed in the unique extreme environmental conditions   determining their metabolism: a low nutrient content and low average   annual temperature in the water column. The microbiological indicators   for the pelagic zone of the lake are quite constant, as was shown by   long-term observations. However, in these ecological conditions the   possibility must be taken into account that the water contains   microorganisms potentially hazardous to human health. Systematic annual   results have been presented (since 2005) of the microbiological   monitoring of coliform bacteria, thermotolerant coliforms (TTC),   coliphages, as well as Pseudomonas, Clostridium and Enterococcus in Lake   Baikal. It is shown that the spatial distribution of allochthonous   organotrophic and opportunistic bacteria is associated with the local   anthropogenic impact: settlements, deltas of the main tributaries or   domestic wastewater discharge. In the deep layers of the pelagic zone of   the lake, no groups of opportunistic bacteria were found. Moreover, as   the water depth increased, changes were found in the structure of the   microbial community. Oligotrophic and psychrotrophic microorganisms were   predominant there, while the amount of organotrophic microorganisms did   not exceed the background level. The widespread prevalence of   uncultivable bacterial forms in the natural environment and the ability   of pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria to move into an uncultivable   state make them of sanitary significance. It has been demonstrated that   new species of heterotrophic microorganisms can be cultivated when the   culture media and cultivation conditions are adapted. The experiments   show the possible mechanisms of survival for opportunistic bacteria.

However, in open   agricultural areas, both the long- and short-tubed flowers were   primarily visited by the exotic short-tongued B. terrestris, which   foraged illegitimately (by nectar robbing) on long-tubed flowers   (Trifolium pratense L.) and legitimately on short-tubed flowers (T   repens L. and Lavandula angustifolia Mill.). The invasion of B.   terrestris into open natural vegetation, in addition to open   agricultural areas, has recently been reported in Hokkaido. Even though   the exotic and dominant native bumble bees partition their habitat   according to landscape factors, the invasive bee has the potential to   alter the overall interactions within plant-pollinator systems in the   regions of open vegetation on Hokkaido island.

Understanding the benefits and costs of multiple mating of   queens is important because polyandry results in reduced relatedness   between siblings, reducing kin-selected benefits of helping while also   selecting for secondary social traits that reduce intracolony conflict.   The leading hypothesis for the benefits of polyandry in social insects   emphasizes advantages of a genetically diverse workforce. Workerless   social parasite species (inquilines) provide a unique opportunity to   test this hypothesis, since they are derived from social ancestors but   do not produce workers of their own. Such parasites are thus predicted   to evolve single mating because they would experience the costs of   multiple mating but not the benefits if such benefits accrue through the   production of a genetically diverse group of workers. Here we show that   the workerless social parasite Dolichovespula arctica, a derived   parasite of wasps, has reverted to obligate single mating from a   facultatively polyandrous ancestor, mirroring a similar reversion from   obligate polyandry to approximate monandry in a social parasite of   fungus-farming ants.

This approach is   particularly useful for the evaluation of cultural landscapes, which   represent the joint evolution of humans and nature across an extended   time span. Transhumance is a customary practice of mobile pastoralism,   involving the regular seasonal migration of livestock herds between   summer and winter pasturelands. This practice maintains unique cultural   landscapes in Mediterranean Spain, which have been shaped over many   centuries of pastoral activity. Drove roads, which are used for herd   migration, represent the most outstanding feature of these landscapes.   We used visually based landscape interpretation to evaluate social   perceptions of ecosystem services provided by the Conquense Drove Road   transhumance landscape in Spain. Face-to-face questionnaires (N = 314)   were given to a sample of local inhabitants, visitors, and urban   inhabitants. The questionnaires contained two pairs of photographs   depicting images of croplands and pine forests associated with the   transhumance landscape, with one photograph in each pair containing a   drove road. We compared the social perceptions of 16 ecosystem services   supplied by these two landscapes. These 16 services were divided into 3   types: provisioning, such as the production of food and water;   regulating, such as the control of climate and disease; and cultural,   such as spiritual and recreational benefits. We also identified   differences between landscapes with and without a drove road. Overall,   respondents recognized the higher capacity of forests to deliver a wider   range of ecosystem services to society compared with croplands.   Provisioning services were mostly associated with cropland, whereas   regulating services and cultural ecosystem services tended to be related   to forests. All three types of ecosystem services were more perceived by   respondents when a drove road was present in each landscape. However,   differences in the visual perception of ecosystem services supply and   preference for transhumance landscapes emerged in relation to certain   socio-demographic and cultural respondent characteristics such as a   previous relationship with transhumance and agriculture, rural/urban   origin and identity, environmental awareness, and cultural attachment to   a place. Four groups of respondents had consistent and diverging   ecosystem services appreciation, revealing various potential conflicts   and trade-offs.

Here, we evaluate vegetation carbon turnover   processes in GVMs participating in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model   Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP, including HYBRID4, JeDi, JULES, LPJml,   ORCHIDEE, SDGVM, and VISIT) using estimates of vegetation carbon   turnover rate (k) derived from a combination of remote sensing based   products of biomass and net primary production (NPP). We find that   current model limitations lead to considerable biases in the simulated   biomass and in k (severe underestimations by all models except JeDi and   VISIT compared to observation-based average k), likely contributing to   underestimation of positive feedbacks of the northern forest carbon   balance to climate change caused by changes in forest mortality. A need   for improved turnover concepts related to frost damage, drought, and   insect outbreaks to better reproduce observation-based spatial patterns   in k is identified. As direct frost damage effects on mortality are   usually not accounted for in these GVMs, simulated relationships between   k and winter length in boreal forests are not consistent between   different regions and strongly biased compared to the observation-based   relationships. Some models show a response of k to drought in temperate   forests as a result of impacts of water availability on NPP, growth   efficiency or carbon balance dependent mortality as well as soil or   litter moisture effects on leaf turnover or fire. However, further   direct drought effects such as carbon starvation (only in HYBRID4) or   hydraulic failure are usually not taken into account by the investigated   GVMs. While they are considered dominant large-scale mortality agents,   mortality mechanisms related to insects and pathogens are not explicitly   treated in these models.",536,NA,TH,,,,

We investigated the effect of   experimental fertilization on the vegetation, with the ribwort plantain   as the focal plant, and on higher trophic levels on differently managed   grasslands throughout Germany. Over a period of 2 years, we examined two   specialist herbivores and their parasitoid on Plantago lanceolata L.,   and the composition and structure of the surrounding vegetation. Over 70   sites in three geographic regions, within the large-scale project   ``German Biodiversity Exploratories'', were included in the study.

The parasitoid depended on the abundance of one of its   hosts, M. pascuorum (positively density-dependent). Reduced herbivore   abundance due to fertilization might be explained by a lower abundance   of the host plant, a lower stalk number, and by changed patterns of host   localization within higher vegetation. Fertilization negatively affected   the third trophic level by cascading up via host abundance. The   relationships between fertilization, surrounding vegetation and the   tritrophic system were measured throughout the three regions and over   the 2-year period.

Managing populations of predators and their prey to achieve   conservation or resource management goals is usually technically   challenging and frequently socially controversial. This is true even in   the simplest ecosystems but can be made much worse when predator-prey   relationships are influenced by complex interactions, such as biological   invasions, population trends or animal movements.   2. Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland is a European stronghold for pollan   Coregonus autumnalis, a coregonine fish and for river lamprey Lampetra   fluviatilis, which feeds parasitically as an adult. Both species are of   high conservation importance. Lampreys are known to consume pollan but   detailed knowledge of their interactions is scant. While pollan is well   known to be a landlocked species in Ireland, the life cycle of normally   anadromous river lamprey in Lough Neagh has been unclear. The Lough is   also a highly perturbed ecosystem, supporting several invasive,   non-native fish species that have the potential to influence   lamprey-pollan interactions.   3. We applied stable isotope techniques to resolve both the movement   patterns of lamprey and trophic interactions in this complex community.   Recognizing that stable isotope studies are often hampered by   high-levels of variability and uncertainty in the systems of interest,   we employed novel Bayesian mixing models, which incorporate variability   and uncertainty.   4. Stable isotope analyses identified trout Salmo trutta and non-native   bream Abramis brama as the main items in lamprey diet. Pollan only   represented a major food source for lamprey between May and July.   5. Stable isotope ratios of carbon in tissues from 71 adult lamprey   showed no evidence of marine carbon sources, strongly suggesting that   Lough Neagh is host to a highly unusual, nonanadromous freshwater   population. This finding marks out the Lough's lamprey population as of   particular scientific interest and enhances the conservation   significance of this feature of the Lough.   6.Synthesis and applications. Our Bayesian isotopic mixing models   illustrate an unusual pattern of animal movement, enhancing conservation   interest in an already threatened population. We have also revealed a   complex relationship between lamprey and their food species that is   suggestive of hyperpredation, whereby non-native species may sustain   high lamprey populations that may in turn be detrimental to native   pollan. Long-term conservation of lamprey and pollan in this system is   likely to require management intervention, but in light of this   exceptional complexity, no simple management options are currently   supported. Conservation plans will require better characterization of   population-level interactions and simulation modelling of interventions.   More generally, our study demonstrates the importance of considering a   full range of possible trophic interactions, particularly in complex   ecosystems, and highlights Bayesian isotopic mixing models as powerful   tools in resolving trophic relationships.",539,NA,TH,,,,

Given the economic and ecological importance of   bees, and the evidence of widespread population declines, the full   impacts of pesticides and their interactions with other stressors in the   environment need to be investigated.   Here, we focus on the impacts of chronic exposure to the commonly used   pyrethroid pesticide lambda ()-cyhalothrin on the bumblebee Bombus   terrestris at both the individual and colony level. Furthermore, we   investigated the interactions of pesticide exposure with a highly   prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi. Colonies were exposed to   -cyhalothrin in the laboratory, and colony growth and reproductive   output were monitored for up to 14weeks. The potential interactions   between the pesticide and C.bombi were investigated by quantifying the   impact of pesticide treatment on susceptibility to, and success of   experimental infections, as well as the survival of workers. Male   survival after larval pesticide exposure was also monitored.   Pesticide-treated colonies produced workers with a significantly lower   body mass. However, out of the twelve variables of colony development   measured, this was the only metric that was significantly affected by   pesticide treatment and there was no subsequent significant impact on   the reproductive output of colonies.   Lambda-cyhalothrin had no significant impact on the susceptibility of   workers to C.bombi, or intensity of parasitic infection.   Pesticide exposure did not cause differential survival in workers or   males, even when workers were additionally challenged with C.bombi.   Synthesis and applications.

Scleractinian corals represent particularly provocative subjects for   study in this context because they are morphologically complex and   associate with a broad diversity of macro invertebrates and vertebrates   as well as microorganisms. Representatives of all these taxonomic   groupings have been shown to contribute to the function of corals   through direct or indirect provisioning and cycling of nutrients, waste   removal, defense, and stress tolerance, traits that influence the   fitness and environmental thresholds of individual coral colonies. How   the taxonomic composition, functional limits and interactive nature of   members of these communities vary among and within host species, and   scale up to influence community level processes that drive ecosystem   structure and function through time and space is unknown; these   communities are, however, taxonomically variable among individual   corals. Here we draw on the published literature to discuss the   ecological and functional significance of the broad and variable   taxonomic symbioses found closely associated with corals. Using a   comparative approach, we hypothesize that the intra-specific and   inter-specific variations in response of corals to environmental   disturbance is linked to differences in the specificity, nature and   composition of these symbiotic assemblages and reflect variation in the   architectural complexity (micro and macro) and capacity of corals to   provision habitat.

Experiments that prove cause-and-effect   impacts of Bromus are rare, yet inferences can be gleaned from the   combination of Bromus-ecosystem associations, ecosystem condition   before/after invasion, and an understanding of underlying mechanisms.   Bromus typically establishes in bare soil patches and can eventually   replace perennials such as woody species or bunchgrasses, creating a   homogeneous annual cover. Plant productivity and cover are less stable   across seasons and years when Bromus dominates, due to a greater   response to annual climate variability. Bromus' ``flash'' of growth   followed by senescence early in the growing season, combined with   shallow rooting and annual habit, may lead to incomplete use of deep   soil water, reduced C sequestration, and accelerated nutrient cycling.   Litter produced by Bromus alters nearly all aspects of ecosystems and   notably increases wildfire occurrence. Where Bromus has become dominant,   it can decrease soil stability by rendering soils bare for months   following fire or episodic, pathogen-induced stand failure.   Bromus-invaded communities have lower species diversity, and associated   species tend to be generalists adapted to unstable and variable   habitats. Changes in litter, fire, and soil properties appear to   feedback to reinforce Bromus' dominance in a pattern that portends   desertification.",543,NA,TH,,,,

Fraterrigo",2012,Impacts of Hemlock Loss on Nitrogen Retention Vary with Soil Nitrogen   Availability in the Southern Appalachian Mountains,ECOSYSTEMS,1108-1120,1108-1120,10.1007/s10021-012-9572-9,"The impacts of exotic insects and pathogens on forest ecosystems are   increasingly recognized, yet the factors influencing the magnitude of   effects remain poorly understood. Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)   exerts strong control on nitrogen (N) dynamics, and its loss due to   infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) is expected   to decrease N retention in impacted stands. We evaluated the potential   for site variation in N availability to influence the magnitude of   effects of hemlock decline on N dynamics in mixed hardwood stands. We   measured N pools and fluxes at three elevations (low, mid, high)   subjected to increasing atmospheric N deposition where hemlock was   declining or absent (as reference), in western North Carolina. Nitrogen   pools and fluxes varied substantially with elevation and increasing N   availability. Total forest floor and mineral soil N increased (P <   0.0001, P = 0.0017, resp.) and forest floor and soil carbon (C) to N   ratio decreased with elevation (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0123, resp.),   suggesting that these high elevation pools are accumulating available N.   Contrary to expectations, subsurface leaching of inorganic N was minimal   overall (< 1 kg ha(-1) 9 months(-1)), and was not higher in stands with   hemlock mortality. Mean subsurface flux was 0.16 +/- A 0.04 (SE) (kg N   ha(-1) 100 days(-1)) in reference and 0.17 +/- A 0.05 (kg N ha(-1) 100   days(-1)) in declining hemlock stands. Moreover, although subsurface N   flux increased with N availability in reference stands, there was no   relationship between N availability and flux in stands experiencing   hemlock decline. Higher foliar N and observed increases in the growth of   hardwood species in high elevation stands suggest that hemlock decline   has stimulated N uptake and growth by healthy vegetation within this   mixed forest, and may contribute to decoupling the relationship between   N deposition and ecosystem N flux.",319,NA,TH,no,no data on PP,,no PP
