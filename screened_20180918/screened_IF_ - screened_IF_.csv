Scurlock",2015,Estimating the phenology of elk brucellosis transmission with   hierarchical models of cause-specific and baseline hazards,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,739-748,739-748,10.1002/jwmg.883,"Understanding the seasonal timing of disease transmission can lead to   more effective control strategies, but the seasonality of transmission   is often unknown for pathogens transmitted directly. We inserted vaginal   implant transmitters (VITs) in 575 elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis) from   2006 to 2014 to assess when reproductive failures (i.e., abortions or   still births) occur, which is the primary transmission route of Brucella   abortus, the causative agent of brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone   Ecosystem. Using a survival analysis framework, we developed a Bayesian   hierarchical model that simultaneously estimated the total baseline   hazard of a reproductive event as well as its 2 mutually exclusive parts   (abortions or live births). Approximately, 16\% (95\% CI=0.10, 0.23) of   the pregnant seropositive elk had reproductive failures, whereas 2\%   (95\% CI=0.01, 0.04) of the seronegative elk had probable abortions.   Reproductive failures could have occurred as early as 13 February and as   late as 10 July, peaking from March through May. Model results suggest   that less than 5\% of likely abortions occurred after 6 June each year   and abortions were approximately 5 times more likely in March, April, or   May compared to February or June. In western Wyoming, supplemental   feeding of elk begins in December and ends during the peak of elk   abortions and brucellosis transmission (i.e., Mar and Apr). Years with   more snow may enhance elk-to-elk transmission on supplemental feeding   areas because elk are artificially aggregated for the majority of the   transmission season. Elk-to-cattle transmission will depend on the   transmission period relative to the end of the supplemental feeding   season, elk seroprevalence, population size, and the amount of   commingling. Our statistical approach allowed us to estimate the   probability density function of different event types over time, which   may be applicable to other cause-specific survival analyses. It is often   challenging to assess the cause of death, or in this case whether the   reproductive event was an abortion or live birth. Accounting for   uncertainty in the event type is an important future addition to our   methodological approach. Published 2015.

Although Escherichia coli is an important indicator of waterborne   pathogens, the effects of environmental stressors on its survival in   aquatic environments remain poorly understood. We manipulated organic   nutrient, predation, and competition levels in outdoor microcosms   containing natural river water, sediments, and microbial populations to   determine their relative contribution to E. coli survival. The   activities of predator (protozoa) and competitor (indigenous bacteria)   populations were inhibited by adding cycloheximide or kanamycin. We   developed a statistical model of E. coli density over time that fits   with the data under all experimental conditions. Predation and   competition had significant negative effects on E. coli survival, while   higher nutrient levels increased survival. Among the main effects,   predation accounted for the greatest variation (40 \%) compared with   nutrients (25 \%) or competition (15 \%). The highest nutrient level   mitigated the effect of predation on E. coli survival. Thus, elevated   organic nutrients may disproportionately enhance the survival of E.   coli, and potentially that of other enteric bacteria, in aquatic   habitats.",2,NO,IF,,,,,

In southern South America, bamboo flowering and   subsequent mast seeding trigger rodent outbreaks associated with   zoonotic diseases. Predicting future flowering events requires knowledge   of the age of bamboo stands together with species-specific periodicity   in flowering. We explored whether it is possible to predict the minimum   age in bamboo plants based on the features of their rhizomes. We studied   bamboo stands of age known by the local people in 15 sites in the   coastal and Andes Mountains as well as in and the Central Valley of   southern Chile (37 degrees 48'- 43 degrees 58' S, from 12 to 1047   m.a.s.l.). For 164 individual plants, of five South American Chusquea   bamboo species (C. valdiviensis, C. uliginosa, C. culeou, C. montana,   and C. macrostachya), we collected and characterized the number and   shape of divisions of whole rhizomes. For all species sampled there was   a tight linear relationship between plant age and the number of rhizome   divisions or rhizomes, accounting for 11-99 \% of variation. In order to   overcome constraints caused by the limited number of age cohorts   available for individual species and to allow for prediction over a   wider range of age, we also fitted a common linear model to species with   similar age-rhizome relationships. We provide calibration relationships   that can be used for retrospectively estimating the date of last   flowering over large areas where bamboos form part of the understory and   for predicting the future flowering events.",3,NO,IF,,,,,

Pathogens, animal vectors, and reservoir   species have been unintentionally displaced across natural geographic   boundaries, resulting in serious human suffering and enormous economic   costs. Non-native diseases can also threaten ecosystems and put   ecosystem services and human well-being at risk. Introduced species and   environmental interactions have caused manifold new risks and challenges   for public health. Mosquitoes and ticks are the most important   non-native vectors of human diseases, although many different species   can serve as non-native reservoir hosts. In addition to imports as   contaminants with cargo, the pet trade is an important pathway of   introduction for non-native vectors and reservoirs. Evidence suggests   that global environmental change will further facilitate emerging   outbreaks of non-native human diseases, some of which may be re-emerging   old foes. The complex interrelationships between native and non-native   hosts, vectors, and pathogens entail inherent uncertainties and make   predictions about future outbreaks very challenging. Natural ecosystems   provide a regulating service for human well-being, and the loss of   biodiversity therefore represents a serious threat to human health. The   linkages between humans, animals, and environmental health are becoming   more apparent and call for collaborative efforts ('One Health') towards   a more responsible ecosystem stewardship.",4,NO,IF,,,,,

Nitrogen-fixing bacteria from representative soil series of   the Lower Rio Grande Valley region of southern Texas were examined for   their symbiotic association with common `Pinto' bean (Phaseolus vulgaris   L.). PCR-RFLP analyses of genes associated with nitrogen fixation   indicated that the bacterial isolates belong to the recently described   Rhizobium etli and none were identified as R. tropici. Examination of   symbiotic responses of the rhizobial isolates under controlled, aseptic   conditions, indicated that 20\% produced effective nodula-tion, 35\%   partially effective, and the remaining 45\% produced parasitic or   ineffective nodulation on the host legume. Strains UTPA-P 66, P82 and   P80, each isolated from a different soil series, accounted for maximum   plant response and nitrogen fixation activity. Although nodule   morphology and size markedly varied among isolates, those with the   highest tissue mass were associated with the highest production of shoot   biomass. Electron micrographs of cross sections of 2-week old nodules   indicated that effective bacterial cells were rod shaped, and more   abundant than those enclosed in the peribacteroid membranes of   ineffective nodules.

Snake   fungal disease is caused by the fungus Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola. Little   is known regarding the environmental or physiological variables that   affect host vulnerability and O. ophiodiicola virulence in wild snake   populations. Understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that   correlate with infection severity is a key first step in understanding   hostpathogen dynamics. Host vulnerability may vary seasonally as a   result of thermal conditions or energetic trade-offs, and pathogen   growth rates or dispersal may be tied to seasonal trends in climate. To   determine whether season, environmental temperature or energetic   trade-offs associated with life-history stage influence an individual's   susceptibility to infection, we monitored the severity of clinical signs   of SFD, surface air temperature, reproductive status, body condition and   serum complement activity (plasma bactericidal ability) in free-ranging   pigmy rattlesnakes, Sistrurus miliarius, over the course of 18 months.   Seasonal increases in the severity of clinical signs of SFD were   correlated negatively with monthly air surface temperature and the mean   body condition of the population. Bactericidal ability varied   seasonally, but pigmy rattlesnakes suffering from active SFD infections   did not exhibit deficits in innate immune function. Infected snakes were   in significantly lower body condition when compared with the general   population, but seasonal patterns in the mean body condition of the   population were not driven by seasonal patterns of infection severity.   Our results highlight the potential importance of the thermal   environment and energetic status in determining infection severity and   outcomes and the need for managers and researchers to consider   seasonality of symptom presentation when the goal is to identify the   prevalence or incidence of SFD in populations.",6,NO,IF,,,,,

We used   Ceratocystidaceae fungi as an empirical system to explore the potential   of metacommunity principles to explain the incidence of putative fungal   tree pathogens in natural ecosystems. The diversity of Ceratocystidaceae   fungi was evaluated on elephant-damaged trees across the Kruger National   Park of South Africa. Multivariate statistics were then used to assess   the influence of landscapes, tree hosts and nitidulid beetle associates   as well as isolation by distance on fungal community structure. Eight   fungal and six beetle species were recovered from trees representing   several plant genera. The distribution of Ceratocystidaceae fungi was   highly heterogeneous across landscapes. Both tree host and nitidulid   vector emerged as key factors contributing to this heterogeneity, while   isolation by distance showed little influence. Our results are   consistent with a model of metacommunity dynamics combining species   sorting and patch dynamics processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British   Mycological Society.

Counter to the normal expectation, host-parasite   specialization was significantly lower in heterogeneous compared with   homogeneous environments. This result could not be explained by   dispersal homogenizing populations, as this would have resulted in the   heterogeneous treatments having levels of specialization equal to or   greater than that of the homogeneous environments. We argue that   selection for costly generalists is greatest when the coevolving species   are exposed to diverse environmental conditions and that this can   provide an explanation for our results. A simple coevolutionary model of   this process suggests that this can be a general mechanism by which   environmental heterogeneity can reduce rather than increase   host-parasite specialization.",8,NO,IF,,,,,

Soils collected from   an old C. atlantica forest and pre-cultivated with each of the target   plant species (L. dentata and T. satureoides). After 5 months of   cultivation, they were uprooted and the treated substrate was amended or   not with Khouribga Rock Phosphate (KRP). Then pots were filled with the   soil mixtures and planted with one pre-germinated seed of C. atlantica.   The results show that pre-cultivation step with native mycotrophic plant   species improves the mycorrhizal soil infectivity, modifies soil   microbial functionalities and increases the impact of rock phosphate   amendment on the C. atlantica growth.

A common approach is to rely almost entirely on   DNA sequence data for estimates of microbial diversity, but to date   there is no objective method of clustering sequences into groups that is   grounded in evolutionary theory of what constitutes a biological   lineage. The general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model uses a   likelihood-based approach to distinguish population-level processes   within lineages from processes associated with speciation and   extinction, thus identifying a distinct point where extant lineages   became independent. Using two independent surveys of DNA sequences   associated with a group of ubiquitous plant-symbiotic fungi, we compared   estimates of species richness derived using the GMYC model to those   based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined by fixed levels of   sequence similarity. The model predicted lower species richness in these   surveys than did traditional methods of sequence similarity. Here, we   show for the first time that groups delineated by the GMYC model better   explained variation in the distribution of fungi in relation to putative   niche-based variables associated with host species identity, edaphic   factors, and aspects of how the sampled ecosystems were managed.

The biomass revealed that mycorrhizal   dependencies (MD) on the native AMF of the dominants were much higher   than those of the subordinates, while MD on the introduced AMF changed   following the replacement of native AMF with introduced AMF.

Due to global warming and other changes in the environment, many   native and exotic plant species show range expansion from lower to   higher latitudes. In the new range, the (in)ability of range-expanding   plants to establish associations with local soil microbes can have   important consequences for plant abundance; however, very little   information exists on rhizosphere communities of range-expanding plant   species. Here, we examine the rhizosphere microbial community   composition of range-expanding plant species in comparison with   phylogenetically related species that are native in the invaded range.   2. We tested the hypothesis that range-expanding plants species would   promote fewer shifts in rhizosphere communities than congeneric natives   would. In order to test this, soil was collected from the invaded   habitat and six range-expanding and nine congeneric natives were planted   individually in pots to condition soil microbial communities.   3. After harvesting, individuals of the same species were planted in   conditioned own and control soils to test the legacy effects of soil   conditioning on biomass production. The control soils were mixtures of   soils conditioned by all other plant species, except congenerics. After   10weeks of plant growth, we determined the rhizosphere community   composition of bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and   Fusarium spp.   4. All groups of microbes were analysed qualitatively using denaturating   gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Ergosterol was determined as a   quantitative measure of nonarbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomass, and   real-time PCR was applied to detect amounts of Fusarium spp.   5. Range-expanding plants had less fungal hyphal biomass and lower   amounts of Fusarium spp. in the rhizosphere than congenerics. Bacterial   community composition was influenced by a combination of soil   conditioning and plant origin, whereas fungal communities, AMF and   Fusarium spp. were less pronounced in their responses to the   experimental treatments.   6. Synthesis. We conclude that the lack of legacy effects in   range-expanding plant species compared with natives may be due to   differences in bacterial rhizosphere community composition, or to   different quantities of potential pathogenic fungi. If the   range-expanding plant species were benefiting more from AMF, effects   will not have been due to differences in community composition, but we   cannot exclude other options, such as different effectiveness of AMF or   other soil biota in the rhizosphere of range-expanding vs. native plant   species. The greater accumulation of bacterial and fungal pathogens in   the rhizosphere of natives in relation to range expanders might explain   the successful establishment of range-expanding plants.",13,NO,IF,,,,,

Prey digestion proceeded in   2 phases: a digestive phase which lasted similar to 25 mm and a   defecation competent phase that showed limited digestive activity and   was variable in length. The number of prey cells per food vacuole was   found to influence the effectiveness of prey digestion. Complete   digestion of the vacuole content was more likely to occur when the   number of prey per vacuole averaged similar to 6 or less. At higher   levels, only partial digestion of the vacuole content was recorded and   some undigested prey were egested from the ciliate cell. A strain of   Synechococcus sp. was never digested by this ciliate. Results suggest   that bacteria do not necessarily require elaborate mechanisms to evade   digestion by protozoa, as possessed by some pathogenic bacteria, but   that inefficiency in the protozoan digestive system is all that is   required to allow the release of undigested, apparently unharmed prey   from their cells. Thus, models on carbon cycling which employ data on   protistan ingestion rates alone should consider accounting for digestion   efficiency and the subsequent effect of prey concentration, because prey   carbon might not always be transferred efficiently to higher trophic   levels.",14,NO,IF,,,,,

Empirical studies suggest   that some populations of primary consumers grow rapidly in response to   resource pulses, but others instead remain at low abundance despite   increases in resource availability. Previous theory suggests that the   lack of increase in primary consumers might be due to predators, which   can respond to increased prey density both numerically, by increasing   their own population, and functionally, by killing prey at a faster   rate. The complexity of potential population responses to resource   pulses can be assessed with simulations, but analytical conditions   determining when one observes qualitatively distinct dynamics have yet   to be identified. Here we use a graphical method based on a bifurcation   diagram to derive the conditions leading to qualitatively distinct   steady state and transient prey population dynamics as levels of   predation (abundance and diversity) vary. When predation thresholds are   crossed, consumer populations respond numerically to increases in their   resources and provide a secondary resource pulse to their predators and   parasites.

Ecological network changes along   primary successions are poorly known: to address such topic, gradient of   primary succession on glacier forelands is an ideal model, as sites of   different age since deglaciation stand for different ecosystem   developmental stages. We aimed to investigate the assembly processes of   plant-insect networks and to elucidate its functional implications for   ecosystem stability along this time sequence succession. We collected   data on the functional role of anthophilous insect groups and performed   network analysis to evaluate their relative importance in the structure   of plant-insect interaction networks with increasing time since   deglaciation along the primary succession of a debris-covered glacier   foreland. We sampled anthophilous insects visiting the flowers of two   models plant species, Leucanthemopsis alpina and Saxifraga bryoides.   Insects were identified and trophic roles were attributed to each taxon   (detritivores, parasitoids, phytophagous, pollinators, predators, and   opportunists) at five sites representing the primary succession   gradient. Plant-insect interactions were visually represented by a   bipartite network for each successional stage. For each plant species   and insect group, centrality indices were computed quantifying their   community importance. For the whole network, centralization and link   density were calculated. Pollinators dominated pioneer communities on   the debris-covered glacier and in recently deglaciated areas, while   parasitoids, predators and opportunists characterised late-succession   stages. Plant species centrality varied along the succession.   Pollinators showed initially higher but then decreasing centrality,   while the centrality of predators and parasitoids increased with time   since deglaciation. Along the same gradient link density showed an   increasing trend while network centralization tended to decrease. The   present study provides new insight into the initial steps of   plant-insect network assembly and sheds light on the relationship   between structure and dynamic in ecological networks. In particular,   during the succession process, more links are formed and   plant-anthophilous insect interactions change from a network dominated   by pollinators to a functionally more diversified food web. We conclude   that applying network theory to the study of primary succession provides   a useful framework to investigate the relationship between community   structure and ecosystem stability.

We first   define Diversified Farming Systems (DFS) as farming practices and   landscapes that intentionally include functional biodiversity at   multiple spatial and/or temporal scales in order to maintain ecosystem   services that provide critical inputs to agriculture, such as soil   fertility, pest and disease control, water use efficiency, and   pollination.

DFS are components of social-ecological systems that   depend on certain combinations of traditional and contemporary   knowledge, cultures, practices, and governance structures. Further, as   ecosystem services are generated and regenerated within a DFS, the   resulting social benefits in turn support the maintenance of the DFS,   enhancing its ability to provision these services sustainably. We   explore how social institutions, particularly alternative agri-food   networks and agrarian movements, may serve to promote DFS approaches,   but note that such networks and movements have other primary goals and   are not always explicitly connected to the environmental and   agroecological concerns embodied within the DFS concept.

BYDV titre increased significantly by 36.8\% in leaves of wheat grown   under eCO(2) conditions compared to aCO(2). Plant growth parameters   including height, tiller number, leaf area and biomass were generally   higher in plants exposed to higher CO2 levels but increased growth did   not explain the increase in BYDV titre in these plants. High virus titre   in plants has been shown to have a significant negative effect on plant   yield and causes earlier and more pronounced symptom expression   increasing the probability of virus spread by insects. The combination   of these factors could negatively impact food production in Australia   and worldwide under future climate conditions. This is the first   quantitative evidence that BYDV titre increases in plants grown under   elevated CO2 levels.",18,NO,IF,,,,,

The aim of this study was to   utilize microbial profiling to assess overall patterns of variation in   the BBD bacterial community with respect to geographic location, host   coral species, time, and nutrient regime. Length heterogeneity   polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) was employed to differentiate BBD   communities based on the natural variation in the sequence lengths   within hypervariable domains of the 16S rRNA gene. Analysis of LH-PCR   profiles of 97 BBD samples using multivariate ordination methods and   analysis of similarity revealed significant clustering with respect to   geographic region when comparing BBD sampled from reefs near Lee   Stocking Island in the Bahamas' Exuma Chain, the Northern Florida Keys   (NFK), and St. John in the US Virgin Islands. There was much variability   in BBD community composition on a regional basis, between sites in the   NFK, and in terms of coral host species. The observed differences among   BBD microbial community profiles were driven primarily by variation in   relative abundance of 313-316-bp amplicons, which correspond to   cyanobacteria and alpha-proteobacteria. The results obtained in this   study support previous reports of intrinsic variability and complexity   of the BBD microbial community but also suggest that this variability   has biogeographic patterns.",19,NO,IF,,,,,

Here, we tested whether foliar fungal   disease incidence was negatively affected by tree species diversity in   different forest types across Europe. We measured the foliar fungal   disease incidence on 16 different tree species in 209 plots in six   European countries, representing a forest-type gradient from the   Mediterranean to boreal forests. Forest plots of single species   (monoculture plots) and those with different combinations of two to five   tree species (mixed species plots) were compared. Specifically, we   analyzed the influence of tree species richness, functional type   (conifer vs. broad-leaved) and phylogenetic diversity on overall fungal   disease incidence. The effect of tree species richness on disease   incidence varied with latitude and functional type. Disease incidence   tended to increase with tree diversity, in particular in northern   latitudes. Disease incidence decreased with tree species richness in   conifers, but not in broadleaved trees. However, for specific damage   symptoms, no tree species richness effects were observed.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of   Ulmus glabra Hudson (wych elm) that are relevant to understanding its   ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented   within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British   Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral   and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.   2. Ulmus glabra is a large forest tree, and often an important canopy   tree in ancient and semi-natural woodlands. It is primarily native to   the north and west of Britain and much of mainland Europe. It is the   only elm native to Ireland. It is the most distinct of the British elms   in that it rarely suckers and sets abundant viable seed. Although found   on limestone screes and cliffs, and hedgerows, it is primarily a   woodland tree, especially on moist, basic soils. In many secondary   woodlands, it often co-occurs with Acer pseudoplatanus and has   ecological needs that are similar to Fraxinus excelsior.   3. Ulmus glabra has clusters of c. 25 hermaphrodite flowers appearing   before the leaves on previous year's growth. Seeds are wind-dispersed,   falling in April to July, but remain viable for only a few days.   Nevertheless, seedling establishment can be abundant. Hybridisation with   other northern European elms is common but hybrids are notoriously   difficult to identify and therefore probably under-recorded.   4. The health and survival of wych elm in Europe has been seriously   compromised since the 1970s due to Dutch elm disease caused by the   fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, transmitted by elm bark beetles (Scolytus   spp.). To the south of its Scottish stronghold, many elms are reduced to   small trees regrowing from basal sprouts or seeds. These trees tend to   be reinfected once trunk diameter exceeds 10 cm. Fortunately for its   long-term survival, seed production usually begins a number of years   before they are reinfected.",21,NO,IF,,,,,

Although glyphosate is used worldwide as an   herbicide, its effects on root symbionts under natural conditions have   not been sufficiently studied. We performed a field experiment to   evaluate the influence of glyphosate, used for promoting winter forage   production, on the viability of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and   rhizobium propagules and other ecosystem traits in native grasslands.   The number of viable propagules was strongly reduced with a single   application at the recommended dose. Spore viability reduction was   dependent on AMF species. Furthermore, changes in plant community   composition and soil salinity were detected, which may eventually   influence these symbionts in the future. Considering the low nutrient   availability and high root-symbiont dependency of several species with   forage value, repeated applications might lead to a loss in the   grassland diversity and productivity, decreasing livestock production.   Application of sublethal doses of this herbicide could avoid these   damages, although success in increasing winter forage production would   be less.

Several species of birds appear to be the primary   reservoir hosts, whereas other bird species, as well as other vertebrate   species, can be infected but are less competent reservoirs. One   hypothesis regarding the transmission dynamics of West Nile virus   suggests that high bird diversity reduces West Nile virus transmission   because mosquito blood-meals are distributed across a wide range of bird   species, many of which have low reservoir competence. One mechanism by   which this hypothesis can operate is that high-diversity bird   communities might have lower community-competence, defined as the sum of   the product of each species' abundance and its reservoir competence   index value. Additional hypotheses posit that West Nile virus   transmission will be reduced when either: (1) abundance of mosquito   vectors is low; or (2) human population density is low. We assessed   these hypotheses at two spatial scales: a regional scale near Saint   Louis, MO, and a national scale (continental USA). We found that   prevalence of West Nile virus infection in mosquito vectors and in   humans increased with decreasing bird diversity and with increasing   reservoir competence of the bird community.

However, it   is difficult to imagine a forest management approach that can   simultaneously minimize all risks of damage. Multicriteria decision   analysis (MCDA) has been developed to help decision makers choose   between actions that require reaching a compromise among criteria of   different weights. We adapted this method and produced a multicriteria   risk analysis (MCRA) to compare the risk of damage associated with   various forest management systems with a range of management intensity.   The objective was to evaluate the effect of four forest management   alternatives (FMAs) (i.e., close to nature, extensive management with   combined objectives, intensive even-aged plantations, and short-rotation   forestry for biomass production) on biotic and abiotic risks of damage   in eight regional case studies combining three forest biomes (Boreal,   Continental, Atlantic) and five tree species (Eucalyptus globulus, Pinus   pinaster, Pinus sylvestris, Picea sitchensis, and Picea abies) relevant   to wood production in Europe. Specific forest susceptibility to a series   of abiotic (wind, fire, and snow) and biotic (insect pests, pathogenic   fungi, and mammal herbivores) hazards were defined by expert panels and   subsequently weighted by corresponding likelihood. The PROMETHEE ranking   method was applied to rank the FMAs from the most to the least at risk.   Overall, risk was lower in short-rotation forests designed to produce   wood biomass, because of the reduced stand susceptibility to the most   damaging hazards. At the opposite end of the management intensity   gradient, close-to-nature systems also had low overall risk, due to   lower stand value exposed to damage. Intensive even-aged forestry   appeared to be subject to the greatest risk, irrespective of tree   species and bioclimatic zone. These results seem to be robust as no   significant differences in relative ranking of the four FMAs were   detected between the combinations of forest biomes and tree species.",24,NO,IF,,,,,

Because green plants sprout both to photosynthesize and to reproduce,   the lack of photosynthesis in myco-heterotrophs suggests that these   plants need only to sprout to reproduce. Further, they may be   long-lived, with fitness favoring high, stable survival over frequent   reproduction and leading to size-biased reproduction. We hypothesized   that sprouting would be rare and would always lead to flowering in a   ten-year monitoring study of a myco-heterotrophic plant, the autumn   coral root Corallorhiza odontorhiza. We also postulated that these   plants would exhibit strong size-based flowering patterns. We tested   these hypotheses by parameterizing a variety of mark-recapture models of   survival, fecundity, and demographic transitions among two life history   stages: flowering and non-sprouting (vegetatively dormant). We further   developed and tested novel models estimating the influence of   reproduction on demographic transitions one, two, and three years after   flowering. Our results suggested that this population is typically   subterranean, with only a small proportion of living plants actually   sprouting in any given year. Plants typically flowered and fruited when   they sprouted (flowering frequency > 0.99), supporting our first   hypothesis that sprouting occurs only in concert with reproduction. We   also found that reproduction was associated with long-term reproductive   demographic impacts-plants that flowered more in the past three years   were more likely to continue doing so than those that flowered only   once. Our use of `memory' mark-recapture models, in which transitions   across years are allowed to vary with demographic events occurring   across several previous years, proved a powerful means of testing for   their long-term impacts of reproductive events.",25,NO,IF,,,,,

We   found that the floral visitor community varied considerably among   genotypes, driven predominantly by variation in floral phenology among   S. altissima clones. Floral visitors also varied among nutrient   treatments, though this response was much weaker than to different plant   genotypes, and was likely driven by effects of floral rewards rather   than of floral phenology. Importantly, we also detected several G X E   interactions for both flowering and floral visitors.

However, trade-offs are probably not static, invariant   relationships. Instead, ecological factors can shift, alter, or reverse   the relationships underlying trade-offs and create critical genotype x   environment (G x E) interactions. But which ecological factors alter   trade-offs or create G x E interactions, and why (mechanistically) do   they do this? We tackle these questions using resource quality as the   central ecological factor and a case study of disease in the plankton.   We show that clonal genotypes of a zooplankton host (Daphnia dentifera)   exhibit a ``power-efficiency'' trade-off in resource use, where powerful   (fast-feeding) host clones perform well on richer algal resources, but   more efficient (slow-feeding) clones perform relatively well on poorer   resources. This resource-based trade-off then influences epidemiological   relationships due to fundamental connections between resources and   fecundity, transmission rate (an index of resistance), and replication   of a virulent fungal parasite (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) within hosts.   For instance, using experiments and dynamic energy budget models, we   show that the power-efficiency trade-off overturned a previously   detected trade-off between fecundity and transmission risk of hosts to   this parasite. When poorer resources were eaten, transmission risk and   fecundity were negatively, not positively, correlated. Additionally,   poor resource quality changed positive relationships between yield of   infectious stages (spores) and host fecundity: those fecundity-spore   relationships with poor food became negative or nonsignificant. Finally,   the power-efficiency trade-off set up an interaction between host clone   and resource quality for yield of fungal spores: powerful clones yielded   relatively more spores on the better resource, while efficient clones   yielded relatively more on the poorer resource.

The bulk of research   and management has focused on the breeding season, although several   issues remain unsettled, including the spatial extent of habitat   influences on fitness and the importance of habitat on the breeding   grounds used after breeding. Although detailed investigations have shed   light on the ecology and population dynamics of a few avian species,   knowledge is sketchy for most species. Replication of comprehensive   studies is needed for multiple species across a range of areas.   Information deficiencies are even greater during the wintering season,   when birds require sites that provide security and food resources needed   for survival and developing nutrient reserves for spring migration and,   possibly, reproduction. Research is needed on many species simply to   identify geographic distributions, wintering sites, habitat use, and   basic ecology. Studies are complicated, however, by the mobility of   birds and by sexual segregation during winter. Stable-isotope   methodology has offered an opportunity to identify linkages between   breeding and wintering sites, which facilitates understanding the   complete annual cycle of birds.   The twice-annual migrations are the poorest-understood events in a   bird's life. Migration has always been a risky undertaking, with such   anthropogenic features as tall buildings, towers, and wind generators   adding to the risk. Species such as woodland specialists migrating   through eastern North America have numerous options for pausing during   migration to replenish nutrients, but some species depend on limited   stopover locations. Research needs for migration include identifying   pathways and timetables of migration, quality and distribution of   habitats, threats posed by towers and other tall structures, and any   bottlenecks for migration.   Issues such as human population growth, acid deposition, climate change,   and exotic diseases arc global concerns with uncertain consequences to   migratory birds and even less-certain remedies.

A common assumption is that insects that exploit   carcasses are exposed to a high density of potentially harmful   microorganisms, but no field data have so far validated this.   Necrophagous beetles such as the Scarabaeinae have complex nesting   behaviors with elaborate parental care. So here, we begin to explore   whether this conjunction of life history and nesting behavior represents   an adaptive response to the threat posed by microbes in these   environments, mainly by entomopathogens. We evaluated the density and   distribution of fungi and bacteria from soil near the carcasses, and   their ability to infect and kill insects that are in contact with this   soil during the decomposition process. Our data showed an increase in   the density and activity of opportunistic or facultative pathogens   during the apex of decomposition, when there is a predominance of   necrophagous insects. Meanwhile, the survivorship of bait insects   decreased when in contact with soil from this period of decomposition,   indicating a potential risk of infection. However, the density and   activity of these microorganisms decreased with distance from the   carcass, mainly with depth, which would benefit tunneller beetles in   particular. We have thus provided the first field data to show that   necrophagous insects are indeed exposed to high densities of potentially   harmful microorganisms. Furthermore, we propose that some parental care   strategies may have arisen not only as a response to competition, but   also as adaptations that reduce the risks of disease.

When we manipulated   the density of artificial algae in a breeding area in the Baltic Sea,   more males nested in dense than in sparse vegetation, but the males in   dense vegetation were more parasitized. Interestingly, heavily   parasitized males acquired more eggs than less parasitized males in   dense vegetation but not in sparse vegetation. The higher probability of   reproduction for parasitized males in dense algae growth could be due to   impaired visibility relaxing male-male competition or reducing female   choosiness. This could favour males in poor condition that often invest   more in attracting females than males in good condition. In sparse   vegetation, parasitized males may have a lower reproductive success due   to intense male-male competition, careful female choice and high   predation rate selecting against parasitized males.

Cattle   dung-baited pitfall traps were used to measure repellent effects of   deltamethrin in dung on Scarabaeidae. Dung decomposition rate was also   examined. There was significantly increased mortality of adult dung   beetles colonizing pats that contained deltamethrin compared to   insecticide-free pats.

The   community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) responds to these   changes, sporulating and reducing its activity during the dry season,   and slowly reestablishing itself following abandonment of cultivated   fields. To determine the dynamics of the AMP community in response to   natural phenomena and anthropogenic disturbances, we collected soil   samples during the wet and dry seasons from plots with different time   periods since abandonment of agricultural activity, categorized as early   (less than 5 years), middle (11-23 years), and late (over 30 years) age   plots. From each plot, AMF spores were isolated and identified in order   to estimate abundance, richness and diversity. In addition, the number   of infective propagules and value of mycorrhizal inoculum potential were   calculated for each plot. Twenty-three species were recorded, for which   Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae were the most commonly represented   families. Significant differences were found in AMP species richness   among plots and seasons and the diversity index of AMP was higher than   1.0 in most cases. There were no significant differences in spore   abundance. Viable propagules were observed in all soil samples, with   fluctuations relating mainly to time since abandonment. Overall,   seasonality has a strong influence on AMF diversity but not on AMP   infectivity, while time since abandonment had a more important impact.   (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Our   results suggest that, regionally, coral cover has been relatively stable   since this event (i.e. from 1982 to 2006). The largest increase in   macroalgal cover was in 1986, 3 yr after the regional die-off of the   urchin grazer Diadema antillarum began. Subsequently, macroalgal cover   declined in 1987 and has been stable since then. Regional mean (+/-1 SE)   macroalgal cover from 2001 to 2005 was 15.3 +/- 0.4\% (n = 1821   surveys). Caribbean-wide mean (+/-1 SE) coral cover was 16.0 +/- 0.4\%   (n = 1547) for this same time period.

We found four main obstacles to the development and application   of a sustainability-based health management system. First, salmon   farming faced the same challenges as other industries when trying to   establish an operational definition of sustainability that captures all   stakeholders' interests. Second, there was no program responsible for   integrating the various regulations, responsible departments, and   monitoring efforts to develop a comprehensive view of sustainability.   Third, there was inadequate research base and social consensus on the   criteria that should be used to track health outcomes for sustainability   purposes. Fourth, the regulatory and management paradigm for salmon   farming has been focused on diseases and pathogens as opposed to   embracing a more inclusive health promotion model that includes biotic,   abiotic, and social determinants of health.

Farmers, commercial enterprises, patients, doctors and policy makers   have to adapt pro-actively to cope with, prevent or reduce potential   negative impacts. Adaptation should be relatively easy in most cases   because people have to `only' change the timing of their activities.   However, pro-active adaptation is currently often unfeasible because   stakeholders do not know what phenological changes will happen where and   when. They also are not aware of the ecological and socio-economic   consequences of such phenological changes. They seem to miss a sense of   urgency to act. Furthermore, they miss an understanding on whether, how   and when to respond in order to prevent (further) negative impacts or to   benefit from the emerging changes.   To adequately respond to phenological change and to improve the   adaptation potential, there is a need to (1) continue and improve   monitoring of phenological changes; (2) advance the analysis of   phenological changes and its socio-economic and environmental impact;   (3) improve the projections of phenological changes and their impacts;   and (4) improve the communication on observations, knowledge, tools and   techniques.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids   (PUFAs) are essential dietary nutrients; they are indispensable as   structural components of cell membranes and as precursors for   eicosanoids, signalling molecules which act on reproduction and   immunity. Here, we explored the potential of dietary PUFAs to affect the   course of parasitic infections using a well-established invertebrate   host - parasite system, the freshwater herbivore Daphnia magna and its   bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa.   Results: Using natural food sources differing in their PUFA composition   and by experimentally modifying the availability of dietary arachidonic   acid (ARA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) we examined PUFA-mediated   effects resulting from direct consumption as well as maternal effects on   offspring of treated mothers. We found that both host and parasite were   affected by food quality. Feeding on C20 PUFA-containing food sources   resulted in higher offspring production of hosts and these effects were   conveyed to a great extent to the next generation. While feeding on a   diet containing high PUFA concentrations significantly reduced the   likelihood of becoming infected, the infection success in the next   generation increased whenever the maternal diet contained PUFAs. We   suggest that this opposing effect was caused by a trade-off between   reproduction and immunity in the second generation.   Conclusions: Considering the direct and maternal effects of dietary   PUFAs on host and parasite we propose that host - parasite interactions   and thus disease dynamics under natural conditions are subject to the   availability of dietary PUFAs.",40,NO,IF,,,,,

The objective of this paper is to propose a system that extends red   clover usage into the corn phase of the corn-soy-wheat rotation as a   living mulch. The system incorporates strip-tillage, strip-mowing, as   well as banded herbicide and fertilizer application in order to maximize   productivity and minimize competition. We analyzed the feasibility of   this proposal by examining red clover's adequacy for the proposed system   in comparison with other broadleaf, leguminous cover crops, and assessed   potential agro-ecological benefits. We considered logistical components   of the proposition, including the use of strip-tillage, the application   of precision technology, as well as the opportunity for further   technological developments. We found that the proposed system has   potential to increase agro-ecological sustainability, resilience, and   the overall productivity of this three-year rotation.

However, the potential   interference of parasite infections on suspension feeding is not well   investigated. We experimentally determined the effect of infections with   metacercariae of the common trematode Renicola roscovita on clearance   rates and condition of blue mussels Mytilus edulis. We also investigated   whether there were differences in the effects of infections between   different size classes of mussels. Using controlled infections under lab   conditions, our experiment showed that infections significantly reduced   the clearance rates of mussels. This effect was less pronounced in small   (42\% reduction) than in large mussels (71\%). In addition, infections   significantly reduced mussel body mass index in large (23\% reduction)   and small (17\%) mussels compared to uninfected mussels. These   reductions most likely resulted from a combined effect of an   interference of the parasites with the mussel's feeding apparatus (with   the palps being the preferred infection site of the parasite) and of the   energetic demands of the parasites (with metacercariae growing in size   after initial infection). These negative effects on mussel filter   feeding capacity indicate that parasites can alter a crucially important   functional trait of marine suspension feeders.",42,MAYBE,IF,"mussel clearance rate, BMI",YES,,,

One of the largest   sources of nutrient pollution comes from anthropogenic alteration of the   nitrogen (N) cycle, specifically the increased rate of nitrate (NO3 -N)   deposition to aquatic environments, potentially altering host-parasite   relationships. This study aimed to assess the mechanisms through which   nitrate may impact host-pathogen relationships using a fungal pathogen   (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) parasitic to crustacean zooplankton (Daphnia   dentifera) as a tractable model system. First, the influence of nitrate   on host population dynamics was assessed along a gradient of nitrate   concentrations. Nitrate decreased host population size and increased   infection prevalence. Second, the influence of nitrate on host   reproduction, mortality, and infection intensity was assessed at the   individual host level by examining the relationship between pathogen   dose and infection prevalence at ambient (0.4mgNO(3) -N*L-1) and   intermediate (12mgNO(3) -N*L-1) levels of nitrate. Host fecundity and   infection intensity both decreased with increasing pathogen dose, but   increased nitrate levels corresponded to greater infection intensities.   Nitrate had no effect on host growth rate, suggesting that hosts do not   alter feeding behavior in nitrate-treated media compared with ambient   conditions. This study suggests that nutrient enrichment may enhance   disease through increased transmission and infection intensity, but that   high levels of nitrate may result in smaller epidemics through reduced   transmission caused by smaller population sizes and increased pathogen   mortality.",43,NO,IF,host fedundity,,,,

In addition to such services, plantation forests provide   direct and indirect benefits to biodiversity via the provision of forest   habitat for a wide range of species, and by reducing negative impacts on   natural forests by offsetting the need to extract resources. There is   compelling evidence that climate change is directly affecting   biodiversity in forests throughout the world. These impacts occur as a   result of changes in temperature, rainfall, storm frequency and   magnitude, fire frequency, and the frequency and magnitude of pest and   disease outbreaks. However, in plantation forests it is not only the   direct effects of climate change that will impact on biodiversity.   Climate change will have strong indirect effects on biodiversity in   plantation forests via changes in forest management actions that have   been proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the   productive capacity of plantations. These include changes in species   selection (including use of species mixtures), rotation length,   thinning, pruning, extraction of bioenergy feedstocks, and large scale   climate change driven afforestation, reforestation, and, potentially   deforestation. By bringing together the potential direct and indirect   impacts of climate change we conclude that in the short to medium term   changes in plantation management designed to mitigate or adapt to   climate change could have a significantly greater impact on biodiversity   in such plantation forests than the direct effects of climate change.   Although this hypothesis remains to be formally tested, forest managers   worldwide are already considering new approaches to plantation forestry   in an effort to create forests that are more resilient to the effects of   changing climatic conditions. Such change presents significant risks to   existing biodiversity values in plantation forests, however it also   provides new opportunities to improve biodiversity values within   existing and new plantation forests.

However, it is unclear   whether restoration of biodiverse habitat can reverse this effect, and   what role the environmental microbiome might have in such recovery.   Here, we propose the Microbiome Rewilding Hypothesis, which specifically   outlines that restoring biodiverse habitats in urban green spaces can   rewild the environmental microbiome to a state that enhances primary   prevention of human disease. We support our hypothesis with examples   from allied fields, including a case study of active restoration that   reversed the degradation of the soil bacterial microbiome of a former   pasture. This case study used high-throughput amplicon sequencing of   environmental DNA to assess the quality of a restoration intervention in   restoring the soil bacterial microbiome. The method is rapid, scalable,   and standardizable, and has great potential as a monitoring tool to   assess functional outcomes of green-space restoration.

Stability for all values of the reproduction rate   R of the host requires the distribution to be skewed, with a modal risk   of zero. As a consequence, a distribution of risk with nonzero mode but   otherwise sufficiently high variability will not stabilize the   host-parasitoid equilibrium for certain values of R.   We also develop a new, simple, and general criterion for stability,   according to which the host-parasitoid equilibrium is stable if and only   if the adult host equilibrium density increases as host reproductive   rate R increases. This reinforces previous results that skewed risk of   the type needed for stability reduces parasitoid efficiency and hence   the parasitoid's ability to suppress the host.

In semi-arid rangelands of Australia, invasive cane toads   (Rhinella marina) prey on dung beetles that were themselves introduced   to promote nutrient cycling and reduce parasite burdens of livestock.   Cane toads' colonization of rangelands has been facilitated by   artificial water points (AWP) which provide cattle with drinking water.   Most AWP in northern Australia comprise bores that pump water into   earthen reservoirs (dams). Dams typically support large toad populations   because they allow toads' access to water without which they could not   survive. Here, we ask if restricting toads' access to water at AWP can   reduce toad populations, toads' predatory impact on dung beetles, and   the rate of dung decomposition by dung beetles. We contrasted toad and   dung beetle populations, toad diets, and dung removal rates at AWP   fitted with dams or tanks as reservoirs. In comparison to dams, tanks   provide toads with little access to water. Population densities of toads   were five times higher at dams than tanks. Conversely, population   densities of dung beetles were 12 times lower at dams than tanks. Mass   loss of experimental dung pats after 2 days was 13\% greater at tanks   than dams. Our study provides evidence that consumption of detritivores   by an introduced predator can retard dung decomposition in a rangeland   ecosystem.

Human activities can add to these   changes, as penguins are sensitive to anthropic impacts such as   contamination. Our objective was to assess whether selected   physiological parameters of Adelie and Gentoo penguins reflect their   contrasting population trends in a colony located at Punta Stranger (25   de Mayo Island/King George, South Shetland Islands) where they breed   sympatrically.

Higher values of ENAs, indicative of genotoxic damage caused by   contaminants, are in accordance with a greater sensitivity to ongoing   global changes by Adelie penguins. Levels of cholesterol and   triglycerides strengthen this idea since individuals could be investing   more resources in energy reserves to successfully cope with challenging   environmental conditions during the breeding season.

Analysis of shared spaces   indicated that 5.5\% of human space overlapped with primate spaces,   while 69.5\% of primate spaces overlapped with human spaces. Nearest   neighbor analysis indicated that human activities were significantly   spatially clustered within and around individual fragments, as were   primate locations. Getis-Ord statistics revealed statistically   significant ``hotspots'' of human activity and primate activity, but   only one location where spatial overlap between humans and primates was   statistically significant. Human activities associated with collecting   fuelwood and other forest products were the primary drivers of   human-primate overlap; however, primates also spent time outside of   forest fragments in agricultural spaces. These results demonstrate that   fragmented landscapes are not uniform with respect to human-primate   overlap, and that the implications of human-primate interaction, such as   primate population declines and possible cross-species disease   transmission, are spatially aggregated.",52,NO,IF,,,,,

Ecological stoichiometry provides a framework for placing parasites in   an ecosystem perspective by considering elemental imbalances and their   consequences. I measured the elemental content of trematodes and their   gastropod hosts and then estimated the nutrient-recycling effects of   parasitism. N:P of all tissue types in trematodes of the freshwater   pulmonate snail, Physa acuta, was similar to N:P of gastropod gonadal   tissue. However, N:P of trematodes and gastropod gonads was lower than   N:P of other gastropod tissues, a result suggesting an elemental   imbalance between parasite and host. N:P of excreta of P. acuta   increased with the N:P content of their algal food, consistent with   consumer-driven nutrient recycling theory. However, gastropods with   patent infections of Trichobilharzia physellae excreted greater N:P than   did uninfected snails, a result indicating that infected and uninfected   gastropods were functionally different.

The UK State is   developing policy strategies to tackle these public health problems   alongside intergovernmental responses. However, the governance of food   supply chains is conducted by, and across, both private and public   spheres and within a multilevel framework. The realities of contemporary   food governance are that private interests are key drivers of food   supply chains and have institutionalized a great deal of   standards-setting and quality, notably from their locations in the   downstream and midstream sectors. The UK State is designing some   downstream and some midstream interventions to ameliorate the public   health impacts of current food consumption patterns in England. The UK   State has not addressed upstream interventions towards public health   diet at the primary food production and processing stages, although   traditionally it has shaped agricultural policy. Within the realities of   contemporary multilevel governance, the UK State must act within the   contexts set by the international regimes of the Common Agricultural   Policy and the World Trade Organization agreements, notably on   agriculture.

It is causing ongoing, severe population   decline of the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), the largest   surviving marsupial carnivore and there are concerns that DFTD may lead   to extinction of the devil. Whether extinction is likely depends on   contact rates and their relationship to host density. We investigated   contact rates using two different datasets. The first consisted of field   observations of contact and biting behaviour around prey carcasses and,   the second was a 3-year longitudinal series of injuries in a marked   devil population. During feeding interactions at carcasses, contact   rates were significantly positively associated with population density   and subadults delivered more bites than adult males and females.   Injuries from the marked devil population did not differ between adult   males and females. In two of the three years, penetrating biting   (resulting in injury) increased markedly during the mating season and   was more frequent in adults than in subadults. Among injured devils with   wounds penetrating the dermal layer, adults were more frequently bitten   in the head (the location of primary tumours) in the mating season than   in other seasons, and had more head bites than subadults. Our results   suggest that the mating season may be the key period for disease   transmission. If most penetrating bites occur during mating   interactions, DFTD transmission is likely to be frequency dependent,   which means that there would be no threshold host density for disease   persistence, and disease-induced extinction is possible.",55,NO,IF,,,,,

Yet, we know surprisingly little about microbial community   dynamics and the stability of host-microbe associations under adverse   environmental conditions. To gain insight into the stability of coral   host-microbe associations and holobiont structure, we assessed changes   in the community structure of Symbiodinium and bacteria associated with   the coral Pocillopora verrucosa under excess organic nutrient   conditions. Pocillopora-associated microbial communities were monitored   over 14days in two independent experiments. We assessed the effect of   excess dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and excess dissolved organic   carbon (DOC). Exposure to excess nutrients rapidly affected coral   health, resulting in two distinct stress phenotypes: coral bleaching   under excess DOC and severe tissue sloughing (>90\% tissue loss   resulting in host mortality) under excess DON. These phenotypes were   accompanied by structural changes in the Symbiodinium community. In   contrast, the associated bacterial community remained remarkably stable   and was dominated by two Endozoicomonas phylotypes, comprising on   average 90\% of 16S rRNA gene sequences. This dominance of   Endozoicomonas even under conditions of coral bleaching and mortality   suggests the bacterial community of P.verrucosa may be rather inflexible   and thereby unable to respond or acclimatize to rapid changes in the   environment, contrary to what was previously observed in other corals.   In this light, our results suggest that coral holobionts might occupy   structural landscapes ranging from a highly flexible to a rather   inflexible composition with consequences for their ability to respond to   environmental change.",56,NO,IF,,,,,

Using   observations and experiments to investigate the consequences of such   declines are hampered because trees are long-lived. Simulation models   can provide a means to forecast possible futures based on different   scenarios of tree species decline, death, and removal. Such modeling is   particularly urgent for species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga   canadensis), a foundation species in many northeastern forest regions   that is declining due to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae).   Here, we used an individual-based forest simulator, SORTIE-ND, to   forecast changes in forest communities in Central Massachusetts over the   next 200 yr under a range of scenarios: a no-adelgid, status quo   scenario; partial resistance of hemlock to the adelgid; adelgid   irruption and total hemlock decline over 25 yr, adelgid irruption and   salvage logging of hemlock trees; and two scenarios of preemptive   logging of hemlock and hemlock/white pine. We applied the model to six   study plots comprising a range of initial species mixtures, abundances,   and levels of hemlock dominance. Simulations indicated that eastern   white pine, and to a lesser extent black birch and American beech, would   gain most in relative abundance and basal area following hemlock   decline. The relative dominance of these species depended on initial   conditions and the amount of hemlock mortality, and their combined   effect on neighborhood-scale community dynamics. Simulated outcomes were   little different whether hemlock died out gradually due to the adelgid   or disappeared rapidly following logging. However, if eastern hemlock   were to become partially resistant to the adelgid, hemlock would be able   to retain its dominance despite substantial losses of basal area. Our   modeling highlights the complexities associated with secondary forest   succession due to ongoing hemlock decline and loss. We emphasize the   need both for a precautionary approach in deciding between management   intervention or simply doing nothing in these declining hemlock forests,   and for clear aims and understanding regarding desired community- and   ecosystem-level outcomes.",57,NO,IF,,,,,

However, how these feedbacks depend on   the soil environment remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that   disintegrating a naturally aggregated soil may influence the outcome of   PSF by affecting microbial communities. Furthermore, we expected plants   to differentially interact with soil structure and the microbial   communities due to varying root morphology. We carried out a feedback   experiment with nine plant species (five forbs and four grasses) where   the training phase consisted of aggregated versus disintegrated soil. In   the feedback phase, a uniform soil was inoculated in a fully factorial   design with soil washings from conspecific- versus   heterospecific-trained soil that had been either disintegrated or   aggregated. This way, the effects of prior soil structure on plant   performance in terms of biomass production and allocation were examined.   In the training phase, soil structure did not affect plant biomass. But   on disintegrated soil, plants with lower specific root length (SRL)   allocated more biomass aboveground. PSF in the feedback phase was   negative overall. With training on disintegrated soil, conspecific   feedback was positively correlated with SRL and significantly differed   between grasses and forbs. Plants with higher SRL were likely able to   easily explore the disintegrated soil with smaller pores, while plants   with lower SRL invested in belowground biomass for soil exploration and   seemed to be more susceptible to fungal pathogens. This suggests that   plants with low SRL could be more limited by PSF on disintegrated soils   of early successional stages. This study is the first to examine the   influence of soil structure on PSF. Our results suggest that soil   structure determines the outcome of PSF mediated by SRL.

Here we examine responses of algal primary   producers to tadpole extirpation over differing spatial and temporal   scales. We experimentally excluded tadpoles from artificial substrata   within localized areas (0.25 m(2)) of two streams. One stream had an   intact community of frogs (frog stream), and the other had recently   experienced a catastrophic decline (frogless stream), leaving virtually   no tadpoles. In the frog stream, there were significantly greater levels   of chlorophyll a (+111\%, P = 0.009), ash-free dry mass (AFDM) (+163\%,   P = 0.02), inorganic sediments (+114\%, P = 0.001), and higher mean   algal cell biovolume in tadpole exclusion treatments than in the tadpole   access treatments.

Areal-specific NPP   did not differ between treatments. There were no significant differences   in chlorophyll a, AFDM, inorganic sediments, algal cell biovolume, or   biomass-specific NPP between treatments in the frogless stream. Fifteen   months after our experiments, a massive amphibian decline associated   with a fungal pathogen occurred in the frog stream, resulting in the   extirpation of over 90\% of tadpoles. This extirpation was followed by   significant increases in levels of chlorophyll a (269\%, P = 0.001),   AFDM (+220\%, P < 0.001), and inorganic sediments (+140\%, P = 0.001).

The slopes of the power-law distribution of the   cluster-size P(CS >= c) and of the SAR vary for each taxi and   life-stages underlying different spatial organization. A clear   relationship exists between the slope z of the SAR and the slope 6 of   P(CS >= c), that is dependent on the ecosystem topology and shape, and   on the dispersal kernel function. The heterogeneity of the environmental   features leads to the formation of smaller clusters than in the ideal   homogeneous scenario. P(CS >= cs) declines to an exponential   distribution in dispersal-limited scenarios for which the effect of the   environmental heterogeneities is stronger, the probability distribution   of the local and pairwise species richness similarity is a lognormal   function and the occupancy-rank is concave upward. The clustering of   species has been studied on other real and artificial river networks and   on 2-D non-fragmented landscapes. River networks have smaller clusters   than 2-D landscapes for the same ecological dispersal scenario however   the range in which P(CS >= c) holds is larger. The higher the elongation   of the ecosystem the bigger the LSR, and the smaller the mean   cluster-size. River networks due to the larger link-diameter than 2-D   landscapes with the same domain are potentially more robust ecosystems,   for example against invasion of invasive/exotic species and pathogens.   The ecological ratio between the mean dispersal parameter and the   average diameter is introduced as useful tool to compare biodiversity   patterns.

The Jena   Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant   diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a   multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of   research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of   manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With   more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena   Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for   functional biodiversity research.   First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness   is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an   ecosystem. About 45\% of different types of ecosystem processes measured   in the `main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to   60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness,   providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant   driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at   the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of   species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength   of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that   many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years   to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that   biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends   from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena   Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for   example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly   some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities   experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This   highlights the need to revisit diversity-stability theory.   Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant   functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for   ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong   effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass   production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not   instead of, effects of plant species richness.   Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on   multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded   positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was   stronger for above-than for belowground organisms, and stronger for   herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets   diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger   than the effect on species abundances.   Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on   N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating   between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element   stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less   affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover   and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g.   carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species   richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant   species richness than variables of the C cycle.   Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment,   most investigated plant traits, both above-and belowground, were plastic   and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way,   suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits   to particular functions.   Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused   by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena   Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex   interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and   greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and   activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation   experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground   invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments,   supported the important role of the biotic component for element and   water fluxes.   Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context   of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of   increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass   was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive   grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency.   Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to   that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that   diverse `High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can   deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related   services.   A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding   of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the   effort ( in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to   plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of   ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture   performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of   biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments.   To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive   analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main   challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our   mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects   differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no   simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested   to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some   have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical   root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in   targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena   Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect   results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse   communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant   growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait   differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake.   Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of   competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that   predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible.   (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this study, we assessed how temperature influences the interplay   between the main genetic clades of this prominent microalga and their   viruses. The growth of three Micromonas strains (Mic-A, Mic-B, Mic-C)   and the stability of their respective lytic viruses (MicV-A, MicV-B,   MicV-C) were measured over a thermal range of 4-32.5 degrees C. Similar   growth temperature optima (T-opt) were predicted for all three hosts but   Mic-B exhibited a broader thermal tolerance than Mic-A and Mic-C,   suggesting distinct thermoacclimation strategies. Similarly, the MicV-C   virus displayed a remarkable thermal stability compared with MicV-A and   MicV-B. Despite these divergences, infection dynamics showed that   temperatures below T-opt lengthened lytic cycle kinetics and reduced   viral yield and, notably, that infection at temperatures above T-opt did   not usually result in cell lysis. Two mechanisms operated depending on   the temperature and the biological system. Hosts either prevented the   production of viral progeny or maintained their ability to produce   virions with no apparent cell lysis, pointing to a possible switch in   the viral life strategy.

A loss of natural enemies, such as parasites, is   one mechanism proposed to contribute to that success. While several   studies have shown NIS are initially less parasitized than native   conspecifics, fewer studies have investigated whether parasite richness   changes over time. Moreover, evaluating the role that parasites have in   invaded communities requires not only an understanding of the parasite   diversity of NIS but also the species with which they interact; yet   parasite diversity in native species may be inadequately quantified. In   our study, we examined parasite taxonomic richness, infection   prevalence, and infection intensity in the invasive Asian shore crab   Hemigrapsus sanguineus De Haan, 1835 and two native mud crabs (Panopeus   herbstii Milne-Edwards, 1834 and Eurypanopeus depressus Smith, 1869) in   estuarine and coastal communities along the east coast of the USA.

Our study   finds some evidence for lower infection prevalence in the non-native   versus the native hosts. However, we also demonstrate that parasite   escape can lessen with time.

Method C simultaneously assessed ecosystem functions and species use,   allowing trade-offs between supporting ecosystem function and species   use to be identified. Using Method C to develop hypothetical scenarios   of different tree species mixtures showed that prioritising ecosystem   function and then increasing the mixture of tree species to support the   greatest number of ash-associated species possible, results in a mixture   of trees more ecologically similar to F. excelsior than by simply mixing   tree species together to support the greatest number of ash-associated   species. We conclude that establishing alternative tree species results   in changes in both ecosystem function and species supported and have   developed a general method to assess suitability that simultaneously   integrates both ecosystem function and the `number of species   supported'.",65,NO,IF,,,,,

The smallholder farmers are resource constrained   and unable to afford expensive chemicals for crop protection. The   push-pull technology, a chemical ecology- based cropping system, is   developed for integrated pest and weed management in cereal-livestock   farming systems. Appropriate plants were selected that naturally emit   signaling chemicals (semiochemicals). Plants highly attractive for   stemborer egg laying were selected and employed as trap crops (pull), to   draw pests away from the main crop. Plants that repelled stemborer   females were selected as intercrops (push). The stemborers are attracted   to the trap plant, and are repelled from the main cereal crop using a   repellent intercrop (push). Root exudates of leguminous repellent   intercrops also effectively control the parasitic striga weed through an   allelopathic mechanism. Their root exudates contain flavonoid compounds   some of which stimulate germination of Striga hermonthica seeds, such as   Uncinanone B, and others that dramatically inhibit their attachment to   host roots, such as Uncinanone C and a number of di-C-glycosylflavones   (di-CGFs), resulting in suicidal germination. The intercrop also   improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, natural mulching,   improved biomass, and control of erosion. Both companion plants provide   high value animal fodder, facilitating milk production and diversifying   farmers' income sources. The technology is appropriate to smallholder   mixed cropping systems in Africa. Adopted by about 125,000 farmers to   date in eastern Africa, it effectively addresses major production   constraints, significantly increases maize yields, and is economical as   it is based on locally available plants, not expensive external inputs.",66,NO,IF,,,,,

The emerald ash borer (Agrilus   planipennis Fairmaire) is a phloem feeding beetle that was inadvertently   introduced to the US in the 1990s and relies solely on ash trees   (Fraxinus spp.) to complete its life cycle. Ash trees have a wide   geographic distribution and are an important component of many different   forest types in the US. The larval feeding behavior of the emerald ash   borer (EAB) effectively girdles the tree's phloem tissue resulting in   tree mortality in as little as 2 years and stand mortality in as little   as 5 years. Using the forest inventory and analysis database, we found   that forest lands in the lower 48 states hold approximately 8.7 billion   ash trees and saplings, which represent similar to 2.5 \% of the   aboveground forest carbon mass. Furthermore, we measured tree growth in   7 EAB impacted and 5 non-EAB impacted temperate forests in the   Midwestern United States to quantify the impacts of EAB induced tree   mortality on tree growth. We hypothesized that the initial C lost would   be partly compensated for by the enhanced non-ash tree growth in   EAB-impacted regions relative to non-EAB impacted regions. The EAB   disturbance enhanced growth of non-ash trees in the EAB impacted region   relative to the non-EAB impacted region. Results also indicate that in   EAB impacted areas, growth of trees from the genera Acer and Ulmus   responded most positively. Finally, we quantified annual biometric net   primary productivity of the EAB impacted forests and compared these   quantities to modeled growth of these forests in the absence of EAB and   found that large scale ash tree mortality has reduced short term   regional forest productivity. The loss of ash biometric net primary   productivity is, in part compensated by enhanced growth of non-ash   species. As expected, EAB disturbance severity was greater in forests   with higher basal areas of ash. This study illustrates the ecosystem and   regional scale impacts of invasive pest-induced disturbance on   biogeochemical cycling and forest species composition.",68,NO,IF,,,,,

We examined the importance   of local density of sea urchins and pre-existing gaps in a kelp canopy   in mediating the formation of destructive grazing aggregations of sea   urchins in a kelp bed. We transplanted 14 000 adult sea urchins from a   barrens on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia into similar to 4.5 m(2)   plots within a nearby kelp bed, at densities above and below a predicted   threshold value for destructive grazing, and simulated disturbance to   the kelp bed by removing the kelp canopy in half of the plots.   Sea-urchin abundance and gap formation and expansion (as loss of kelp   canopy cover) were monitored in and around plots weekly for 9 wk.

P-J vegetation is spatially   extensive, thus large-scale mortality events such as the one that has   occurred over the past several years could significantly alter regional   carbon (C) budgets. Our objective was to use a remote sensing technique   coupled with field-based data to estimate changes in aboveground live C   stocks across a 4100 km(2) region of Colorado caused by P-J tree   mortality. We hypothesized that dieback would amplify the phenological   dynamics of P-J vegetation, and these variations would be related to   drought-induced losses of live P-J aboveground biomass (AGB) that are   discernible using time-series remote sensing vegetation data. Here, we   assess live P-J AGB loss using dry season fractional photosynthetic   vegetation cover (PV) derived from multi-year Landsat images. Our   results showed a strong linear positive relationship between the maximum   decline in PV and field-measured losses of live P-J AGB during the   period 2000-05 (r(2) = 0.64, p = 0.002). These results were then used to   map AGB losses throughout the study region. Mean live aboveground C loss   (+/- sd) was 10.0 (+/- 3.4) Mg C ha(-1). Total aboveground live P-J C   loss was 4.6 Tg C. which was approximately 39 times higher than the   concurrent C loss attributed to wildfire and management treatments   within or near to the national forests of the study region. Our results   suggest that spatially extensive mortality events such as the one   observed in P-J woodlands across the western US in the past decade may   significantly alter the ecosystem C balance for decades to come.

No ectomycorrhizal infection was observed on   either kanuka or manuka in samples examined under binocular microscope.   The biomass response by kanuka to inoculation may be due to introduction   of more effective arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from kanuka communities   or possibly to the introduction of soil microorganisms.

However, positive soil feedback may also be due to enhanced benefit from   the local arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Few studies actually have   tested pathogen effects, and none of them did so in arid savannas. In   the Kalahari savanna in Botswana, we compared the soil feedback of the   exotic grass Cenchrus biflorus with that of two dominant native grasses,   Eragrostis lehmanniana and Aristida meridionalis. The exotic grass had   neutral to positive soil feedback, whereas both native grasses showed   neutral to negative feedback effects.   Isolation and testing of root-inhabiting fungi of E. lehmanniana yielded   two host-specific pathogens that did not influence the exotic C.   biflorus or the other native grass, A. meridionalis. None of the grasses   was affected by the fungi that were isolated from the roots of the   exotic C. biflorus. We isolated and compared the AMF community of the   native and exotic grasses by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing   gradient gel elecrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), targeting AMF 18S rRNA. We used   roots from monospecific field stands and from plants grown in pots with   mixtures of soils from the monospecific field stands. Three-quarters of   the root samples of the exotic grass had two nearly identical sequences,   showing 99\% similarity with Glomus versiforme. The two native grasses   were also associated with distinct bands, but each of these bands   occurred in only a fraction of the root samples. The native grasses   contained a higher diversity of AMF bands than the exotic grass.   Canonical correspondence analyses of the AMF band patterns revealed   almost as much difference between the native and exotic grasses as   between the native grasses.   In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that release from   soil-borne enemies may facilitate local abundance of exotic plants, and   we provide the first evidence that these processes may occur in arid   savanna ecosystems.

In freshwater and marine environments, parasites   play a crucial role in controlling plankton population dynamics.   Infection of phytoplankton populations will cause a transfer of carbon   and nutrients into parasites, which may change the type of food   available for higher trophic levels. Some phytoplankton species are   inedible to zooplankton, and the termination of their population by   parasites may liberate otherwise unavailable carbon and nutrients.   Phytoplankton spring blooms often consist of large diatoms inedible for   zooplankton, but the zoospores of their fungal parasites may serve as a   food source for this higher trophic level. Here, we investigated the   impact of warming on the fungal infection of a natural phytoplankton   spring bloom and followed the response of a zooplankton community.   Experiments were performed in ca. 1000L indoor mesocosms exposed to a   controlled seasonal temperature cycle and a warm (+4 degrees C)   treatment in the period from March to June 2014. The spring bloom was   dominated by the diatom Synedra. At the peak of infection over 40\% of   the Synedra population was infected by a fungal parasite (i.e. a   chytrid) in both treatments. Warming did not affect the onset of the   Synedra bloom, but accelerated its termination. Peak population density   of Synedra tended to be lower in the warm treatments. Furthermore,   Synedra carbon: phosphorus stoichiometry increased during the bloom,   particularly in the control treatments. This indicates enhanced   phosphorus limitation in the control treatments, which may have   constrained chytrid development. Timing of the rotifer Keratella   advanced in the warm treatments and closely followed chytrid infections.   The chytrids' zoospores may thus have served as an alternative food   source to Keratella. Our study thus emphasizes the importance of   incorporating not only nutrient limitation and grazing, but also   parasitism in understanding the response of plankton communities towards   global warming.",75,MAYBE,IF,"Synedra carbon: phosphorus stoichiometry increased during the bloom, particularly in the control treatments",no,data on PP but not on ecosystem processes affected by PP,,"PP as outcome variable, may have been food for rotifers (time-course)"

It has erect,   branched stems and pinnately lobed leaves. Spike-like racemes of male   capitula composed of staminate (male) florets terminate the stems, while   cyme-like clusters of pistillate (female) florets are arranged in groups   in the axils of main and lateral stem leaves. Seeds require prolonged   chilling to break dormancy. Following seedling emergence in spring, the   rate of vegetative growth depends on temperature, but development occurs   over a wide thermal range. In temperate European climates, male and   female flowers are produced from summer to early autumn (July to   October).Ambrosia artemisiifolia is sensitive to freezing. Late spring   frosts kill seedlings and the first autumn frosts terminate the growing   season. It has a preference for dry soils of intermediate to rich   nutrient level.Ambrosia artemisiifolia was introduced into Europe with   seed imports from North America in the 19th century. Since World War II,   it has become widespread in temperate regions of Europe and is now   abundant in open, disturbed habitats as a ruderal and agricultural weed.   Recently, the North American ragweed leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) has   been detected in southern Switzerland and northern Italy. This species   appears to have the capacity to substantially reduce growth and seed   production of A.artemisiifolia. In heavily infested regions of Europe,   A.artemisiifolia causes substantial crop-yield losses and its copious,   highly allergenic pollen creates considerable public health problems.   There is a consensus among models that climate change will allow its   northward and uphill spread in Europe.",79,NO,IF,,,,,

The present study measured wasting disease in   natural populations of Z. marina on the Swedish west coast, and showed a   strong correlation between the disease and both salinity and water   depth. No infection was detected in Z. marina shoots from low-salinity   (13-25 PSU) meadows, whereas most shoots carried the disease in   high-salinity (25-29 PSU) meadows. Shallow (1 m) living Z. marina shoots   were also more infected compared to shoots in deeper (5 m) meadows. In   addition, infection and transplantation experiments showed that Z.   marina shoots from low-salinity meadows with low pathogen pressure were   more susceptible to L. zosterae infection. The higher susceptibility   could not be explained by lower content of inhibitory defense compounds   in the shoots. Instead, extracts from all Z. marina shoots significantly   reduced pathogen growth, suggesting that Z. marina contains inhibitory   compounds that function as a constitutive defense. Overall, the results   show that seagrass wasting disease is common in natural Z. marina   populations in the study area and that it increases with salinity and   decreases with depth. Our findings also suggest that low-salinity areas   can act as a refuge against seagrass wasting disease.",80,NO,IF,,,,,

These pressures, which differ in their   biotic or abiotic nature and their spatiotemporal scales, can interact   in nonadditive ways (synergistically or antagonistically), but are   rarely considered together in studies of pollinator and/or pollination   decline.

M. arvense was grown at two nutrient levels with 27 host species   (grasses, legumes, and forbs) from habitats differing in nutrient   availability. The biomass of the parasite varied enormously (475-fold)   depending on the host species. The mean fraction of parasite biomass   allocated to roots (RMF) decreased with increasing quality of a host   (measured as total biomass of the parasite) and was only 3\% with the   best host. An extensive review of published studies showed that access   to a host in most cases reduces RMF of root hemiparasites and that the   RMF of annual root hemiparasites is low compared to that of autotrophic   plants, suggesting that a reduced expenditure on roots is an important   advantage of hemiparasitism for annual parasites. In contrast, the RMF   of hemiparasitic perennial herbs and woody plants was found to be   similar to that of autotrophic plants.   Host identity and nutrients also strongly influenced traits of M.   arvense other than biomass, e.g. leaf size, seed mass, leaf chlorophyll   concentration, nitrogen concentration, height, and the number of   vegetative internodes. However, while host plant identity influenced   allometric relationships, most of the effects of nutrient level were due   to simple changes in overall parasite size. Individual parasite biomass   was not correlated with the final shoot or root mass of the host plants   growing in the same pot, but increased weakly with host nitrogen   concentration. Mean host size at the time of parasite planting, host   functional type and the nutrient state of the typical host habitat   influenced mean parasite biomass and together explained 64\% of its   variation. Parasite growth increased with initial host mass, was higher   with legumes and forbs than with grasses, and higher with hosts from   nutrient-rich habitats.   Host damage due to parasitism increased with mean biomass of the   parasite, and was lower for fast-growing species and higher for legumes   and forbs than for grasses. Differences in damage between similarly good   hosts indicated that not only resistance but also tolerance may be   important for host responses to parasitism. M. arvense also caused   changes in host allometry and increased host RMF, particularly in good   host species. However, an extensive literature review found that there   is no consistent general pattern of a higher RMF in hosts that are   parasitized. Total productivity per pot was reduced by parasite presence   suggesting lower resource use efficiency of the parasite, but not for   all parasite - host combinations. Patterns of host quality for M.   arvense and for its impact on host species differed strongly from those   found for the related model hemiparasite Rhinanthus and suggest that   hemiparasite - host species interactions may be parasite-specific.

To test how plant functional groups (FGs:   graminoids, small herbs, tall herbs, legumes) and plant traits relate to   PSF, we grew 48 grassland species in sterilized soil, sterilized soil   with own species soil inoculum and sterilized soil with soil inoculum   from all species, and quantified relative growth rate (RGR), specific   leaf area (SLA), specific root length (SRL) and per cent arbuscular   mycorrhizal fungi colonization (\%AMF). Plant growth response to the   plant species' own soil biota relative to sterilized soil   (PSFsterilized) reflects net effects of all (generalist+specialized)   soil biota. Growth response to the plant species' own soil biota   relative to soil biota of all plant species (PSFaway) reveals effects of   more specialized soil organisms. PSFsterilized showed that graminoids   and small herbs have a negative and tall herbs a positive response to   their own soil biota, whereas legumes responded neutrally. However,   PSFaway showed that on average, all plant FGs benefitted from growing   with other species' soil biota, suggesting that pathogens are more   specialized than plant growth-promoting soil biota. Feedback to plant   growth from all soil biota (PSFsterilized) was stronger than from more   specialized soil biota (PSFaway) and could be predicted by SRL and   especially by \%AMF colonization. Species with high SRL and low \%AMF   colonization when grown in away soil experienced most negative soil   feedback.Synthesis. Plant species from all plant FGs grow better in soil   from other species because of less net negative effects of soil biota   (in graminoids), or because of more net positive soil biota effects (in   tall herbs). Explorative plant species (high SRL, low \%AMF   colonization) suffer most from negative feedback of all soil biota,   whereas more resource conservative species (low SRL, high \%AMF   colonization) benefit from soil feedback of all soil biota. These   findings help to understand replacement of explorative species during   succession.

In this   framework, a mesocosm-scale trial was carried out to test the capacity   of different helophyte species to reduce the excess of water in an   artificial pond filled with oversaturated sludge.   The sludge derives from the digestion of pig slurries, presents high   levels of zinc and copper and for most of the year is covered by a water   layer of about 20 cm due to rainfalls. This layout (water layer over the   sludge) was reproduced inside the mesocosms, where four helophyte   species (Phragmites australis and a mix of Carex acutiformis, Iris   pseudacorus and Juncus effusus) were planted on floating frames. Plant   growth and functionality were monitored for one year, along with their   water consumption capacity; the vegetation impact on sludge chemistry,   sludge microbial community and sludge greenhouse gases emission/uptake   were also evaluated. The sensitivity of the phyto-dehydration system to   the reduction of water level occurring during summer in the pond was   investigated reducing the water input to the mesocosms.   P. australis and C. acutiformis successfully established in the   mesocosms, while a significant mortality was recorded for I. psudacorus   and J. effusus. Once established, plants were able to grow in the   mesocosms, and no metal toxicity effect was observed on photosynthesis   rates that were comparable with values reported for natural stands of   the species. Plants significantly increased (from 24 to 63\%, depending   on the species) the amount of water lost by the mesocosms and   counteracted the reduction of sludge organic carbon that could lead to a   mobilization of the heavy metals bound to organic matter: furthermore,   plants decreased the rates of mesocosm greenhouse gas emission and   reduced the sludge pathogen (Enterobacteriaceae) occurrence. Water   limitations reversibly reduced the water consumption and CO2 uptake   capacity of the mesocosms.   The results of this study demonstrated that the water balance of a   sludge/water system can be effectively modified through the   phyto-dehydration approach, increasing significantly the amount of water   lost.

Our objectives were to determine the impact of rust (caused by   Puccinia silphii) on yield and leaf function in selected Silphium   integrifolium (Asteraceae) plants. We tested the effect of a fungicide   treatment on rust severity and yield, compared the rust infection of   individuals in a population selected for yield, and related this to   chemical changes at the leaf level. We also estimated heritability for   rust resistance. We found that productivity indicators (head number and   weight, leaf weight) and leaf processes (photosynthetic capacity, water   use efficiency) were reduced when silphium leaves and stems were more   heavily infected by P. silphii.

In multitrophic   communities diversity may vary at different trophic levels, with either   synergistic or antagonistic effects on ecosystem functioning.   Intensification of land-use systems is often found to reduce diversity,   which in turn may lead to reduced associated ecological functions in   natural food webs, such as host-parasite interactions. In this study we   investigated the relationship between the number of natural enemy and   host species and the mean rate and temporal variability of parasitism   (inverse of stability), along an intensification gradient of coffee   agroforests in Ecuador. We used standardised trap nests for bees and   wasps and their natural enemies in 14 agroforests, and evaluated these   monthly over a period of 17 months. We found that parasitism rates of   wasps and bees increased with increasing number of enemy species and   decreased with increasing number of host species. Temporal variability   in parasitism rates decreased with increasing number of enemy species   and increased with temporal variability in enemy species richness;   however, these effects were restricted to wasp hosts. Intensification of   agroforests did not significantly affect species richness of hosts or   enemies or their relation to parasitism and its temporal variability. We   conclude that high enemy diversity may enhance parasitism rates and that   high host diversity may provide resistance against consumption.   Furthermore, we show that a diverse and stable enemy community may also   have a stabilizing effect on parasitism rates.

Fish are ideal models for studying the effect of temperature on   immunity, because they are poikilothermic, but possess a complete   vertebrate immune system with both innate and adaptive immunity. We used   three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus) originating from a   stream and a pond, whereby the latter supposedly were adapted to higher   temperature variation. We studied the effect of increasing and   decreasing temperatures and a simulated heat wave with subsequent   recovery on body condition and immune parameters. We hypothesized that   the immune system might be less active at low temperatures, but will be   even more suppressed at temperatures towards the upper tolerable   temperature range. Contrary to our expectation, we found innate and   adaptive immune activity to be highest at a temperature as low as 13   degrees C. Exposure to a simulated heat wave induced long-lasting immune   disorders, in particular in a stickleback population that might be less   adapted to temperature variation in its natural environment.

Parasites can profoundly affect host populations and ecological   communities. Thus, it remains critical to identify mechanisms that drive   variation in epidemics. Resource availability can drive epidemics via   traits of hosts and parasites that govern disease spread.   2. Here, we map resource-trait-epidemic connections to explain variation   in fungal outbreaks (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) in a zooplankton host   (Daphnia dentifera) among lakes. We predicted epidemics would grow   larger in lakes with more phytoplankton via three energetic mechanisms.   First, resources should stimulate Daphnia reproduction, potentially   elevating host density. Secondly, resources should boost body size of   hosts, enhancing exposure to environmentally distributed propagules   through size-dependent feeding. Thirdly, resources should fuel parasite   reproduction within hosts.   3. To test these predictions, we sampled 12 natural epidemics and   tracked edible algae, fungal infection prevalence, body size, fecundity   and density of hosts, as well as within-host parasite loads.   4. Epidemics grew larger in lakes with more algal resources. Structural   equation modelling revealed that resource availability stimulated all   three traits (host fecundity, host size and parasite load). However,   only parasite load connected resources to epidemic size. Epidemics grew   larger in more dense Daphnia populations, but host density was unrelated   to host fecundity (thus breaking its link to resources).   5. Thus, via energetic mechanisms, resource availability can stimulate   key trait(s) governing epidemics in nature.

Due to regulatory constraints that   prevented the use of outdoor plots for our studies, in 2005 we   established multispecies communities in five large cylindrical outdoor   sunlit mesocosms (plastic greenhouses) designed for pollen confinement.   Three of the community members were sexually compatible Brassica spp.:   transgenic glyphosate-resistant canola (B. napus) cultivar (cv.)   RaideRR, glyphosate-sensitive non-transgenic B. napus cv.

In control   mesocosms, the weed D. sanguinalis (crabgrass) began to dominate.

Several dynamic models have shown that dynamics of legumes and   grasses can result in periodic behaviour. These oscillations arise due   to delays in nitrogen flows coupled with differences in ability to   compete for light. However, long-term time series on legume dynamics   that could be used to test predictions of these models are almost   non-existent.   2. We examine legume oscillations in a semi-natural mountain grassland   using a long-term (similar to 30years) data series on aboveground   biomass of individual species and on nitrogen and phosphorus content   over time.   3. Using autocorrelation analysis, we show that there is a strong   periodicity (with period of 8-9years) of legume and grass biomass and   nitrogen content in the grass biomass. These three variables are in   fairly stable phase shifts relative to each other, with a grass peak   followed by a peak in C:N ratio in grasses which is followed by a legume   peak. Phosphorus content in either legume or grass biomass does not show   synchronous cycling with legume or grass biomass or nitrogen content in   grass.   4. Fitting a dynamic linear model to the data showed that legumes affect   nitrogen content in grasses, and grass biomass both affects and is   affected by nitrogen content. In contrast, there is no negative effect   of grasses on legumes, indicating some other process must be responsible   for the legume decline. Manuring, which was occasionally applied to the   plots, also does not seem to affect the cycling. Second-order term for   legumes showed some evidence of self-inhibitory effects in legumes, but   phosphorus content in legumes shows no support for phosphorus   limitation. The most likely explanation of the legume decline should be   sought elsewhere (pathogens, soil biota etc.).   5. Synthesis. Long-term data support the existing the claim that legume   dynamics are the key driver of nitrogen dynamics in nutrient-poor   semi-natural grasslands. Grasses benefit from the nutrient enrichment   due to legume cycling, but are a passive element and do not play a role   in legume limitation. Apart from the role of nutrient cycling, these   legume-driven nutrient dynamics also constitutes processes by which   long-term richness of meadows is maintained.",95,NO,IF,,,,,

We analyzed the assemblages of   arthropods (Arachnida, Collembola, Dermaptera, Psocoptera, Thysanoptera,   Hemiptera, Raphidioptera, Neuroptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera   and Hymenoptera) that emerged from 17,791 Lipara-induced galls collected   in winter from 30 reed beds in the Czech Republic, 15 of which were   situated at (post)industrial sites (gravel-sandpits, tailing ponds,   limestone quarries, colliery dumps, and reclaimed lignite open-cast   mines) and 15 were in near-natural habitats (medieval fishponds, and   river and stream floodplains). The Chao-1 estimator indicated 229.3 +/-   A 18.1 species in reed galls at (post)industrial and 218.1 +/- A 23.6   species at near-natural sites, with the Sorensen index reaching only   0.58. We identified 18 red-listed species and four new species for the   Czech Republic (Gasteruption phragmiticola, Echthrodelphax fairchildii,   Haplogonatopus oratorius and Enclisis sp.), representing mostly obligate   (64 \%) or facultative (9 \%) reed specialists. We propose that Lipara   gall-associated assemblages undergo a long-term cyclic ecological   succession. During first 10 years after reed bed formation, only Lipara   spp. and several other species occur. During next decades, the reed beds   host species-rich assemblages with numerous pioneer species (Singa   nitidula, Polemochartus melas) that critically depend on presence of   prior disturbances. Middle-aged reed beds (near medieval fishponds) are   prevalently enriched in common species only (Oulema duftschmidi,   Dimorphopterus spinolae). Habitats with the longest historical   continuity (river floodplains) host again species-rich assemblages with   several rare species that probably require long-term habitat continuity   (Homalura tarsata, Hylaeus moricei). Landscape dynamics is thus critical   for the persistence of a full spectrum of reed gall inquilines, with   (post)industrials serving as the only refugia for pioneer species ousted   from their key nesting habitats at once cyclically disturbed gravel-sand   river terraces.",96,NO,IF,,,,,

The presence of   these different communities may produce values of abundance, diversity   indices and species richness which do not reflect the changes caused by   the impact of the insecticides in the sprayed area. In this study we   assess the impact of the olive tree management on the arthropod   community and the changes in this community according to the blooming   season. This study has been developed in olive groves subjected to   conventional and organic management regimes by two different approaches:   (a) the abundance-diversity approach, measuring and comparing abundance,   richness and the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') of total arthropods   and per guild and (b) the food-web approach, building food-webs and   comparing their unweighted quantitative descriptors. We sampled the   arthropods in the tree canopy in six conventional and six organic olive   groves (12 plots), and in two of the periods of greatest diversity and   abundance: pre-blooming and post-blooming seasons. The abundance of   total arthropods, but only those within the guild of phytophagous,   diminished significantly when insecticides were used. The species   richness of total arthropods and specifically predators were also   reduced in the conventional plots. These variables were always greater   in organic olive groves. Conversely, the total and per guild   Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') did not detect any management effect   on the olive-canopy arthropod community. Furthermore, all the food-web   unweighted quantitative descriptors such as size, complexity and   prey-predator asymmetries showed the significant effect of the   management on the olive-canopy arthropod community and also presented   greater values in organic olive groves. We also found that the blooming   season did not significantly change the food-web structure, contrary to   what we predicted. However, predator, parasitoid and phytophagous   abundance, total and predator richness were greater in the post-blooming   season. This study shows that the abundance-diversity approach, and   especially H' diversity index, was not useful for describing the effect   of different management systems on the canopy arthropod community. On   the contrary, the food-web approach emerges as a useful tool for   understanding and evaluating the ecological effect of the application of   insecticides (and probably other disturbances during the management)   affecting the agro-ecosystems.",98,NO,IF,,,,,

We experimentally tested the hypothesis that elevated O-3   tends to reduce the nutrition of tomato plants, and to increase the   SA-dependent pathway defenses and the secondary metabolites, and   therefore decrease the population fitness of the whitefly. The results   show that for all three tomato genotypes, elevated O-3 reduced the   soluble sugars and free amino acids, increased the phenylalanine   ammonia-lyase enzyme activity and the accumulated salicylic acid (SA),   and up-regulated the pathogenesis-related protein (PR1), which is   commonly considered to be the whitefly-resistance gene product involved   in SA-dependent defense. Elevated O-3 did not affect the JA level in any   of the three plant genotypes, but it increased the levels of some   secondary metabolites, including total phenolics and condensed tannins.   Elevated O-3 prolonged the developmental time of whiteflies fed on the   three plant genotypes, and it also reduced the fecundity and the   intrinsic rate of increase of whiteflies fed on either the 35S or the   wild-type plants. These results suggest that elevated O-3 reduces the   nutrition of tomato plants and enhances their SA content, relative PR   mRNA expression and secondary metabolism, resulting in decreased fitness   of whiteflies on these tomato plants.",100,NO,IF,,,,,

Vegetation dynamics were studied according to the year of measurement   and the nutrient capacity of the geological bedrock. We used the indices   of floristic similarity, the calculation of plant communities'   characteristics (Shannon-Wiener's index, equitability index), the   calculation of taxa characteristics (fidelity, average cover, constancy)   and multivariate ordination analyses-indirect (DCA) and direct (CCA).

Over 24 years both the nutrient-poor site and the nutrient-rich site   showed a considerable reduction in the tree layer cover and conversely   the advancement of shrub layers. The coverage degree of dominants in the   main tree layer (Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Abies alba) markedly   decreased. Abies alba also exhibited a pronounced drop in constancy. On   the other hand, the lower tree layer and shrub layers in Boubin-Milesice   exhibited a distinctive invasion of Fagus sylvatica.

Methods We have obtained the first direct (14)C ages from the bone   collagen of selected samples of two extinct endemic small mammals from   Mallorca: the Balearic dormouse, Eliomys morpheus (Rodentia: Myoxidae)   and the Balearic shrew, Asoriculus hidalgoi (Soricomorpha: Soricidae).   We also present evidence for the absence of both endemics from the   earliest Mallorcan archaeological sites and for the introduction of the   garden dormouse, Eliomys quercinus, and the wood mouse, Apodemus   sylvaticus. Combined information from direct dating of bone collagen of   E. quercinus and A. sylvaticus and from cultural associations provides   an adequate framework to establish the chronology of the faunal change   and to compare it with the chronological information available on   climatic change and the first arrival of humans on the islands.

Main conclusions Possible causes for the extinction of autochthonous   small mammals on Mallorca are discussed. Once we have discarded climatic   causes, predation by invasive species, competition with newcomers and   habitat deterioration, the introduction of diseases emerges as the most   reasonable explanation for these extinctions.

While the   molecular genetics and evolutionary dynamics of selfish genes are   reasonably well characterized, their effects on hosts are not. Homing   endonuclease genes (HEGs) are one well-studied family of selfish genes   that are assumed to be benign. However, we show that carrying HEGs is   costly for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, demonstrating that these genetic   elements are not necessarily benign but maybe parasitic. We estimate a   selective load of approximately 1-2\% in `natural' niches. The second   aspect we examine is the ability of HEGs to affect hosts' sexual   behaviour. As all selfish genes critically rely on sex for spread, then   any selfish gene correlated with increased host sexuality will enjoy a   transmission advantage. While classic parasites are known to manipulate   host behaviour, we are not aware of any evidence showing a selfish gene   is capable of affecting host promiscuity. The data presented here show a   selfish element may increase the propensity of its eukaryote host to   undergo sex and along with increased rates of non-Mendelian inheritance,   this may counterbalance mitotic selective load and promote spread.   Demonstration that selfish genes are correlated with increased   promiscuity in eukaryotes connects with ideas suggesting that selfish   genes promoted the evolution of sex initially.",106,NO,IF,,,,,

Like shoot-feeding insect herbivores, they exploit a range of chemical   cues to locate host plants. Respiratory emissions of carbon dioxide   (CO2) from the roots is widely reported as the main attractant, however,   there is conflicting evidence about its exact role. CO2 may act as a   `search trigger' causing insects to search more intensively for more   host specific signals, or the plant may `mask' CO2 emissions with other   root volatiles thus avoiding detection. At least 74 other compounds   elicit behavioral responses in root-feeding insects, with the majority   (> 80 \%) causing attraction. Low molecular weight compounds (e.g.,   alcohols, esters, and aldehydes) underpin attraction, whereas   hydrocarbons tend to have repellent properties. A range of compounds act   as phagostimulants (e.g., sugars) once insects feed on roots, whereas   secondary metabolites often deter feeding. In contrast, some secondary   metabolites usually regarded as plant defenses (e.g.,   dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA)), can be exploited by   some root-feeding insects for host location. Insects share several host   location cues with plant parasitic nematodes (CO2, DIMBOA, glutamic   acid), but some compounds (e.g., cucurbitacin A) repel nematodes while   acting as phagostimulants to insects. Moreover, insect and nematode   herbivory can induce exudation of compounds that may be mutually   beneficial, suggesting potentially significant interactions between the   two groups of herbivores.

We   compared symbiotic (S) and non-symbiotic (NS) persistence strategies of   Festuca eskia (Poaceae), an alpine grass infected by the asexual form of   the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae. We characterised endophyte   transmission efficiency, and described vegetative growth and sexual   reproduction in a field population that naturally supports approximately   50\% S plants. We built a demographic model to estimate plant vegetative   growth rates. A correlation between plant persistence strategy, and   fungal maintenance was evaluated by increasing soil resource levels.   Under natural conditions, S and NS plants exploited different   persistence strategies in the same population; S plants exhibited   greater vegetative growth than their NS counterparts, while maintaining   the same reproductive output. In response to higher soil resource   levels, S plants shifted in persistence strategies and phenology,   whereas NS plants maintained the same strategies. Therefore, results   suggested the fungal endophyte fine-tuned host persistence strategies   according to soil resource level. Finally, we found no direct   relationship between the changes induced by fungal endophyte and   endophyte transmission. Consequently, fungal endophytes affected host   persistence strategies, but did not directly increase endophyte   transmission.",111,NO,IF,,,,,

Human commensal species (hereafter   commensals) are a special class of exotic species that live largely off   the resources associated with human activity. The encroachment of   commensals from an urban area into surrounding bushland has been   frequently overlooked as an important component of urban impacts, even   though human-commensals are common to many urban regions globally. In   this review, we present theoretical and empirical evidence for the   processes and outcomes occurring when exotic commensal species encroach   into native bushland. Specifically we ask when, how and why exotic   commensal species encroach into bushland, what determines whether they   establish, and what are the ecological consequences. We focus on the   black rat, Rattus rattus, arguably the archetypal commensal species with   a cosmopolitan distribution and the greatest potential for ecological   damage of all the commensal rodents. We expect that the processes that   we outline apply to other commensal species more broadly. We argue that   commensals are in fact natives of the urban milieu and only become alien   when they encroach into peri-urban bushland. We propose that the   mechanisms of this encroachment will be different from those of other,   non-commensal exotic species because urban areas act as dispersal hubs   to overcome many of the barriers of invasion that other exotic species   face. We suggest that resource supplementation by urban areas creates a   great potential for promoting encroachment, invasion as well as impact.   However, biotic and abiotic barriers to invasion are still relevant for   commensals, highlighting the need to maintain the integrity of   ecosystems and wildlife populations in urban edges so as to prevent   commensal incursion. We examine how commensal black rats affect wildlife   via three fundamental mechanisms, namely, predation, disease transfer   and competition for resources, and also consider their possible positive   impacts acting as functional replacements for lost natives. We conclude   the review with an outline of research priorities and future directions   that are essential for progressing our understanding of the ecology of   commensal species.",112,NO,IF,,,,,

However, altered production   in plant communities is often tightly linked with concomitant shifts in   diversity and composition, and most studies have not disentangled the   direct effects of production on consumers. Furthermore, when studies do   examine the effects of plant production on animals in terrestrial   systems, they are primarily confined to a subset of taxonomic or   functional groups instead of investigating the responses of the entire   community. Using natural monocultures of the salt marsh cordgrass   Spartina alterniflora, we were able to examine the impacts of increased   plant production, independent of changes in plant composition and/or   diversity, on the trophic structure, composition, and diversity of the   entire arthropod community. If arthropod species richness increased with   greater plant production, we predicted that it would be driven by: (1)   an increase in the number of rare species, and/or (2) an increase in   arthropod abundance. Our results largely supported our predictions:   species richness of herbivores, detritivores, predators, and parasitoids   increased monotonically with increasing levels of plant production, and   the diversity of rare species also increased with plant production.   However, rare species that accounted for this difference were predators,   parasitoids, and detritivores, not herbivores. Herbivore species   richness could be simply explained by the relationship between abundance   and diversity. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and   analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), we also found significant changes in   arthropod species composition with increasing levels of production. Our   findings have important implications in the intertidal salt marsh, where   human activities have increased nitrogen runoff into the marsh, and   demonstrate that such nitrogen inputs cascade to affect community   structure, diversity, and abundance in higher trophic levels.",113,NO,IF,,,,,

An animal's elemental composition can be an important indicator of   its physiological state and role in ecosystem nutrient cycling. We   examined the interactive effects of bacterial (Pasteuria ramosa)   infection and phosphorus (P)-poor food on the body stoichiometry of   Daphnia magna. Daphnia were exposed to or held free of a bacterial   parasite and fed algal food of different C:P ratios (100-500) over a   28-day period.   2. To assess the effects of exposure and infection on Daphnia   stoichiometry, we measured their whole body content of carbon (C),   nitrogen (N), and P on four different days (4, 8, 15, and 28) during the   experiment.   3. We found strong effects of infection, food quality, and/or their   interactions on the C, N, and P content of Daphnia, especially as the   infectious disease progressed. At the end of the experiment, infected   animals had significantly more C and less P in their bodies than   uninfected conspecifics. Body N content of Daphnia consuming P-rich food   was reduced by bacterial infection whereas Daphnia consuming P-poor   algae showed increased body N content from infection.   4. Using a mass-balance model, we found that changes in N and P content   of host bodies were largely accountable by disease-induced alterations   to Daphnia reproduction (i.e. bacterial induced sterility) and the   accumulation of Pasteuria spores in the body cavity. Our calculations   also show that the observed increase in host C content could not be   accounted for by loss of eggs or accumulation of bacterial spores. This   instead must result from unidentified changes to underlying daphnid   tissue C content.   5. These results demonstrate that intraspecific variation in zooplankton   body stoichiometry can be caused by exposure to and infection by   bacterial parasites. In addition, these effects were found to depend   both upon the stage of the disease and upon the food quality consumed by   the host.",114,MAYBE,IF,parasite/pathogen affecting stoichiometry of host,yes,,,

As part of the Tropical Amphibian Declines in   Streams (TADS) project, we quantified changes in algal biomass and N   cycling in algae in upland Panamanian streams following the widespread   decline of larval anurans.   Reach-scale monitoring during and after a catastrophic, disease-driven   amphibian decline showed significant 2.8-fold increases (P<0.05) in   algal biomass in pools and 6.3-fold increases in riffles in the 5months   following the decline. 3years after the decline, the magnitude of this   initial change dampened to increases (P<0.05) of 2-fold in pools and   3.5-fold in riffles over pre-decline levels. Similarly, total organic   matter of benthic biofilms, measured as ash-free dry mass (AFDM),   increased significantly by 2.2-fold in pools and 2.3-fold in riffles in   the initial 5-month post-decline period, with the magnitude of these   changes dampening slightly to a 2-fold increase in pools and 1.9-fold   increase in riffles over pre-decline levels after 3years (P<0.05 for   differences at 5months and 3years). There were initial increases   (P<0.05) in Chl a:AFDM ratios 5months after the decline, but ratios had   returned to pre-decline levels after 3years.

Increases in abundance and production of some grazing macroinvertebrate   taxa after the decline may have contributed to the gradual reduction in   the difference between initial and longer-term post-decline algal   biomass.

During spring to summer 2008, 5 groups of 1-yr old oysters   of different origins and ploidy levels deployed in the Thau lagoon   (France) were sampled for biometrical and biochemical analyses;   environmental parameters were monitored in the same area. Mortality   occurred in 2 episodes: 13 May to 10 June and 24 June to 9 July.   Wild-collected oysters showed mortality sooner than other groups but   total overall mortality was 85\% in all groups. Mortality occurred when   seawater temperature was >19 degrees C during the reproductive season   when energetic reserves of oysters were at their lowest. Energy reserve   levels and mortality in oysters seemed to be independent of reproductive   effort, and most likely reflected an unusual deficit in phytoplankton.   The level of bacterial fatty acids in oysters increased markedly before   the second mortality event, probably indicating an enhancement of the   microbial loop or decomposition processes. At the same time,   unsaturation of oyster fatty acids decreased, suggesting a diet change,   acclimatization to increasing temperature or, most likely, oxidative   damage clue to an enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, which   are often associated with stressful situations. Wild-collected and   hatchery-produced oysters, which exhibited different mortality patterns,   showed persistent differences in fatty acid (20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3)   content in their membrane, despite the fact that they were reared in the   same environment. Mortality started when fatty acid 20:4n-6 content   increased to similar to 3\% in the polar lipids, suggesting that this   ratio could make a useful indicator of mortality risk.

We   investigated the introduction and spread of this invasive pathogen, by   analysing its genetic structure and diversity in a large sample from   European vineyards. Populations of P.viticola across Europe displayed   little genetic diversity, consistent with the occurrence of a bottleneck   at the time of introduction. Bayesian coalescent analyses revealed a   clear population expansion signal in the genetic data. We detected a   weak, but significant, continental-wide population structure, with two   geographically and genetically distinct clusters in Western and Eastern   European vineyards. Approximate Bayesian computation, analyses of clines   of genetic diversity and of isolation-by-distance patterns provided   evidence for a wave of colonization moving in an easterly direction   across Europe. This is consistent with historical reports, first   mentioning the introduction of the disease in Bordeaux vineyards   (France) and sub-sequently documenting its rapid spread across Europe.   This initial introduction in the west was probably followed by a   leap-frog' event into Eastern Europe, leading to the formation of the   two genetic clusters we detected.

As a consequence, any functional gene or species   distribution pattern can be compared among metagenomes originating from   various environments and projects. In particular, global comparisons   would help to define ecosystem specificities, such as involvement and   response to climate change (for example, carbon and nitrogen cycle),   human health risks (eg, presence of pathogen species, toxin genes and   viruses) and biodegradation capacities. Although not all scientists have   easy access to high-throughput sequencing technologies, they do have   access to the sequences that have been deposited in databases, and   therefore, can begin to intensively mine these metagenomic data to   generate hypotheses that can be validated experimentally.

In France, it is in fact considered as a risk for   the Mediterranean pond turtle, Mauremys leprosa, and the European pond   turtle, Emys orbicularis, as they may compete for resources and habitat.   Freshwater turtles are also host to a variety of parasites including   protozoans and helminths. When introduced turtles escape, parasites may   spread to native species. The objective of this study was to document   the extent of platyhelminth invasions from T. s. elegans to natural M.   leprosa populations in northern Spain and southern France and to   evaluate the risks that parasite host-switching may pose on indigenous   freshwater turtle species. From DNA barcoding analysis based on the   sequencing of the Cytochrome c Oxidase I gene, the Bayesian tree and   p-distance comparisons of closely related haplotypes revealed a greater   polystome richness within M. leprosa than expected, suggesting that host   switching may take place in natural environments. Because these   parasites most typically infest American turtles like Chrysemys picta   marginata and Graptemys pseudogeographica in their natural home range   and because parasites were also found within T. s. elegans feral   populations, it is suggested that the red-eared slider would serve as a   carrier for a variety of not strictly host-specific polystomes that are   transmitted to M. leprosa throughout the south of France. The global   trade in freshwater turtles thus provides opportunity for parasites to   be transported to new destinations which could impact the physiology,   behavior and survival of native turtle species.",127,NO,IF,,,,,

We explored the factors that potentially affect viral abundance,   viral life strategies (lytic versus lysogenic cycle) and the relative   importance of viral lysis and heterotrophic nanoflagellate grazing for   prokaryote mortality in the euphotic zone of 19 freshwater lakes in a   single geographical region (the French Massif Central).   2. Flow cytometry indicated that viral abundance ranged from 0.5 to   26.3x10(7) viruses mL(-1), exceeding prokaryote abundance by c. 16-fold   on average. Multiple regressions revealed that prokaryotic abundance was   the best predictor of viral abundance (r(2)=0.74), suggesting that the   prokaryotes were the major hosts for viral proliferation in these lakes.   3. Viral life strategies varied with month of sampling (June, July,   August 2010). Lytic infection was the prominent mode of viral infection   in June and August, whereas lysogenic infection was more evident in July   in the majority of sampled lakes. This temporal shift in viral strategy   was controlled by the availability of phosphate and chlorophyll   concentration via host cell growth, with high concentrations favouring   lytic infection and low concentrations favouring lysogenic infection.   Such antagonistic interactions between viral life strategies support the   hypothesis that lysogeny may represent a survival strategy for viruses   in harsh nutrient/host conditions.   4. The dominance of viruses over flagellates, or vice versa, as   prokaryotic mortality factors differed between the lakes. By taking into   account both forms of mortality, our study indicates that viruses and   flagellates are likely to act additively in their effects on prokaryotes   by regulating the proportion of the most active members of the   prokaryotic community. Such a combined effect of viruses and flagellates   may strongly influence the planktonic food web and whole-ecosystem   functioning.",128,NO,IF,viral concentration,,,,

Understanding   these processes is a critical step in accurately understanding the   biochemical responses to natural salmon deposition and appropriately   mitigating for its loss. Additionally, the movement of carcasses for   nutrient enhancement poses the risk of spreading pathogens and disease.   Freezing and pasteurization of the carcasses reduces this risk. However,   the effect of these treatments on decomposition processes is unknown.   Decomposition rate and nutrient dynamics were investigated in semi-arid   central Idaho by decomposing salmon carcasses in soil-filled microcosms.   Rapid thermal accumulation in this semi-arid climate resulted in   completion of soft tissue decomposition (skeletonization) in 16 days.   Soil dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved total N (DTN) increased   dramatically with respective increases from pretreatment concentrations   of 7 and 48 fold by the time skeletonization occurred. Isotopic analysis   of fluids beneath the carcasses revealed up to a 6 parts per thousand   change in fluid delta C-13 and delta N-15 during decomposition as well   as an overall 4 parts per thousand enrichment in mean fluid delta N-15,   relative to whole reference carcasses. Freezing and pasteurization of   carcasses only yielded differences during the first few days of   decomposition relative to the fresh carcasses.

However, actual variations in population   size can often be driven by other demographic parameters, such as   juvenile survival, when they show high temporal variability. We used   capture-recapture data from a long-term study of a hunted, migratory   species, the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), to assess   temporal variability in first-year survival and the relative importance   of natural and hunting mortality. We also conducted a parasite-removal   experiment to determine the effect of internal parasites and body   condition on temporal variation in juvenile survival. We found that   juvenile survival showed a higher temporal variability than adult   survival and that natural mortality was more important than hunting   mortality, unlike in adults. Parasite removal increased first-year   survival and reduced its annual variability in females only. Body   condition at fledging was also positively correlated with first-year   survival in treated females. With reduced parasite load, females, which   are thought to invest more in their immune system than males according   to Bateman's principle, could probably reallocate more energy to growth   than males, leading to a higher survival. Treated birds also had a   higher survival than control ones during their second year, suggesting a   developmental effect that manifested later in life.

Determining the status (native or non-native) of emerging   pathogens, and tracing back their spatio-temporal dynamics, is crucial   to understand the eco-evolutionary factors promoting their emergence, to   control their spread and mitigate their impacts. However, tracing back   the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging wildlife pathogens is   challenging because (i) they are often neglected until they become   sufficiently abundant and pose socio-economical concerns and (ii) their   geographical range is often little known. Here, we combined classical   population genetics tools and approximate Bayesian computation (i.e.   ABC) to retrace the dynamics of Tracheliastes polycolpus, a poorly   documented pathogenic ectoparasite emerging in Western Europe that   threatens several freshwater fish species. Our results strongly suggest   that populations of T. polycolpus in France emerged from individuals   originating from a unique genetic pool that were most likely introduced   in the 1920s in central France. From this initial population, three   waves of colonization occurred into peripheral watersheds within the   next two decades. We further demonstrated that populations remained at   low densities, and hence undetectable, during 10 years before a major   demographic expansion occurred, and before its official detection in   France. These findings corroborate and expand the few historical records   available for this emerging pathogen. More generally, our study   demonstrates how ABC can be used to determine the status, reconstruct   the colonization history and infer key evolutionary parameters of   emerging wildlife pathogens with low data availability, and for which   samples from the putative native area are inaccessible.",131,NO,IF,,,,,

We employ an integrated natural and social science   approach to assess potential mechanisms leading to the collapse of an   estuarine social-ecological system, and recommend future paths to   increased system resilience. Our case study is the collapse of the   eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery in Apalachicola Bay,   Florida, USA, and the associated impacts on local resource dependent   communities. The oyster fishery collapse is the most recent in a series   of environmental stressors to this region, which have included   hurricanes and tropical storms, drought, and the Deepwater Horizon oil   spill. We found it likely that the oyster collapse was not related to   contamination from the recent oil spill, but rather to factors affecting   oyster recruitment and survival, which may have been mediated by both   human, e.g., fishing-related habitat alteration, and environmental,   e.g., increased natural mortality from predators and disease, factors.   The relative impact of each of these factors is likely to increase in   the future because of changing climate and increased demand for fishery,   water, and petroleum resources. Successful restoration and persistence   of a viable oyster fishery will depend on: (1) implementation of some   minimal best management practices, e.g., extensive habitat restoration   via shell addition, and some spatial closures to harvest, (2) improving   environmental knowledge and promoting episodic learning through enhanced   monitoring and experimental management, and (3) continued community   engagement necessary to produce adaptable governance suitable to   responding to future unexpected challenges.",132,NO,IF,,,,,

The functional, the   numerical, and the resulting total response (i.e., how the predator per   capita intake, the population of predators and the total of prey eaten   by the total predators vary with prey densities) are fundamental as they   reveal the predator's ability to regulate prey population dynamics.   Here, we used a multi-spatio-temporal scale approach to simultaneously   explore the functional and numerical responses of a territorial predator   (Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus) to its two main prey species (the   rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and the red-legged partridge Alectoris   rufa) during the breeding period in a Mediterranean system of south   Spain. Bonelli's eagle responded functionally, but not numerically, to   rabbit/partridge density changes. Type II, non-regulatory, functional   responses (typical of specialist predators) offered the best fitting   models for both prey. In the absence of a numerical response, Bonelli's   eagle role as a regulating factor of rabbit and partridge populations   seems to be weak in our study area.

Meta-analysis suggested that   the various experimental methods tend to result in different feedback   values. Yet, a direct comparison of the different experimental   approaches and their statistical analyses is lacking.   2. We used currently applied methods to calculate plant-soil feedback   value ranges and compared their statistical analyses to those based on   actual biomass data. Then, we re-analysed a case study to compare   plant-soil feedback values obtained under the same environmental   conditions, but using different experimental approaches: soil   sterilization, addition of soil inoculum, and soil conditioning by `own'   vs. `foreign' plant species.   3. Different measures to calculate plant-soil feedback values were more   variable in positive than in negative feedback values. Analysis of   calculated feedback values that are based on treatment averages can lead   to a serious inflation of type I errors.   4.

Soil sterilization and addition of soil   organisms yielded larger feedback than comparison of own and foreign   soil.   5. Synthesis. The ecological interpretation of plant-soil feedback   effects strongly depends on the experimental procedure. When the   research question focuses on the strength and the sign of plant-soil   feedback, soil sterilization (presumed that the side effect of increased   nutrient availability can be controlled) or addition of soil inoculum is   to be preferred. When the research question concerns the specificity of   soil feedback effects, plant performance can be better compared between   own and foreign soil.

Surface water from 12 waterways,   including 11 rivers/steams and 1 lake, were examined for the presence of   ABR phenotypes, using a direct antibiotic susceptibility assay and   demonstrated the presence of ABR (in increasing order of resistance), to   the following 19 agents: amikacin (17\%), gentamicin (17\%),   ciprofloxacin (33\%), colistin (42\%), linezolid (42\%), tobramycin   (42\%), vancomycin (42\%), ertapenem (67\%), erythromycin (75\%),   meropenem (75\%), rifampin (75\%), teichoplanin (75\%), tetracycline   (75\%), trimethoprim (75\%), fusidic acid (83\%), aztreonam (92\%),   clindamycin (92\%), penicillin (92\%) and cefoxitin (100\%).

Overall, these data indicate that   waterborne bacteria are an important source of ABR determinants and   contribute to the mass balance of ABR in the environment, and may be   used as an indicator of ecological change in water ecosystems. The   waterborne ABR organisms may potentially act as donors in pathogens,   which may acquire these through horizontal gene transfer or other   genetic exchange events, thus leading to clinically significant cases in   both animal and human health. Therefore, environmental bacteria should   not be regarded as being devoid of ABR determinants, simply because they   are physically removed from clinical settings. Such bacteria have   natural intrinsic resistance, as well as having the ability to acquire   determinants from agricultural run-off and human wastewater discharge,   which may contain ABR organisms, as well as sublethal concentrations of   metabolically active antibiotic.

They have been shown to alter litterfall properties and   decomposition rates in environments where they occur. Despite this   recognition, the role of mistletoes in nutrient cycling in semi-arid   savanna remains poorly understood. We investigated the litter input,   element returns, and associated below-canopy soil nutrient   concentrations of three mistletoe species (Erianthemum ngamicum,   Plicosepalus kalachariensis, and Viscum verrucosum) that parasitize   Acacia karroo trees in a semi-arid savanna, southwest Zimbabwe. Element   concentrations in mistletoe leaf litter were enriched relative to the   host. Litterfall from mistletoes significantly increased overall   litterfall by up to 173 \%, with E. ngamicum and P. kalachariensis   having greater litterfall than their host trees. Associated with these   changes in litterfall was an increase in element returns and the   below-canopy soil nutrient concentrations. The increase in nutrient   returns was due to both the effect of enriched mistletoe litter and   increased volumes of litterfall beneath host trees. Litterfall, element   returns, and the below-canopy soil nutrient concentrations were   significantly influenced by mistletoe density, with higher values at   high mistletoe density. Overall, E. ngamicum and P. kalachariensis had   greater influence on litterfall, element returns, and soil nutrient   concentrations than V. verrucosum. These findings are consistent with   current understanding of enhanced nutrient cycling in the presence of   parasitic plants particularly in nutrient-poor ecosystems.

Using field data from   179 orchards spatially divided in five citrus-producing agroecosystems,   we examined the mechanisms that could explain displacement or   coexistence between both Aphytis species in relation to weather   conditions. The distribution and abundance of the parasitoid species are   related to the mean summer and winter temperatures and relative humidity   of each ecosystem. The relative proportion of A. melinus is higher   during the warm months, and the abundance of A. chrysomphali increases   from south to north, being higher in the cooler northern areas. Aphytis   melinus has displaced A. chrysomphali from hot and dry areas, whereas   regions with mild summer temperatures and moderate relative humidity   present the optimal conditions for the coexistence of the two   parasitoids. The more negative effects of winter temperatures on A.   melinus allow the earlier use of the available host resource in late   winter and spring by A. chrysomphali and the coexistence of both   parasitoids in the same orchard via temporal niche partitioning. We   combine previous literature on the behavior of Aphytis species in the   laboratory under different temperature and humidity conditions with our   field results to confirm the role of spatiotemporal weather conditions   and seasonal changes in host stages on the variation of Aphytis relative   abundance and parasitoid coexistence.",137,NO,IF,,,,,

Seed production in these forests   represents only the first of several pulsed events. Secondary pulses   emerge as mast-consuming small rodents numerically respond to seed   production and tertiary pulses emerge as generalist predators   numerically respond to rodents. Raptors may also respond behaviorally   (i. e., diet shifts) to subsequent crashes in small rodents following   the crash phase in seed production. In oak-dominated forest in the   Hudson Valley, New York, these various pulse and crash phases act   synergistically, although not simultaneously, to influence thrush   population dynamics through predation on nests, juveniles, and adults.   As a consequence, factors limiting population growth rate and their   age-specific action vary as a function of past acorn production. We   highlight these interactions based on our eight-year study of thrush   demography, acorn production, and small mammal abundance coupled with   information on regional adult thrush population trends from the Breeding   Bird Survey. We use these data sets to demonstrate the sequence of   primary to tertiary pulses and how they influence breeding thrush   populations. To extend our discussion beyond masting phenomena in the   eastern United States, we briefly review the literature of alternative   avian prey within pulsed systems to show ( 1) numerical and behavioral   responses by generalist predators are ubiquitous in pulsed systems, and   this contributes to ( 2) variability in reproduction and survivorship of   avian prey linked to the underlying dynamics of the pulse.

We used CDV in the Greater   Yellowstone ecosystem's (GYE) wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (Canis   latrans) as a case study for exploring how metapopulation structure,   host demographics, and multi-host transmission affect the critical   community size and spatial scale required for CDV persistence. We   illustrate how host spatial connectivity and demographic turnover   interact to affect both local epidemic dynamics, such as the length and   variation in inter-epidemic periods, and pathogen persistence using   stochastic, spatially explicit susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered   simulation models. Given the apparent absence of other known persistence   mechanisms (e. g., a carrier or environmental state, densely populated   host, chronic infection, or a vector), we suggest that CDV requires   either large spatial scales or multi-host transmission for persistence.   Current GYE wolf populations are probably too small to support endemic   CDV. Coyotes are a plausible reservoir host, but CDV would still require   50 000-100 000 individuals for moderate persistence (>50\% over 10   years), which would equate to an area of 1-3 times the size of the GYE   (60 000-200 000 km(2)). Coyotes, and carnivores in general, are not   uniformly distributed; therefore, this is probably a gross underestimate   of the spatial scale of CDV persistence. However, the presence of a   second competent host species can greatly increase the probability of   long-term CDV persistence at much smaller spatial scales. Although no   management of CDV is currently recommended for the GYE, wolf managers in   the region should expect periodic but unpredictable CDV-related   population declines as often as every 2-5 years. Awareness and   monitoring of such outbreaks will allow corresponding adjustments in   management activities such as regulated public harvest, creating a   smooth transition to state wolf management and conservation after >30   years of being protected by the Endangered Species Act.",140,NO,IF,,,,,

However, when considering pests and pathogens,   eradication, not persistence, is often the end goal. Humans may   intervene to control nuisance populations, resulting in reciprocal   interactions between the human and natural systems that can lead to   unexpected dynamics. The incidence of these human-natural couplings has   been increasing, hastening the need to better understand the emergent   properties of such systems in order to predict and manage outbreaks of   pests and pathogens. For example, the success of the growing aquaculture   industry depends on our ability to manage pathogens and maintain a   healthy environment for farmed and wild fish. We developed a model for   the dynamics of connected populations subject to control, motivated by   sea louse parasites that can disperse among salmon farms. The model   includes exponential population growth with a forced decline when   populations reach a threshold, representing control interventions.   Coupling two populations with equal growth rates resulted in phase   locking or synchrony in their dynamics. Populations with different   growth rates had different periods of oscillation, leading to   quasiperiodic dynamics when coupled. Adding small amounts of   stochasticity destabilized quasiperiodic cycles to chaos, while   stochasticity was damped for periodic or stable dynamics. Our analysis   suggests that strict treatment thresholds, although well intended, can   complicate parasite dynamics and hinder control efforts. Synchronizing   populations via coordinated management among farms leads to more   effective control that is required less frequently. Our model is simple   and generally applicable to other systems where dispersal affects the   management of pests and pathogens.",141,NO,IF,,,,,

Animals that seek overwintering sites   underground, for example, may be constrained by the energy required to   burrow into the soil. We conducted field and laboratory studies to   determine the relationship between individual size and overwintering   site selection in the tephritid flies, Rhagoletis juglandis and   Rhagoletis suavis. We also explored the effect of site selection on   pupal mortality, parasitism, and the ability to emerge from   overwintering sites after eclosion. In both species, and in both lab and   field tests, larger pupae were found at deeper soil depths. In addition,   marginally non-significant trends indicated pupae in deeper sites were   48 \% more likely to survive the overwintering period. Finally, larger   individuals were more likely to eclose and emerge from the soil at a   given depth, but flies in deep overwintering sites were less likely to   emerge from those sites than flies in shallow sites. Our data indicate   that overwintering site selection represents a trade-off between   avoiding predators and parasites that occur at shallow sites, and the   energetic and mortality costs of burrowing to, overwintering in, and   emerging from, deeper sites. The size-dependent overwintering site   selection demonstrated here has implications for population dynamics and   pest control strategies. Some fly control measures, such as the   introduction of parasites or predators, will be mitigated when the   deepest and least accessible overwintering pupae represent a   disproportionately large amount of the population's reproductive   capacity.",143,NO,IF,,,,,

It   requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this   will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as   such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the   existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current   conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this   task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for   the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from   here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by   recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or   properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By   shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this   new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic   understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal   scales.   Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of ecological   communities, we have little insights on how (and why) they vary through   space and time. In this article, we build on existing empirical   literature to show that the same species may happen to interact in   different ways when their local abundances vary, their trait   distribution changes, or when the environment affects either of these   factors. We discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing   frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species interactions.",144,NO,IF,,,,,

Different metabolic rates were induced by conducting   experiments at three temperatures (17, 23, and 28 degrees C), testing   recently fed crabs, and those infected with the parasitic dinoflagellate   Hematodinium perezi. The effects of hypoxia on the metabolic rates and   recovery times of individuals following enforced exhaustive activity,   and metabolic rates following feeding, were also measured to determine   the levels of hypoxia likely to impact feeding, digestion, and overall   energetics. Contrary to previously published results, blue crab were   found not to be partial oxygen conformers (i.e., where metabolic rate   falls in concert with reductions in ambient oxygen), but rather to be   oxygen regulators (i.e., to have the ability to maintain a constant   aerobic metabolic rate until the critical oxygen level was reached). By   this measure, at routine metabolic rates blue crab are as   hypoxia-tolerant as other decapod crustaceans with a median critical   oxygen level of -20\% air saturation (at 17 and 23 degrees C). Critical   oxygen levels increased in concert with the increases in metabolic rate   occurring at 28 degrees C, in individuals infected with H. perezii, and   those recently fed. At the highest metabolic rates (measured in recently   fed individuals at 28 degrees C) median critical oxygen level was -45\%   air saturation. Consistent with this latter observation, metabolic rates   after feeding or exercise were not compromised until below 50\% air   saturation, although maximum metabolic rates were lower at this level of   hypoxia.

In this study we   analyzed changes in forest types, forest disturbances, and forest   recovery for the Carpathian ecoregion in Eastern Europe. We generated a   series of image composites at five year intervals between 1985 and 2010   and utilized a hybrid analysis strategy consisting of radiometric change   classification, post-classification comparison and continuous index- and   segment-based post-disturbance recovery assessment. For validation of   the disturbance map we used a point-based accuracy assessment, and   assessed the accuracy of our forest type maps using forest inventory   data and statistically sampled ground truth data for 2010. Our   Carpathian-wide disturbance map achieved an overall accuracy of 86\% and   the forest type maps up to 73\% accuracy. While our results suggested a   small net forest increase in the Carpathians, almost 20\% of the forests   experienced stand-replacing disturbances over the past 25 years. Forest   recovery seemed to only partly counterbalance the widespread natural   disturbances and clear-cutting activities. Disturbances were most   widespread during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but some areas also   exhibited extensive forest disturbances after 2000, especially in the   Polish, Czech and Romanian Carpathians. Considerable shifts in forest   composition occurred in the Carpathians, with disturbances increasingly   affecting coniferous forests, and a relative decrease in coniferous and   mixed forests. Both aspects are likely connected to an increased   vulnerability of spruce plantations to pests and pathogens in the   Carpathians. Overall, our results exemplify the highly dynamic nature of   forest cover during times of socio-economic and institutional change,   and highlight the value of the Landsat archive for monitoring these   dynamics.

Woodfuel management is   mainly carried out by silvicultural thinning or short-rotation   harvesting, including coppicing. Potential negative effects include   reduction in habitat quality for saproxylic species. However, in some   regions, habitats may be improved for species that have declined as a   result of increased shading. Resources required by most of these species   are more likely to be delivered by short-rotation management than   thinning. Relatively little is documented on the effects of thinning   intensity on ecological resources and biodiversity within European   forests. Trade-offs between canopy cover, deer browsing pressure and   understorey complexity are likely to occur. Therefore, interactions   between thinning treatments and deer browsing potentially affect   biodiversity, in the context of both woodfuel and timber   production.Synthesis and applications. Woodfuel management is unlikely   to deliver benefits for most shade-intolerant species unless it creates   substantial areas of young-growth with low deer impacts. However, more   research is needed on thinning as a potential conservation tool.   Changing climate and tree diseases are creating an uncertain future for   forest management.

Widespread dieback of cushion plants and bryophytes in alpine   fellfield on Macquarie Island may represent such change. Loss of the   keystone endemic cushion plant, Azorella macquariensis, was so severe   that it has been declared critically endangered. We document the dieback   and its extent. Due to the rapidity of the event, we sought to infer   causes by testing two mechanistic hypotheses: (i) that extensive dieback   was due to a pathogen and (ii) that dieback was a consequence of a   change in climate that induced stress in several susceptible species. We   searched for pathogens using both conventional and next-generation   sequencing techniques. We examined plant functional morphology in   conjunction with a long-term climate record of plant-relevant climate   parameters to determine whether environmental conditions had become   inimical for A.macquariensis. Dieback was found across the entire range   of A.macquariensis. A survey found 88\% of 115 stratified/ random sites   contained affected cushions and 84\% contained dead bryophytes.   Within-site dieback increased over time. No conclusive evidence that   A.macquariensis deaths were caused by a definitive disease-causing   pathogen emerged. However, the presence of bacterial, fungal and   oomycete taxa, some potentially pathogenic, suggested that stressed   cushions could become susceptible to infection. The primary cause of   collapse is suspected failure of A.macquariensis and other fellfield   species to withstand recent decadal changes in summer water   availability. Increased wind speed, sunshine hours and   evapotranspiration resulted in accumulated deficits of plant available   water spanning 17years (1992-2008). High vulnerability to interrupted   water supply was consistent with functional morphology of   A.macquariensis, and climate change has altered the species' environment   from wet and misty to one subject to periods of drying.Synthesis and   applications. With alpine fellfield dieback baseline data on Macquarie   Island established, future monitoring will determine whether this event   represents a transient, decadal-level change in the ecosystem or the   initiation of a climate-related, transformation away from an   Azorella-dominated fellfield ecosystem.

Here, we   investigate how elevated temperatures impact a critical phase of the   life cycle of the bird tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus the growth of   plerocercoid larvae in host fish (three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus   aculeatus). By 8 weeks post-infection, plerocercoids recovered from   experimentally infected sticklebacks held at 20 degrees C weighed on   average 104.9 mg, with all exceeding 50 mg, the mass considered   consistently infective to definitive hosts. In contrast, plerocercoids   from sticklebacks held at 15 degrees C weighed on average 26.5 mg, with   none exceeding 50 mg. As small increases in plerocercoid mass affect   adult fecundity disproportionately in this species, enhanced   plerocercoid growth at higher temperatures predicts dramatically   increased output of infective parasite stages. Subsequent screening of   thermal preferences of sticklebacks from a population with endemic S.   solidus infection demonstrated that fish harbouring infective   plerocercoids show significant preferences for warmer temperatures. Our   results therefore indicate that parasite transmission might be affected   in at least two ways under anthropogenic warming; by enhancing rates of   parasite growth and development, and by increasing the likelihood of   hosts being able to seek out proliferating warmer microhabitats.   Furthermore, our results suggest the potential for positive feedback   between parasite growth and host thermal preferences, which could   dramatically increase the effects of even small temperature increases.

The health and survival of   marine invertebrates is often dependent on intimate symbiotic   associations with complex microbial communities, yet we have a very   limited understanding of the detailed biology and ecology of both the   host and the symbiont community in response to environmental stressors,   such as elevated seawater temperatures. Here, we use the ecologically   important sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile as a model to explore the   changes in symbiosis during the development of temperature-induced   necrosis. Expression profiling of the sponge host was examined in   conjunction with the phylogenetic and functional structure and the   expression profile of the symbiont community. Elevated temperature   causes an immediate stress response in both the host and symbiont   community, including reduced expression of functions that mediate their   partnership. Disruption to nutritional interdependence and molecular   interactions during early heat stress further destabilizes the   holobiont, ultimately leading to the loss of archetypal sponge symbionts   and the introduction of new microorganisms that have functional and   expression profiles consistent with a scavenging lifestyle, a lack   virulence functions and a high growth rate. Previous models have   postulated various mechanisms of mortality and disease in marine   invertebrates.

Insects   were sampled using a combination of sticky traps and vacuum sampling,   identified to morphospecies and the insect community with respect to   abundance, richness, and evenness quantified. Individuals were assigned   to four broad feeding guilds in order to examine potential trophic level   effects. Although there were occasional effects of CO(2) and water   treatment, the effects of warming on the insect community were large and   consistent. Warming significantly increased Order Thysanoptera abundance   and reduced overall morphospecies richness and evenness. Nonmetric   multidimensional scaling found that only temperature affected insect   community composition, while a Sorensen similarity index showed less   correspondence in the insect community between temperature treatments   compared with CO(2) or soil water treatments. Within the herbivore   guild, elevated temperature significantly reduced richness and evenness.   Corresponding reductions of diversity measures at higher trophic levels   (i.e. parasitoids), along with the finding that herbivore richness was a   significant predictor of parasitoid richness, suggest trophic-level   effects within the insect community. When the most abundant species were   considered in temperature treatments, a small number of species   increased in abundance at elevated temperature, while others declined   compared with ambient temperature. Effects of temperature in the   dominant insects demonstrated that treatment effects were limited to a   relatively small number of morphospecies. Observed effects of elevated   CO(2) concentration on whole-community foliar N concentration did not   result in any effect on herbivores, which are probably the most   susceptible guild to changes in plant nutritional quality.

Theory predicts that asexual lineages can be   driven to extinction by uncontrolled proliferation of vertically   transmitted transposable elements (TEs), which accumulate because of the   inefficiency of purifying selection in the absence of sex and   recombination. To test this prediction, we compared genome-wide TE load   between a sexual lineage of the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina clavipes and   a lineage of the same species that is rendered asexual by   Wolbachia-induced parthenogenesis. We obtained draft genome sequences at   1520x coverage of both the sexual and the asexual lineages using   next-generation sequencing. We identified transposons of most major   classes in both lineages. Quantification of TE abundance using coverage   depth showed that copy numbers in the asexual lineage exceeded those in   the sexual lineage for DNA transposons, but not LTR and LINE-like   elements. However, one or a small number of gypsy-like LTR elements   exhibited a fourfold higher coverage in the asexual lineage.   Quantitative PCR showed that high loads of this gypsy-like TE were   characteristic for 11 genetically distinct asexual wasp lineages when   compared to sexual lineages. We found no evidence for an overall   increase in copy number for all TE types in asexuals as predicted by   theory. Instead, we suggest that the expansions of specific TEs are best   explained as side effects of (epi)genetic manipulations of the host   genome by Wolbachia.

Introduction of commercial   crops was a common adaptation action, reflecting farmers' response to   warming temperatures and changing economic opportunities, but greater   sensitivity of the introduced crops may cause maladaptation. Despite   intensification of cropping systems, households continue to maintain a   median four potato varieties with different tolerance traits, yet this   risk management practice was not perceived as adaptation.

Based on ITS sequence   variations, 463 fungal endophytes were distinguished as 112 operational   taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the Sordariomycetes (77 OTUs, 373   isolates), Dothideomycetes (18 OTUs, 38 isolates), and Agaricomycetes   (17 OTUs, 52 strains) classes. Colletotrichum (28.51 \%), Nemania (14.90   \%), Phomopsis (13.17 \%), and Xylaria (4.97 \%) were the most abundant   genera. Both endophyte diversity and overall isolation frequency   increased with time since introduction. The genetic differentiation of   the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides indicated that the dispersal   of endophytes was likely affected by a combination of geographic factors   and the invasion history of the host A. adenophora.",158,NO,IF,,,,,

Models of host-parasite coevolution are based on   the assumption that genetic variation for host-parasite interactions is   a significant cause of variation in infection, and that variation in   environmental conditions does not overwhelm the genetic basis. However,   surprisingly little is known about the stability of genotype-genotype   interactions under variable environmental conditions. Here, using a   naturally occurring plant-pathogen interaction, I tested whether the two   distinct aspects of the infection process - infectivity and transmission   potential - vary over realistic nutrient and temperature gradients. I   show that the initial pathogen infectivity and host resistance responses   are robust over the environmental gradients. However, for compatible   responses there were striking differences in how different pathogen   life-history stages and host and pathogen genotypes responded to   environmental variation. For some pathogen genotypes even slight changes   in temperature arrested spore production, rendering the developing   infection ineffectual. The response of pathogen genotypes to   environmental gradients varied in magnitude and even direction, so that   their rankings changed across the abiotic gradients. Hence, the variable   environment of spatially structured host-parasite interactions may   strongly influence the maintenance of polymorphism in pathogen   life-history stages governing transmission, whereas evolutionary   trajectories of infectivity may be unaffected by the surrounding   environment.",159,NO,IF,,,,,

A perspective from developed landscapes is essential for   understanding remnant natural ecosystems, because most species   experience their surroundings at spatial scales beyond the plot level,   and spillover between natural and managed ecosystems is common.   Agricultural bird species have greater habitat and diet breadth than   forest species. Based on a global data base, bird assemblages in   tropical agroforest ecosystems were composed of disproportionately more   frugivorous and nectarivorous, but fewer insectivorous bird species   compared with forest. Similarly, insect predators of plant-feeding   arthropods were more diverse in Ecuadorian agroforest and forest   compared with rice and pasture, while, in Indonesia, bee diversity was   also higher in forested habitats. Hence, diversity of insectivorous   birds and insect predators as well as bee pollinators declined with   agricultural transformation. In contrast, with increasing agricultural   intensification, avian pollinators and seed dispersers initially   increase then decrease in proportion. It is well established that the   proximity of agricultural habitats to forests has a strong influence on   the functional diversity of agroecosystems. Community similarity is   higher among agricultural systems than in natural habitats and higher in   simple than in complex landscapes for both birds and insects, so natural   communities, low-intensity agriculture, and heterogeneous landscapes   appear to be critical in the preservation of beta diversity. We require   a better understanding of the relative role of landscape composition and   the spatial configuration of landscape elements in affecting spillover   of functionally important species across managed and natural habitats.   This is important for data-based management of tropical human-dominated   landscapes sustaining the capacity of communities to reorganize after   disturbance and to ensure ecological functioning.",160,NO,IF,,,,,

We focus on legionellosis and nontuberculous   mycobacterial diseases from the viewpoint of their environmental   linkage. While Legionella spp. are ubiquitous in aquatic environments,   Legionella pneumophila often increases in anthropogenic environments,   such as cooling towers or spas, and can cause outbreaks of   legionellosis. Recently, travel-associated Legionnaires' disease has   caused concern in many countries. The numbers of patients infected with   nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) have increased worldwide since the   1990s.

Leaf   domatia primarily occur in the axials of secondary veins and are often   inhabited by microbivorous and predaceous mites which often increase   plant growth rates and reproductive success by controlling plant pests.   Our study investigated if domatia investment is limited by plant primary   productivity. To our knowledge no studies have tested if foliar domatia   are resource-limited. We tested our hypothesis using the genus Coprosma   (Rubiaceae), conducting correlative field surveys and manipulative   experiments measuring domatia production in new leaves along   temperature, nutrient and irradiance gradients. Field surveys indicated   a strong positive association between leaf area, the number of secondary   veins, and domatia per leaf. The number of potential sites for domatia   is underutilised, with leaves on selected Coprosma species having on   average 47 to 72\% of the `maximum' number of available sites where   domatia could occur. Foliar carbon was positively associated with   domatia investment. Coprosma plants held under elevated night-time   temperatures showed a 34-91\% decrease in daily carbon gain, a 38\%   decrease in domatia per leaf mass, and a positive relationship between   domatia investment and integrated daily carbon gain. Under irradiance   and nutrient stress, our data indicated evidence of a positive   relationship between domatia investment and foliar carbon. We found a   significant negative association between relative investment in domatia   produced and investment in new leaf biomass. Our findings suggest   investment in foliar domatia is limited by primary productivity. We   propose that domatia are discretionary goods and not intrinsic   structures produced automatically on leaves that mites utilize.

Dung beetles were   classified in three functional groups, depending on their size and dung   manipulation method: dwellers, large and small tunnelers. Other soil   inhabiting fauna were included as a fourth functional group. Dung   removal and seed dispersal by each individual functional group and   combinations thereof were estimated in exclusion experiments using   different dung types.

The ecosystem   services in dung removal and secondary seed dispersal provided by dung   beetles were significant and differed between functional groups.   Although in absolute numbers more dwellers were found, large tunnelers   were disproportionally important for dung burial and seed removal.

Understanding patterns of   hemoparasite infections in natural populations can therefore inform   about emerging disease risks, especially in the light of climate change   and human disruption of natural ecosystems. We investigated the effects   of host age, sex, host group size and season on infection patterns of   Plasmodium sp., Babesia sp. and filarial nematodes in a population of   wild Malagasy primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), as   well as the effects of these infections on hematological variables. We   tested 45 blood samples from 36 individuals and identified two species   of Plasmodium, one species of Babesia and two species of filarial   nematodes. Plasmodium spp. and Babesia sp. infections showed opposite   patterns of age-dependency, with babesiosis being prevalent among young   animals, while older animals were infected with Plasmodium sp. In   addition, Babesia sp. infection was a statistically significant negative   predictor of Plasmodium sp. infection. These results suggest that   Plasmodium and Babesia parasites may interact within the host, either   through cross-immunity or via resource competition, so that Plasmodium   infections can only establish after babesiosis has resolved. We found no   effects of host sex, host group size and season on hemoparasite   infections. Infections showed high prevalences and did not influence   hematological variables. This preliminary evidence supports the   impression that the hosts and parasites considered in this study appear   to be well-adapted to each other, resulting in persistent infections   with low pathogenic and probably low zoonotic potential.

However, it is   not well understood how the tempo and mode of niche evolution can   influence ecosystem function. In evolutionary models where either   species differences accumulate through random drift in a single trait or   species differences accumulate through divergent selection among close   relatives, we should expect that ecosystem function is strongly related   to diversity. However, when strong selection causes species to converge   on specific niches or when novel traits that directly affect function   evolve in some clades but not others, the relationship between diversity   and ecosystem function might not be very strong. We test these ideas   using a field experiment that established plant mixtures with differing   phylogenetic diversities and we measured ten different community   functions. We show that some functions were strongly predicted by   species richness and mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (MPD, a measure   of phylogenetic diversity), including biomass production and the   reduction of herbivore and pathogen damage in polyculture, while other   functions had weaker (litter production and structural complexity) or   nonsignificant relationships (e.g., flower production and arthropod   abundance) with MPD and richness.

The objective of the Ontario elk   restoration program, a multipartnered collaboration, was to restore a   species that had been extirpated from the province during the 1800s.   During 1998-2001, 460 elk were acquired from Elk Island National Park,   Alberta, for release in four areas of Ontario. As greater than 90\% of   the elk were radio collared, monitoring provided detailed information on   the dynamics of the four populations. Comprehensive research projects   using graduate students were implemented to determine the environmental   impact of releasing elk in Ontario. Those studies are in progress or   have been completed and include the effect of wolf predation on restored   elk, white-tailed deer and elk resource overlap, the development of   genetic profiles for elk, and solutions for elk/human conflicts.   Mortality of the released elk averaged 41\% (190/460) during 1998-2004   with annual mortality generally declining over time in each release   area. The primary causes of elk mortality included wolf predation (25\%   of mortalities), illegal shooting (13\%), stress-related emaciation   (13\%) (partially due to the stress of relocation), bacterial infections   (7\%), and collisions with vehicles (6\%). Productivity has been high in   one of the release areas with 24-65\% of the cows being observed with   calves during late winter surveys. However, productivity has been low in   two of the northern release areas due to a variety of factors including   wolf predation. In some areas, dispersion of elk appeared to be related   to the length of time animals were kept in pens prior to release. The   precalving population estimate for Ontario in March 2004 was 375-440   elk.

These   impacts may in part be determined by feedbacks between plants and   associated microbes, including both endophytic fungal symbionts and   viral pathogens.   To test potential key components of these feedbacks in a grassland   system, we conducted a field experiment that factorially manipulated   temperature regime, precipitation regime and endophyte infection of a   dominant species, Schedonorus arundinaceus. After one growing season, we   evaluated the four most frequently occurring grass species for infection   by three species of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs).   For S.arundinaceus, we also tracked changes in viral prevalence over an   additional two growing seasons, for a total of three growing seasons.   Plant species identity played a strong role in determining virus   prevalence; Poa pratensis and Paspalum dilatatum were more frequently   infected than either S.arundinaceus (endophyte infected or endophyte   free) or Eleusine indica. Both elevated temperature and elevated   precipitation impacted virus prevalence, but effects varied among years   and interacted with fungal endophyte symbiosis for S.arundinaceus.   In the final year of data collection, elevated precipitation increased   virus prevalence in endophyte-infected, but not endophyte-free,   S.arundinaceus. In the same year, but regardless of endophyte infection,   elevated temperature by itself increased virus prevalence for   S.arundinaceus. This effect of temperature on virus prevalence may have   been driven by vector abundance because the viruses are obligately   aphid-transmitted, and aphids were found more frequently in heated   plots.   Synthesis. Overall, our investigation experimentally demonstrates strong   combined impacts of biotic and abiotic factors on disease dynamics in a   grassland system.

Seasonality of rainfall can exert a strong influence on animal   condition and on hostparasite interactions. The body condition of   ruminants fluctuates seasonally in response to changes in energy   requirements, foraging patterns and resource availability, and seasonal   variation in parasite infections may further alter ruminant body   condition.   2. This study disentangles the effects of rainfall and gastrointestinal   parasite infections on springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) body condition   and determines how these factors vary among demographic groups.   3. Using data from four years and three study areas, we investigated (i)   the influence of rainfall variation, demographic factors and parasite   interactions on parasite prevalence or infection intensity, (ii) whether   parasitism or rainfall is a more important predictor of springbok body   condition and (iii) how parasitism and condition vary among study areas   along a rainfall gradient.   4. We found that increased parasite intensity is associated with reduced   body condition only for adult females. For all other demographic groups,   body condition was significantly related to prior rainfall and not to   parasitism. Rainfall lagged by two months had a positive effect on body   condition.   5. Adult females showed evidence of a `periparturient rise' in parasite   intensity and had higher parasite intensity and lower body condition   than adult males after parturition and during early lactation. After   juveniles were weaned, adult females had lower parasite intensity than   adult males. Sex differences in parasitism and condition may be due to   differences between adult females and males in the seasonal timing of   reproductive effort and its effects on host immunity, as well as   documented sex differences in vulnerability to predation.   6.

We evaluated   the net effect of both pathways on total shoot biomass (with and without   the hemiparasite) and shoot biomass of graminoids, forbs and ericaceous   shrubs using a removal experiment in three sites infested with the   annual Rhinanthus angustifolius, and three sites infested with the   biennial Pedicularis sylvatica. We addressed the potential importance of   litter effects by determination of litter quantity and quality, as well   as modeling N release during decomposition. In the second year after   removing the hemiparasites, total plant biomass at Rhinanthus sites was   24 \% higher in weeded plots than in control plots, while weeding had no   significant effect at Pedicularis sites. The increase in total biomass   following Rhinanthus removal was mainly due to a higher biomass of   graminoids. The amount of litter produced by Rhinanthus was only half of   that produced by Pedicularis; N contents were similar. The amount of N   in the litter was 9 and 30 \% of the amount removed by mowing for   Rhinanthus and Pedicularis sites, respectively. Within 2 months, about   45 \% of the N in both hemiparasitic litter types was released by   decomposition. Our results suggest that in addition to the suppression   of host biomass due to parasitism, positive litter feedbacks on host and   non-host biomass-via an increase in nutrient availability-also affect   plant community structure.

We use mathematical modeling to   evaluate the potential impacts of damselfly predation and temperature on   mosquito population dynamics. We model this predator-prey system along   an elevational gradient (749-1952 m elevation) and assess the effect of   1A degrees C and 2A degrees C climate warming scenarios as well as the   effects of El Nio and La Nia oscillations, on predator-prey dynamics.   Our results indicate that the strength of biotic resistance of native   predators on invasive prey may decrease with increasing temperature   because demographic rates of predator and prey are differentially   affected by temperature. Future warming could therefore increase the   abundance of invasive species by releasing them from predation pressure.   If the invasive species is a disease vector, these shifts could increase   the impact of disease on both humans and wildlife.",174,NO,IF,,,,,

Maximising the efficiency of control   strategies for reducing transmission risk requires as a first step the   understanding of the intrinsic population dynamics of vectors. We fitted   a set of density-dependent and density-independent models to the   long-term time series of six tropical mosquito species from northern   Australia. The models' strength of evidence was assessed using Akaike's   Information Criterion (AIC (c) ), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)   and jack-knifed cross-validation (C-V). Density dependence accounted for   more than 99\% of the model weight in all model-selection methods, with   the Gompertz-logistic (Cushing model) being the best-supported model for   all mosquito species (negative density feedback expressed even at low   densities). The second-most abundant species, Aedes vigilax (a saline   breeder), showed no spatial heterogeneity in its density-dependent   response, but the remaining five species had different intrinsic growth   rates across 11 study sites. Population densities of saline species were   high only during the late dry to early wet season following the highest   tides of the month or early flood rains when swamps were mostly saline,   whereas those of freshwater species were highest during the mid-wet and   mid-dry seasons. These findings demonstrate remarkably strong density   dependence in mosquito populations, but also suggest that environmental   drivers, such as rainfall and tides, are important in modifying seasonal   densities. Neglecting to account for strong density feedback in tropical   mosquito populations will clearly result in less effective control.",175,NO,IF,,,,,

Acer platanoides (Norway maple) is an important non-native invasive   canopy tree in North American deciduous forests, where native species   diversity and abundance are greatly reduced under its canopy. We   conducted a field experiment in North American forests to compare   planted seedlings of A. platanoides and Acer saccharum (sugar maple), a   widespread, common native that, like A. platanoides, is shade tolerant.   Over two growing seasons in three forests we compared multiple   components of seedling success: damage from natural enemies,   ecophysiology, growth and survival. We reasoned that equal or superior   performance by A. platanoides relative to A. saccharum indicates   seedling characteristics that support invasiveness, while inferior   performance indicates potential barriers to invasion.   2. Acer platanoides seedlings produced more leaves and allocated more   biomass to roots, A. saccharum had greater water use efficiency, and the   two species exhibited similar photosynthesis and first-season mortality   rates. Acer platanoides had greater winter survival and earlier spring   leaf emergence, but second-season mortality rates were similar.   3. The success of A. platanoides seedlings was not due to escape from   natural enemies, contrary to the enemy release hypothesis. Foliar insect   herbivory and disease symptoms were similarly high for both native and   non-native, and seedling biomass did not differ. Rather, A. platanoides   compared well with A. saccharum because of its equivalent ability to   photosynthesize in the low light herb layer, its higher leaf production   and greater allocation to roots, and its lower winter mortality coupled   with earlier spring emergence. Its only potential barrier to seedling   establishment, relative to A. saccharum, was lower water use efficiency,   which possibly could hinder its invasion into drier forests.   4. The spread of non-native canopy trees poses an especially serious   problem for native forest communities, because canopy trees strongly   influence species in all forest layers. Success at reaching the canopy   depends on a tree's ecology in previous life-history stages,   particularly as a vulnerable seedling, but little is known about   seedling characteristics that promote non-native tree invasion.   Experimental field comparison with ecologically successful native trees   provides insight into why non-native trees succeed as seedlings, which   is a necessary stage on their journey into the forest canopy.",176,NO,IF,,,,,

We present data   suggesting that free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) are a maintenance host   for Brucella abortus in new areas of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem   (GYE). Brucellosis seroprevalence in free-ranging elk increased from   0-7\% in 1991-1992 to 8-20\% in 2006-2007 in four of six herd units   around the GYE. These levels of brucellosis Lire comparable to sonic   herd units where elk are artificially aggregated on supplemental feeding   ground,,. There are several possible mechanisms for this increase that   we evaluated using statistical and population modeling approaches.   Simulations of an age-structured Population model suggest that the   observed levels of seroprevalence are unlikely to be sustained by   dispersal from supplemental feeding areas with relatively high   seroprevalence or an older age structure. Increases in brucellosis   seroprevalence and the total elk population size in areas with   feeding,rounds have not been statistically detectable. Meanwhile, the   rate of seroprevalence Increase Outside the feeding grounds was-related   to the population size and density of each herd unit. Therefore. the   data suggest that enhanced elk-to-elk transmission in free-ranging   populations may be Occurring due to larger winter elk aggregations. Elk   populations inside and Outside of the GYE that traditionally did not   maintain brucellosis may now be at risk due to recent population   increases. In particular. sonic neighboring Populations of Montana elk   were 5-9 times larger in 2007 than in the 1970s, with sonic aggregations   comparable to the Wyoming feeding-ground Populations. Addressing the   unintended consequences of these increasing populations is complicated   by limited hunter access to private lands, which places many ungulate   populations Out Of administrative control.

It is critical to achieve an   improved understanding of the community structure of the indigenous AM   fungi if we are to use this group of fungi either as indicators of   ecosystem health or to enhance the sustainability of agricultural   systems. In the present study, we assessed the impact of land use and   soil depth on the number and community composition of infective AM   fungal propagules in high-input agricultural ecosystems.   Three different agricultural land use systems with high management   intensity were selected, i.e., vegetable greenhouses, arable land, and   open vegetable fields.

The community composition of AM fungi was analyzed   using PCR, cloning, and sequencing techniques.   Land use and soil depth greatly influenced the development of   root-associated AM fungi and also edaphic properties. MIPs and species   richness were lower in the top (0-30 cm) of soil profile in the   vegetable greenhouses than in the nearby open vegetable fields or arable   fields. Moreover, AM fungal distribution in the soil profile varied with   land use. The MIPs and species richness decreased with increasing soil   depth in the arable land and open vegetable fields. By contrast, in the   greenhouse vegetable soils, the highest richness was found in the   deepest soil depth (60-90 cm).

Six European/Eurasian plant   species that recently colonized the Netherlands (non-natives), and six   related species (natives) from the Netherlands were selected.

However, the effect of   conspecific conditioned soil was negative compared to heterospecific   soil for natives, but was positive for non-natives. In both cases,   plant-soil interactions were not affected by temperature. Therefore, we   conclude that the temperature component of climate change does not   affect the direction, or strength of plant-soil feedback, neither for   native nor for non-native plant species.

A major land use change targeted for regulating climate and   biodiversity is peatland restoration. This will cause changes in   vegetation and, potentially, keystone species such as large herbivores,   which are the main hosts to Ixodes ricinus (L.) ticks, the most   important vector of disease-causing pathogens in Europe.   This study tested the impact of restoring peatlands from conifer   forestry on Ixodes ricinus abundance and explored the likely mechanisms.   Large-scale surveys of Ixodes ricinus, vertebrate herbivores and   vegetation were conducted in adjacent areas of forest, bog and areas   felled 5-13years previously.   Questing tick abundance was greatest in forest and almost absent from   blanket bog, with intermediate numbers in felled areas, where ticks were   more abundant in young than in old felled areas.   The likely mechanisms for these variations in tick abundance were deer   habitat preferences (bog was the least preferred habitat) and ground   vegetation height or canopy cover, which are generally associated with   alternative tick hosts and micro-climates that aid tick questing and   survival.   Synthesis and applications. Felling conifer forest to restore peatlands   could produce a dramatic decline in tick abundance throughout the   restoration process, with implications for disease risk. Therefore, a   further ecosystem service of peatlands in addition to climate,   biodiversity and water regulation is regulating pests and disease.

Arid Australia has the world's worst   modern mammalian extinction record, largely attributable to competition   from introduced herbivores, particularly European rabbits (Oryctolagus   cuniculus) and predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes   vulpes). The biological control agent rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus   (RHDV) was introduced to Australia in 1995 and resulted in dramatic,   widespread rabbit suppression. We compared the area of occupancy and   extent of occurrence of 4 extant species of small mammals before and   after RHDV outbreak, relative to rainfall, sampling effort, and rabbit   and predator populations. Despite low rainfall during the first 14 years   after RHDV, 2 native rodents listed by the International Union for   Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the dusky hopping-mouse (Notomys fuscus)   and plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), increased their extent of   occurrence by 241-365\%. A threatened marsupial micropredator, the   crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), underwent a 70-fold   increase in extent of occurrence and a 20-fold increase in area of   occupancy. Both bottom-up and top-down trophic effects were attributed   to RHDV, namely decreased competition for food resources and declines in   rabbit-dependent predators. Based on these sustained increases, these 3   previously threatened species now qualify for threat-category   downgrading on the IUCN Red List. These recoveries are on a scale rarely   documented in mammals and give impetus to programs aimed at targeted use   of RHDV in Australia, rather than simply employing top-down threat-based   management of arid ecosystems. Conservation programs that take   big-picture approaches to addressing threatening processes over large   spatial scales should be prioritized to maximize return from scarce   conservation funding.

La zona arida de Australia tiene el   peor registro moderno de extincion de mamiferos del mundo, en su mayoria   atribuible a la competencia con los herbivoros introducidos,   particularmente el conejo europeo (Oryctolagus cuniculus), y a la   depredacion por parte de los gatos ferales (Felis catus) y los zorros   (Vulpes vulpes). El agente de control biologico VEHC (virus de la   enfermedad hemorragica de conejos) se introdujo a Australia en 1995 y   resulto en una represion dramatica y extendida de los conejos.   Comparamos el area de ocupacion y la extension de la presencia de cuatro   especies existentes de mamiferos pequenos antes y despues de la epidemia   de VEHC en relacion a la lluvia, esfuerzo de muestreo y poblaciones de   conejos y depredadores. A pesar de la poca lluvia durante los primeros   14 anos despues del VEHC, dos roedores nativos enlistados por la Union   Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza (UICN), la rata   canguro (Notomys fuscus) y el raton de las praderas (Pseudomys   australis), incrementaron su extension en un 241-365\%. Un   micro-depredador marsupial amenazado, la rata marsupial de cola crestada   (Dasycercus cristicauda), experimento un incremento de 70 veces en la   extension de su presencia y una de 20 veces en el area de ocupacion.   Ambos efectos troficos de abajo-hacia-arriba y de arriba-hacia-abajo   fueron atribuidos al VEHC, especificamente la competencia reducida por   los recursos alimenticios y la declinacion de depredadores dependientes   de los conejos. Con base en estos incrementos prolongados, estas tres   especies previamente amenazadas ahora califican para una baja de   categoria en la Lista Roja de la UICN.

Specifically, we investigated associations   between tree-level variables (duration and location of white pine   blister rust infection, presence of mountain pine beetle, tree size, and   potential interactions) with observations of individual whitebark pine   tree mortality. Climate summaries indicated that cumulative growing   degree days in years 2006-2008 likely contributed to a regionwide   outbreak of mountain pine beetle prior to the observed peak in whitebark   mortality in 2009. We show that larger whitebark pine trees were   preferentially attacked and killed by mountain pine beetle and resulted   in a regionwide shift to smaller size class trees. In addition, we found   evidence that smaller size class trees with white pine blister rust   infection experienced higher mortality than larger trees. This latter   finding suggests that in the coming decades white pine blister rust may   become the most probable cause of whitebark pine mortality. Our findings   offered no evidence of an interactive effect of mountain pine beetle and   white pine blister rust infection on whitebark pine mortality in the   Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Interestingly, the probability of   mortality was lower for larger trees attacked by mountain pine beetle in   stands with higher evapotranspiration. Because evapotranspiration varies   with climate and topoedaphic conditions across the region, we discuss   the potential to use this improved understanding of biophysical   influences on mortality to identify microrefugia that might contribute   to successful whitebark pine conservation efforts.

Here, we used three versions   of a freshwater pond food web with varying levels of node resolution   (from taxonomic species to life stages) to examine how complex life   cycles and parasites alter web properties, the perceived trophic   position of organisms, and the fit of a probabilistic niche model.   Consistent with prior studies, parasites increased most measures of web   complexity in the taxonomic species web; however, when nodes were   disaggregated into life stages, the effects of parasites on several   network properties (e.g., connectance and nestedness) were reversed, due   in part to the lower trophic generality of parasite life stages relative   to free-living life stages. Disaggregation also reduced the trophic   level of organisms with either complex or direct life cycles and was   particularly useful when including predation on parasites, which can   inflate trophic positions when life stages are collapsed. Contrary to   predictions, disaggregation decreased network intervality and did not   enhance the fit of a probabilistic niche model to the food webs with   parasites. Although the most useful level of biological organization in   food webs will vary with the questions of interest, our results suggest   that disaggregating species-level nodes may refine our perception of how   parasites and other complex life cycle organisms influence ecological   networks.",185,NO,IF,,,,,

We used pellet abundance indices to estimate   rabbit density in 118 surveys conducted during the summers of 2002 and   2003.

In many   cases, these infection-induced life-history changes are driven by   changes in the pattern of energy allocation and utilization within the   host. Because these processes will affect both host and parasite   fitness, it can be challenging to determine who benefits from them.   Determining the causes and consequences of infection-induced   life-history changes requires the ability to experimentally manipulate   life history and a framework for connecting life history to host and   parasite fitness. Here, we combine a novel starvation manipulation with   energy budget models to provide new insights into castration and   gigantism in the Daphnia magna-Pasteuria ramosa host-parasite system.   Our results show that starvation primarily affects investment in   reproduction, and increasing starvation stress reduces gigantism and   parasite fitness without affecting castration. These results are   consistent with an energetic structure where the parasite uses growth   energy as a resource. This finding gives us new understanding of the   role of castration and gigantism in this system, and how life-history   variation will affect infection outcome and epidemiological dynamics.

We   compared community diversity, functional composition, and body size of   two common species using ichneumonid specimens collected in 1961-1965,   1980-1982, 1989-1992, and 2010. We found high compositional similarity   between collections, overlapping estimates of species richness, no   change in the proportion of idiobiont genera in the community, and no   clear pattern in body size over time. The greatest amount of variation   over time was detected in parasitoids of herbivores; proportionally   fewer herbivore-parasitizing genera were found in 2010 than in   historical collections, and the two genera that were only found in one   of the four collections were both parasitoids of herbivores. Our results   point to the need to assess climate change effects in Arctic systems   using a range of taxa, and responses to large-scale environmental   disturbances may be idiosyncratic and difficult to predict.",188,NO,IF,,,,,

Mixing of water masses in the dark   ocean occurs on a global scale and may have far reaching consequences   for the different prokaryotic and virus communities found in these   waters by altering the environmental conditions these communities   experience. We hypothesize that mixing of deep ocean water masses   enhances the lytic activity of viruses infecting prokaryotes. To address   this hypothesis, major deep-sea water masses of the Atlantic Ocean such   as North Atlantic Deep Water, Mediterranean Sea Overflow Water,   Antarctic Intermediate Water, and Antarctic Bottom Water were sampled at   five locations. Prokaryotic cells from these samples were collected by   filtration and subsequently incubated in virus-reduced water from either   the same (control) or a different water mass (transplantation   treatment). Additionally, mixtures of prokaryotes obtained from two   different water masses were incubated in a mixture of virus-reduced   water from the same water masses (control) or in virus-reduced water   from the source water masses separately (mixing treatments). Pronounced   differences in productivity-related parameters (prokaryotic leucine   incorporation, prokaryotic and viral abundance) between water masses   caused strong changes in viral lysis of prokaryotes. Often, mixing of   water masses increased viral lysis of prokaryotes, indicating that   lysogenic viruses were induced into the lytic cycle. Mixing-induced   changes in viral lysis had a strong effect on the community composition   of prokaryotes and viruses. Our data show that mixing of deep-sea water   masses alters levels of viral lysis of prokaryotes and in many cases   weakens the efficiency of the microbial loop by enhancing the recycling   of organic carbon in the deep ocean.",189,NO,IF,,,,,

Prior   social science research on this topic is limited and has emphasized   feral cats even though owned cats often comprise a large proportion of   the outdoor cat population, particularly in urban areas. To address this   gap, we examined public risk perceptions and attitudes toward outdoor   pet cats across varying levels of urbanization, including along the   wildland-urban interface, in Colorado (U.S.A.), through a mail survey of   1397 residents. Residents did not view all types of risks uniformly.   They viewed risks of cat predation on wildlife and carnivore predation   on cats as more likely than disease-related risks. Additionally, risk   perceptions were related to attitudes, prior experiences with cats and   cat-wildlife interactions, and cat-owner behavior. Our findings suggest   that changes in risk perceptions may result in behavior change.   Therefore, knowledge of cat-related risk perceptions and attitudes could   be used to develop communication programs aimed at promoting   risk-aversive behaviors among cat owners and cat-management strategies   that are acceptable to the public and that directly advance the   conservation of native species.

Invasive organisms and emerging wildlife disease pose two of the   greatest threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.   2. Typically, when parasites are considered in invasion biology, it is   in the context of the enemy release hypothesis, wherein a non-indigenous   species has greater probability of invasion success by virtue of leaving   its natural enemies, including parasites, behind.   3. It is also possible that native parasites may prevent invasions, but   it is clear that invasive organisms may bring infectious diseases with   them that can infect native competitors (via spillover), or act as   competent hosts for native diseases, increasing disease prevalence among   native species (via spillback).   4. If the shared disease (either via spillover or spillback) has higher   virulence in the native host (which is particularly likely with   introduced parasites), there is the potential that the disease can act   as a biological weapon leading to a disease-mediated invasion (DMI).   5. Here, we review cases where disease may have been an important factor   mediating a wide range of invasions in vertebrates, invertebrates and   plants.   6. We then focus on the invasion of the grey squirrel into the UK as a   case study of a DMI, and we discuss how mathematical models have helped   us to understand the importance of this shared disease and its   implications for the management of invasive species.   7. We conclude that (i) DMIs are a widespread phenomenon, that (ii)   spillover is more common in animal invasions and spillback more common   among plant invasions and that (iii) spillover DMIs are particularly   important in explaining the replacement of native animals with   phylogenetically similar non-indigenous species.",191,NO,IF,,,,,

The role of   biofilms in recognizing the parental habitat is unknown for the   ecologically and economically important mangrove crab Ucides cordatus, a   species suffering from environmental pressures such as habitat   degradation and disease. In the laboratdry, we experimentally tested the   influence of biofilms grown in offshore and estuarine waters on the   moulting rates and developmental time to metamorphosis (TIN) of the last   larval stage (megalopa) of U. cordatus. Here, we specifically studied   whether: (i) megalopae of this larval-exporting species respond   differently to marine (MB) and estuarine biofilms (EB), (ii) biofilms   previously immersed (24 h) in adult crab-conditioned seawater (ACSW;   i.e. conspecific chemical cues) exhibit a greater effectiveness (i.e. by   inducing higher moulting rates and shorter TTM) on larval metamorphosis   than non-immersed ones and (iii) biofilms pre-immersed (24 h) in ACSW   decrease their effectiveness when incubated (24 h) in pure filtered   seawater (FSW) before offering them to megalopae. U. cordatus megalopae   metamorphosed to the first juvenile crab stage (Jl) in response to both   MB and EB, however the moulting rates were significantly higher and   development TTM shorter in the presence of EB compared to MB. The   metamorphosis-inducing effects were significantly enhanced when both   types of biofilms were pre-immersed in ACSW, suggesting that conspecific   cues can be absorbed and stored by microbial matrix. The higher   inductiveness of EB compared to MB persisted after previous contact with   ACSW. Furthermore, EB exhibited a significantly greater biomass   production (measured as dry weight) than MB, and when immersed in ACSW,   both groups of biofilms significantly increased in biomass (maintaining   the hierarchy EB > MB), suggesting that water-soluble chemical   substances emitted by the adult crabs may have been absorbed and   metabolized by the biofilms. The metamorphic inductiveness and biomass   production decreased when both groups of biofilms that were previously   kept (24 h) in ACSW were thereafter immersed (24 h) in FSW. All   megalopae successfully moulted toil after accelerated TTM when reared in   ACSW, regardless of presence or absence of biofilms, corroborating that   conspecific stimuli are the most effective metamorphosis-stimulating   cues tested so far in U. cordatus. The fact that EB improved the   moulting rates and shortened the development TTM indicates that   megalopae can recognize and respond to microbial assemblages typical for   specific environments. This should be ecologically important during   larval recruitment by facilitating settlement in appropriate habitats   for the post-metamorphic development of early benthic recruits. In   addition, the influence of EB could encourage colonization of new   estuarine areas and aid natural recovery of U. cordatus in mangrove   habitats where crab populations have suffered significant reduction due   to deforestation, fishing pressure or diseases.

Castle del Conte",2017,Methyl jasmonate induction of cotton: a field test of the `attract and   reward' strategy of conservation biological control,AOB PLANTS,NA,NA,10.1093/aobpla/plx032,"Natural or synthetic elicitors can affect plant physiology by   stimulating direct and indirect defence responses to herbivores. For   example, increased production of plant secondary metabolites, a direct   response, can negatively affect herbivore survival, development and   fecundity. Indirect responses include increased emission of plant   volatiles that influence herbivore and natural enemy behaviour, and   production of extrafloral nectar that serves as a food source for   natural enemies after their arrival on induced plants. Therefore, the   use of elicitors has potential for the study of basic aspects of   tritrophic interactions, as well as application in biorational pest   control, i.e. an `attract and reward' strategy. We conducted a field   study to investigate the effects of methyl jasmonate, an elicitor of   plant defence responses, on three trophic levels: the plant, herbivores   and natural enemies. We made exogenous applications of methyl jasmonate   to transgenic cotton and measured volatile emission, extrafloral nectar   production and plant performance (yield). We also assessed insect   abundance, insect performance, and parasitism and predation of brown   stink bug, Euschistus servus, eggs in methyl jasmonate- treated and   untreated control plots. Application of methyl jasmonate increased   emission of volatiles, in particular, (+)-limonene and   (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, and production of extrafloral   nectar, but not yield, compared with the control treatment. Despite   increased volatile and extrafloral nectar production, methyl jasmonate   application did not affect plant bug performance, or mortality of E.   servus egg masses, and only marginally influenced insect abundance.   Mortality of E. servus eggs varied over the course of the study.   Overall, methyl jasmonate treatment affected cotton plantinduced   responses, but not the insects that inhabit the plants. Our results were   probably influenced by reduced natural enemy colonization of cotton from   adjacent non-crop habitats, and subsequent low within-field population   recruitment. Much remains to be learned about the effects of exogenous   application of plant-produced `enhancers' on the behaviour of natural   enemies before crop physiology can be manipulated to enhance pest   control.",193,NO,IF,,,,,

In particular, the outcomes may be dependent on the   density of the partners with unimodal or saturating outcomes providing   stability to the mutualism. We examine density-dependent outcomes of an   obligate, species-specific mutualism between a South African carnivorous   plant (Roridula dentata) and a hemipteran (Pameridea) that facilitates   prey digestion, but also sucks plant sap. Plants occur in sandy,   leached, nitrogen-poor soils and have no digestive enzymes to digest   prey. Instead they rely on obligately dependent hemipterans to supply   nitrogen by digesting prey for them and defecating on their leaves. We   documented the densities of Pameridea on Roridula in the field. In the   greenhouse, we manipulated the hemipteran densities on Roridula and   measured the mean relative growth rates of plants with differing   hemipteran densities. Plants exhibited a unimodal response to the   density of their mutualist partners. Those with no hemipterans had   negative growth rates, suggesting that hemipterans are important in   facilitating nitrogen absorption. Plants with intermediate hemipteran   densities had positive growth rates but growth rates were negative under   very high hemipteran densities. Our research provides support for   variable and unimodal outcomes in mutualism. Unimodal outcomes may be   particularly important in obligate mutualisms and this is one of the few   studied outside of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms. In this system,   extrinsic factors such as other predators may affect the mutualism by   altering the numbers of hemipterans.",194,NO,IF,,,,,

We conducted a 4-year   study combining field observations and pollination experiments to   evaluate the major factors causing variation in seed production of   Primula modesta at two sites (fen and grassy sites) on Mt Asama in   central Japan. Primula modesta switched from a vegetative to   reproductive life phase at a stage that depended on its accumulation of   biomass, and the number of flowers produced by each plant was also   highly correlated with plant size. Plants at the grassy site, where snow   melts 2-3 weeks earlier than at the fen site, can accumulate more   biomass and, thus, bear more flowers and ovules than those at the fen   site. Although P. modesta is distylous with both self and intramorph   incompatibility, pollen availability did not limit seed production at   either site. Annual seed production was relatively constant at both   sites over the four seasons except 2002, but it was influenced by many   environmental factors, including stochastic events, and by antagonistic   interactions with herbivores and pathogens. In 2002, many flowers failed   to bloom at the fen site. This was likely caused by frost damage to   flower buds because of an unusually early snowmelt in that year. Unusual   climatic events may be a crucial factor causing spatial and temporal   variation in seed production at our study sites. Longer-term   observations are needed to evaluate the effect of unusual climatic   events on reproduction.",195,NO,IF,,,,,

Parasites are ubiquitous in ecosystems, but their roles in material   transfer are poorly understood. Fungal parasites in freshwater   ecosystems are of major importance to small heterotrophic eukaryotes and   consume large phytoplankton that are resistant to zooplankton grazing.   2. To evaluate their ecosystem-level effects, we developed a simple food   web model that incorporates competition between small and large   phytoplankton for nutrients, zooplankton grazing on small phytoplankton,   fungal parasitism on large phytoplankton and includes a newly discovered   trophic link from fungal zoospores to zooplankton (F-Z link).   3. Our model demonstrates the likely occurrence of an indirect mutualism   between fungi and zooplankton, in which fungal parasitism increases   zooplankton production by reducing the biomass of inedible large   phytoplankton. Contradicting the expectation from a previous short-term   experiment that the F-Z link may benefit zooplankton, the presence of   the F-Z link can reduce material transfer from phytoplankton to   zooplankton because of the negative effect of the indirect mutualism.   The model indicates that high growth efficiency of fungi on host tissue   and their high nutrient status for zooplankton are crucial for the F-Z   link to increase zooplankton production.   4. The model also indicates that the contribution of material transfer   via F-Z link to zooplankton increases with nutrient availability. Our   results suggest that parasitic fungi may be a key player in material   transfer, especially in eutrophic ecosystems.",196,NO,IF,,,,,

Yet, other studies   have shown no effect of predator diversity on prey mortality, or even   negative effects (for example due to intraguild predation or   interference). Much research emphasis has been placed on the traits of   predators that maximise functional complementarity. However,   comparatively less attention has been paid to the traits of the prey or   habitat that may maximise predator diversity effects, even though there   must be a variety of prey niches available to be partitioned in order   for niche complementarity to occur. Following this logic, we review six   hypotheses for when diverse enemy assemblages should be most effective:   when 1) prey communities are diverse; 2) prey have complex life cycles;   3) prey are patchily distributed in space or time; 4) studies are   conducted at larger spatial and temporal scales; 5) plant structures are   complex; 6) prey are abundant. Many of these hypotheses lack direct   tests, particularly in agricultural systems, but we find little or no   direct or indirect support for hypotheses 1, 4, 5 and 6.

Contaminant removal performance differs by constituent, with   the advantage to FWS for moderate to high biochemical oxygen demand   (BOD), TSS, ammonia, total nitrogen and phosphorus. HSSF are more   effective for tertiary BOD levels, nitrate and pathogens. Superpositions   of the loading data show that the respective data clouds overlap   virtually entirely for HSSF and FWS wetlands. There is little or no   performance difference when they are compared on this areal basis. In   general, there is little or no advantage of HSSF for space saving. In   cold climates, HSSF systems are less cold sensitive, and easier to   insulate for winter operation. The use of winter storage enables FWS to   be used in freezing conditions, but the cost makes that option   comparable to the more expensive HSSF. In general, economics do not   favor the choice of HSSF wetlands. Factors other than reduction   performance are also important in the selection process. Other principal   reasons for selecting the HSSF option over the FWS option are prevention   of human health contact problems, mosquito control and minimization of   wildlife interactions.

To   counteract these defensive plant secondary metabolites, cotton bollworms   (Helicoverpa armigera) elevate their production of detoxification   enzymes, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s). Besides their   tolerance to phytotoxin, cotton bollworms have quickly developed   resistance to deltamethrin, a widely used pyrethroid insecticide in   cotton field. However, the relationship between host plant secondary   metabolites and bollworm insecticide resistance is poorly understood.   Here, we show that exogenously expressed CYP6AE14, a gossypol-inducible   P450 of cotton bollworm, has epoxidation activity towards aldrin, an   organochlorine insecticide, indicating that gossypol-induced P450s   participate in insecticide metabolism. Gossypol-ingested cotton bollworm   larvae showed higher midgut P450 enzyme activities and exhibited   enhanced tolerance to deltamethrin. The midgut transcripts of bollworm   larvae administrated with different phytochemicals and deltamethrin were   then compared by microarray analysis, which showed that gossypol and   deltamethrin induced the most similar P450 expression profiles.   Gossypol-induced P450s exhibited high divergence and at least five of   them (CYP321A1, CYP9A12, CYP9A14, CYP6AE11 and CYP6B7) contributed to   cotton bollworm tolerance to deltamethrin. Knocking down one of them,   CYP9A14, by plant-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) rendered the larvae   more sensitive to the insecticide. These data demonstrate that   generalist insects can take advantage of secondary metabolites from   their major host plants to elaborate defence systems against other toxic   chemicals, and impairing this defence pathway by RNAi holds a potential   for reducing the required dosages of agrochemicals in pest control.",200,NO,IF,,,,,

Along a precipitation   gradient from the Cape of South Africa to northern Namibia we trapped   470 mice over a geographical distance of about 1400 km. Faecal egg   counts of 439 sampled individuals and dissections of 161   gastro-intestinal tracts revealed 15 different helminth species. The   most abundant nematode species harboured in 62.6\% of all infected mice   were the oxyurid Syphacia obvelata followed jointly by two species   (Heligmonina spira and Neoheligmonella capensis) of the subfamily   Nippostrongylinae (43.7\%). We found a significant positive correlation   between mean annual precipitation (rainfall and relative humidity) and   nematode infestation rates of animals and a negative correlation with   temperature. In addition, we found associations between precipitation   and different qualitative measurements of parasite burden (mean nematode   species richness, mean number of nematode worms and infection intensity   per individual host). The similarity in nematode species composition   decreased with distance between all study sites. Our study indicates for   the first time an association between climatic variables and parasite   prevalence and abundance along a continuous natural climatic gradient in   a small mammal. These results might be incorporated in the development   of models which can predict possible threats for the balance of   ecosystems and shifts in infestation patterns due to global changes.",204,NO,IF,,,,,

The effects of microbes on   their environment can be beneficial or harmful or inapparent with regard   to human measure or observation. The most significant effect of the   microbes on earth is their ability to recycle the primary elements that   make up all living systems, especially carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen (N).   Primary production involves photosynthetic organisms which take up CO2   from the atmosphere and convert it to organic (cellular) material. The   process is also called CO2 fixation, and it accounts for a very large   portion of organic carbon available for synthesis of cell material.   Decomposition or biodegradation results in the breakdown of complex   organic materials to other forms of carbon that can be used by other   organisms. There is no naturally occurring organic compound that cannot   be degraded by some microbe, although some synthetic compounds such as   Teflon, plastics, insecticides, and pesticides are broken down very   slowly or not at all. Through the microbial metabolic processes of   fermentation and respiration, organic molecules are eventually broken   down to CO2 which is returned to the atmosphere for continuous process   of primary production. Biological nitrogen fixation is a process found   only in some bacteria which remove N-2 from the atmosphere and converts   it to ammonia (NH3), for use by the plants and animals. Nitrogen   fixation also results in replenishment of soil nitrogen removed by   agricultural processes. Thus along with all these benefits, microbes   greatly contribute in maintaining sustainability of environment. This   chapter mainly focuses on beneficial and harmful impacts of microbes on   environment and their role to maintain quality, health, and   sustainability of environment.",206,NO,IF,,,,,

During winter, plant flower are often   used as mono specific ground cover and are expected to die before   flowering as a result of recurrent frost events. Decreases in minimal   temperature due to climate change offers new possibilities for plants   used in such sown cover crops to mature and flowers. Changes in plant   phenology thus constitute an important environmental change with   expected consequences for ecosystem functioning, such as biological   control. In Brittany, where winter agricultural landscape is dominated   by a mosaic of cereal and sown cover crops, we assessed the consequences   of mustard (Synapis alba) flowering cover crops (MFCC) on aphid   parasitism and food web structure in plots adjoining cereal crops, in   contrast to plots close to spontaneous non-crop plants (SNCP) of the   same field. Overall, aphid parasitism rate at the field scale was strong   (60-70\%), being 13\% higher adjacent to the MFCC than closer to SNCP.   In addition, there was no change in food web structure between the two   distinct zones, enabling us to hypothesize that MFCC mostly constituted   an alimentary patch. The positive effect on parasitism rate was   significant but weak, as floral nectar of mustard is known to be of poor   quality for parasitoids. Results highlight the potential advantages of   adapting practices in response to actual changes in agrosystems.   Increase floral diversity in sown cover crops could constitute a   complementary method in management programs, by providing more   alternative food resources, alternative hosts, and climatic refuge to   enhance the Conservation Biological Control of parasitoid populations.",207,NO,IF,,,,,

We extend the application of the telecoupling framework   to illustrate how flows in beef affect and are affected by   social-ecological processes occurring between distant systems in Africa,   and how those dynamics will likely change over the next few decades   because of climate-induced shifts in a major bovine disease,   trypanosomosis.

Increasing temperatures are predicted to substantially   reduce the geographic range of the cattle disease by 2050 in regions of   Africa, thereby potentially releasing cattle from disease control in   those areas. Despite the societal and economic benefits, greater cattle   production can also lead to significant environmental degradation. Our   investigation takes a qualitative, yet systematic, approach to explore   how changes in the regional distribution of cattle production, caused by   shifts in the bovine disease, will affect the social and ecological   conditions of the telecoupled system in the future.

In one of the most successful cryptic plant invasions in   North America, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the displacement   of native Phragmites australis by its Eurasian counterpart. Since   invasive Phragmites' populations have been especially prolific along   eutrophic shorelines, we conducted a two-year field experiment involving   native and invasive genotypes that manipulated nutrient level and   competitor identity (inter-and intra-genotypic competition) to assess   their relative importance in driving the loss of native Phragmites.   Inter-genotypic competition suppressed aboveground biomass of both   native and invasive plants regardless of nutrient treatment (similar to   27\%), while nutrient addition disproportionately enhanced the   aboveground biomass (by 67\%) and lateral expansion (by > 3 x farther)   of invasive Phragmites. Excavation of experimental plots indicated that   nutrient addition generates these differences in aboveground growth by   differentially affecting rhizome production in invasive vs native   plants; invasive rhizome biomass and rhizome length increased by 595\%   and 32\% with nutrient addition, respectively, while natives increased   by only 278\% and 15\%. Regardless of nutrient level, native rhizomes   produced twice as many roots compared to invasives, which field surveys   revealed are heavily infected with mycorrhizal symbionts. These results   suggest that native Phragmites competes well under nutrient-limited   conditions because its rhizomes are laden with nutrient-harvesting roots   and mycorrhizae. Invasive Phragmites' vigorous aboveground response to   nutrients and scarcity of lateral roots, in contrast, may reflect its   historic distribution in eutrophic Eurasian wetlands and correspond to   its prevalence in New England marshes characterized by elevated nutrient   availability and relaxed nutrient competition. These findings reveal   that discrete differences in phenotype can interact with anthropogenic   modification of environmental conditions to help explain the success of   cryptic invaders.",210,NO,IF,,,,,

We present the first experimental evidence in support of this   hypothesis, using seven woody neotropical species.   We transplanted seedlings that had recently expanded their first   photosynthetic cotyledon or leaf to the forest understorey (1\% of full   sun) and quantified initial biomass and total non-structural   carbohydrate (TNC) in stems, roots and storage cotyledons. We then   randomly assigned seedlings to control and two stress treatments: light   reduction (0.08\% of full sun for 8 weeks) and complete defoliation.   First-year survival of control seedlings, a comparative measure of shade   tolerance, differed widely among species. The two stress treatments   reduced survival and relative growth rates (RGR) of all species.   Shade-tolerant species were little impacted by the stress treatments,   whereas the two least shade-tolerant species experienced 100\%   mortality.   In all treatments, 8-week and first-year survival was positively   correlated with initial TNC pool size in stems and roots. By contrast,   survival was generally not correlated with initial TNC concentration in   any organ, TNC pools in cotyledons, seed mass or seedling biomass.   TNC in stems and roots, but not in cotyledons, decreased in response to   light reduction and defoliation over 8 weeks. Leaf area recovery of   defoliated seedlings was positively correlated with initial TNC pools in   stems and roots.   First-year survival in each treatment was negatively correlated with 0-8   week RGR of control seedlings, suggesting higher stress tolerance of   species with inherently slow growth rates in shade. RGR of control   seedlings from 0 to 8 weeks was negatively correlated with initial TNC   pools, but not concentrations, in stems and roots. After 8 weeks, RGR   was positive for all species, without clear relationships with survival   or TNC.   We conclude that carbohydrate storage in stems and roots enhances   long-term survival in shade by enabling seedlings to cope with periods   of biotic and abiotic stress. Carbohydrate storage is a key functional   trait that can explain species differences in growth and survival that   lead to species coexistence through niche assembly processes and   life-history trade-offs.",212,NO,IF,,,,,

We studied the energetic costs   of mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in wolves (Canis lupus) using thermal   cameras to estimate heat losses associated with compromised insulation   during the winter. We combined the field data of known, naturally   infected wolves with a data set on captive wolves with shaved patches of   fur as a positive control to simulate mange-induced hair loss. We   predict that during the winter in Montana, more severe mange infection   increases heat loss by around 5.2-12 MJ per night (1,240-2,850 kcal, or   a 65-78\% increase) for small and large wolves, respectively, accounting   for wind effects. To maintain body temperature would require a   significant proportion of a healthy wolf's total daily energy demands   (18-22 MJ/day). We also predict how these thermal costs may increase in   colder climates by comparing our predictions in Bozeman, Montana to   those from a place with lower ambient temperatures (Fairbanks, Alaska).   Contrary to our expectations, the 14 degrees C differential between   these regions was not as important as the potential differences in wind   speed. These large increases in energetic demands can be mitigated by   either increasing consumption rates or decreasing other energy demands.   Data from GPS-collared wolves indicated that healthy wolves move, on   average, 17 km per day, which was reduced by 1.5, 1.8, and 6.5 km for   light, medium, and severe hair loss. In addition, the wolf with the most   hair loss was less active at night and more active during the day, which   is the converse of the movement patterns of healthy wolves. At the   individual level, mange infections create significant energy demands and   altered behavioral patterns, this may have cascading effects on prey   consumption rates, food web dynamics, predator-prey interactions, and   scavenger communities.",213,NO,IF,,,,,

Pathogens and   predators are two classes of consumer that exhibit differences in   ecologically important traits (e. g., size, resource acquisition   strategy, foraging location) that could lead to complementary effects on   shared prey/hosts. To examine this possibility, we manipulated diversity   among a community of predators and pathogens that together attack an   herbivorous beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and measured resulting   effects on herbivore suppression and resulting plant damage. We found   that herbivore mortality increased, and plant damage decreased, when   more natural enemy species were present. However, closer examination   revealed that it was the pairing of predator with pathogen species,   rather than greater biodiversity per se, that strengthened herbivore   suppression. In this community, predators occur aboveground, attacking   herbivore juvenile stages feeding on plant foliage, whereas pathogens   occur belowground and attack herbivores pupating in the soil. In a   subsequent field experiment, we tracked the emergence of   predator-pathogen complementarity throughout the course of beetle   development. We found that herbivores exposed to predators aboveground   were more susceptible to subsequent pathogen infection belowground,   consistent with our observation in the laboratory that predator exposure   weakens beetles' immune response. Thus, predators facilitated resource   capture by pathogens, perhaps reflecting an inherent conflict for the   herbivore in allocating energetic resources toward anti-predator vs.   anti-pathogen defenses. Our results suggest that predator-pathogen   combinations were particularly taxing not because the consumer species   partitioned resources among themselves, but instead because they   enforced the partitioning of resources internal to prey/host   individuals.",218,NO,IF,plant damage,,,,

Cow-calf operations, goats for   meat, and sheep for wool are the dominant production systems under   continuous grazing. Rest-rotational grazing systems improved the   efficiency of the current cow-calf production. Forage resources are   primarily composed of perennial grasses and woody species. Rain-use   efficiency for the total vegetation ranged from 3.9 to 4.8 kg DM ha(-1)   year(-1) mm(-1). Carrying capacity showed a broad range: 18.7, 4.5-64.5,   and 21.6-89.3 ha AU(-1) in the north, central, and south portions of the   Monte, respectively. Mean crude protein (CP) content of grasses varied   from 8.4 to 10.3 (wet season) and 7.1-3.7\% DM (dry season) in the   central west and Patagonia, respectively. Grasses predominated in the   cattle diet, while the sheep diet was highly diverse because they ate   most of the available plant species, and there was no unanimity as to   the fact that goats are strictly browsers. Livestock diseases have lower   prevalence indices than those recorded in other areas of the country.   The high variability in carrying capacity values could be attributed to   differences in rangeland condition and to the different methods used for   its estimation. The CP levels in forage could meet cattle requirements   provided that a proper-stocking rate were used. The most promising   species for land rehabilitation are Opuntia, Atriplex spp., Eragrostis   curvula and Cenchrus ciliaris. Priorities for future research should   include topics such as assessment of the carrying capacity for most of   the areas and nutrient content of the components of livestock diet, the   livestock intake values, the economic feasibility of the use of   complementary feeds and the development of seeding technology for   valuable forage resources as Trichloris crinita, among others.

This study's goal was to map and monitor cheatgrass   performance to identify where and when cheatgrass dieoff occurred in the   Northern Great Basin and to discover how this phenomenon was affected by   climatic, topographic, and edaphic variables. We also examined how fire   affected cheatgrass performance. Land managers and scientists are   concerned by cheatgrass dieoff because it can increase land degradation,   and its causes and effects are not fully known. To better understand the   scope of cheatgrass dieoff, we developed multiple ecological models that   integrated remote sensing data with geophysical and biophysical data.   Themodels' R-2 ranged from 0.71 to 0.88, and their root mean squared   errors (RMSEs) ranged from 3.07 to 6.95. Validation of dieoff data   showed that 41\% of pixels within independently developed dieoff   polygons were accurately classified as dieoff, whereas 2\% of pixels   outside of dieoff polygons were classified as dieoff. Site potential, a   long-term spatial average of cheatgrass cover, dominated the development   of the cheatgrass performance model. Fire negatively affected cheatgrass   performance 1 year postfire, but by the second year postfire performance   exceeded prefire levels. The landscape-scale monitoring study presented   in this paper helps increase knowledge about recent rangeland dynamics,   including where cheatgrass dieoffs occurred and how cheatgrass responded   to fire. This knowledge can help direct further investigation and/or   guide land management activities that can capitalize on, or mitigate the   effects of, cheatgrass dieoff.

Pathogenicity results from feeding studies with the nematode   Caenorhabditis elegans as host confirmed that these strains were   pathogenic, with Salmonella-fed C. elegans dying faster (mean survival   time between 3 and 4 days) than controls, i.e., Escherichia coli-fed C.   elegans (mean survival time of 9.5 days).

Ten-fold higher cell numbers of Salmonella inoculated into water or into   biofilm resulted in similar patterns of population dynamics, though   cells in biofilms remained detectable with numbers around 10(4) cells   cm(-2) after 4 weeks. Independent of detectability by qPCR, samples of   all treatments harbored viable salmonellae that resembled the inoculated   isolates after 4 weeks of incubation. These results demonstrate that   pathogenic salmonellae were isolated from heterogeneous aquatic biofilms   and that they could persist and stay viable in such biofilms in high   numbers for some time.",223,NO,IF,,,,,

Myrmecophilous caterpillars in the Lycaenidae family produce   nitrogen-rich exudates from their dorsal glands to attract ants for   protection, and this phenomenon has been postulated to shape the   caterpillars host-plant choice. Accordingly, it was postulated that   evolution towards myrmecophily in Lycaenidae is correlated with the   utilization of nitrogen-rich host plants. Although our results were   consistent with the evolutionary shifts towards high-nutrient host   plants serving as exaptation for the evolution of myrmecophily in   lycaenids, the selection of nitrogen-rich host plants was not confined   to lycaenids. Butterfly species in the nonmyrmecophilous family Pieridae   also preferred nitrogen-rich host plants. Thus, we conclude that   nitrogen is an overall important component in the caterpillar diet,   independent of the level of myrmecophily, as nitrogen can enhance the   overall insect fitness and survival. However, when nitrogen can be   obtained through alternative means, as in socially parasitic lycaenid   species feeding on ant brood, the selective pressure for maintaining the   use of nutrient-rich host plants is relaxed, enabling the colonization   of nitrogen-poor host plants.",224,NO,IF,,,,,

Shading by these   vascular plants influences abiotic and biotic processes that shape   benthic community assemblages. We present data on the effects of shading   on the California horn snail, Cerithidea californica. This species is   important because it is the most common benthic macrofaunal species in   these systems and acts as an obligate intermediate host of several   species of trematode parasites that infect several other species. Using   observational and experimental studies, we found a negative effect of   shade on the distribution and abundance of the California horn snail. We   hypothesized that shading reduces the abundance of the epipelic diatoms   that the snails feeds on, causing snails to leave shaded areas. We   observed a negative relationship between vascular plant cover,   sub-canopy light levels, and snail density in Mugu Lagoon. Then we   experimentally manipulated light regimes, by clipping vegetation and   adding shade structures, and found higher snail densities at higher   light levels. In Goleta Slough, we isolated the effect of shade from   vegetation by documenting a negative relationship between the shade   created by two bridges and diatom and snail densities. We also found   that snails moved the greatest distances over shaded channel banks   compared to unshaded channel banks. Further, we documented the effect of   water depth and channel bank orientation on shading in this system. An   additional effect of shading is the reduction of temperature, providing   an alternative explanation for some of our results.

Increasing evidence suggests AMF diversity is at least partially   controlled by the identities of plants in the host plant neighborhood.   However, much of this evidence comes from greenhouse studies or work in   invaded systems dominated by single plant species, and has not been   tested in species-rich grasslands. We worked in 67 grasslands spread   across the three German Biodiversity Exploratories that are managed   primarily as pastures and meadows, and collected data on AMF   colonization, AMF richness, AMF community composition, plant diversity,   and land use around focal Plantago lanceolata plants. We analyzed the   data collected within each Exploratory (ALB Schwabische Alb, HAI   Hainich-Dun, SCH Schorfheide-Chorin) separately, and used variance   partitioning to quantify the contribution of land use, host plant   neighborhood, and spatial arrangement to the effect on AMF community   composition. We performed canonical correspondence analysis to quantify   the effect of each factor independently by removing the variation   explained by the other factors. AMF colonization declined with   increasing land use intensity (LUI) along with concurrent increases in   non-AMF, suggesting that the ability of AMF to provide protection from   pathogens declined under high LUI. In ALB and HAI mowing frequency and   percent cover of additional P. lanceolata in the host plant neighborhood   were important for AMF community composition. The similar proportional   contribution of land use and host neighborhood to AMF community   composition in a focal plant rhizosphere suggests that the diversity of   this important group of soil microbes is similarly sensitive to changes   at large and small scales.",226,NO,IF,,,,,

The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) can be divided into two   discrete ecotypes: ``lemming foxes'' and ``coastal foxes''. Crashes   in lemming abundance can result in pulses of ``lemming fox'' movement   across the Arctic sea ice and immigration into coastal habitats in   search for food. These pulses can influence the genetic structure of the   receiving population. We have tested the impact of immigration on the   genetic structure of the ``coastal fox'' population in Svalbard by   recording microsatellite variation in seven loci for 162 Arctic foxes   sampled during the summer and winter over a 5-year period. Genetic   heterogeneity and temporal genetic shifts, as inferred by STRUCTURE   simulations and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions,   respectively, were recorded. Maximum likelihood estimates of movement as   well as STRUCTURE simulations suggested that both immigration and   genetic mixture are higher in Svalbard than in the neighbouring   ``lemming fox'' populations. The STRUCTURE simulations and AMOVA   revealed there are differences in genetic composition of the population   between summer and winter seasons, indicating that immigrants are not   present in the reproductive portion of the Svalbard population. Based on   these results, we conclude that Arctic fox population structure varies   with time and is influenced by immigration from neighbouring   populations.

Previous studies   attributed the asymptotic diversity-productivity pattern to plant   competition and differential resource use (e.g., niche complementarity).   Using an analytical model and a series of experiments, we demonstrate   theoretically and empirically that host-specific soil microbes can be   major determinants of the diversity-productivity relationship in   grasslands. In the presence of soil microbes, plant disease decreased   with increasing diversity, and productivity increased nearly 500\%,   primarily because of the strong effect of density-dependent disease on   productivity at low diversity. Correspondingly, disease was higher in   plants grown in conspecific-trained soils than heterospecific-trained   soils (demonstrating host-specificity), and productivity increased and   host-specific disease decreased with increasing community diversity,   suggesting that disease was the primary cause of reduced productivity in   species-poor treatments. In sterilized, microbe-free soils, the increase   in productivity with increasing plant species number was markedly lower   than the increase measured in the presence of soil microbes, suggesting   that niche complementarity was a weaker determinant of the   diversity-productivity relationship.

Fine roots were   sampled in three 100 x 100-m plots at each study site. Each plot was   subdivided in five 20 x 100-m subplots and 15 soil samples were randomly   taken from a depth of 0-5 cm in soil within each plot.

During the cool season, fine-root   dry mass, fine-root length, incidence and length of root hairs and   intensity of AMF infection decreased compared with the warm season. We   verified that the potential for soil exploration, that expresses the   capacity for nutrient acquisition via fine roots and AMF infection   intensity, decreased during the cool season and with the advance of the   successional groups.

Although much is known about the pathology of parasites,   the environmental factors influencing the distribution and abundance of   parasites are poorly understood. Investigations into these factors could   help predict the effect of parasites on the functioning of ecosystems.   The limpet Patella vulgata is a key grazer on European rocky shores and   is the first intermediate host for the trematode parasite,   Echinostephilla patellae. This study investigated the spatial   distribution of E. patellae in relation to P. vulgata at fourteen rocky   shores around Ireland. Despite P. vulgata recruiting into rock pools,   adults are more abundant on emergent rock and experience greater   mortality in pools compared to emergent rock. It has been suggested that   greater parasite prevalence in pools may be a factor driving this   disjunct distribution pattern. Prevalence of infection was compared   among rock and pool habitats. Size and sex of the host were also   investigated in order to determine whether host phenotype influenced   levels of infection prevalence. Results varied considerably among study   sites, probably due to the heterogeneity of environmental conditions. No   clear pattern emerged in relation to infection prevalence between   habitats but this may be owing to the low numbers of limpets collected   from pools. There was a significant positive relationship between   infection prevalence and increasing host size. Individuals for which sex   was indeterminate were more likely to be infected than distinct males or   females, suggesting that infection may be causing castration and   subsequent removal of these individuals from the breeding population.

Even though bobcats were   often trapped within the urban matrix, FIV transmission events were more   likely to occur in areas with more natural habitat elements. Urban   fragmentation also resulted in lower rates of pathogen evolution,   possibly owing to a narrower range of host genotypes in the fragmented   area.

We employed stable   isotope analysis to investigate energy assimilation patterns as   indicators of abiotic limitation in arid grassland and montane   populations of C. gunnisoni during a multi-year drought. Standard   ellipse areas of plasma and red blood cell carbon (delta C-13) and   nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values, representing population-level   foraging niche widths, declined during years and seasons of drought   stress at both study sites. Prairie dogs at the montane site, but not at   the desert grassland site, maintained seasonal shifts in dietary niche   width corresponding to periods of favorable growth conditions for the   more nutritious C-3 plants.

The issue of   competition for food between these ungulate guilds remains largely   unresolved. Resolving it will provide insights into how wild zebra are   likely to interact with cattle on shared landscapes and suggest best   practices for cattle owners who must decide whether to tolerate wild   ungulates, some of which are severely threatened (e.g. Grevy's zebra,   Equus grevyi).   Aim: Determine whether an equid and a bovid compete in a semi-arid   savanna in Kenya.   Organisms: Boran cattle (Bos indict's) and donkeys (Equus africanus   asinus) the latter as surrogates for zebras.   Methodology: Experiments to measure performance (weight gains), bite   rates, diet quality (digestible organic matter and crude protein), and   gastrointestinal worm burdens (parasite egg count per unit weight of   faeces) of the two ungulate species when herded separately (single   species) or together (mixed species). We used two stocking levels:   low-density (one animal per 7 ha), a level typical of commercial   ranchers: and high-density (one animal per 2 ha), a level typical of   pastoral herders.   Principal findings: When herded together, both species gained more   weight, had higher bite rates (especially at low stocking density), and   selected diets with a more favourable balance between digestible organic   matter and crude protein, than when herded separately. In addition,   parasite egg output in faeces of donkeys was reduced by 14-35\%   following shared foraging with cattle.

We observed that the frequency of bacterial isolates possessing various   plant beneficial properties was significantly higher in the asymptomatic   samples. A total of 39 bacterial isolates showing a minimum of five   beneficial traits related to mineral nutrition [phosphate (P)   solubilization, siderophore production, nitrogen (N) fixation],   development [indole acetic acid (IAA) synthesis], health [production   of antibiotic and lytic enzymes (chitinase)], induction of systemic   resistance [salicylic acid (SA) production], stress relief   [production of 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase] and   production of quorum sensing [N-acyl homoserine lactones] signals were   characterized. A bioassay using ethidium monoazide (EMA)-qPCR was   developed to select bacteria antagonistic to Candidatus Liberibacter   asiaticus. Using the modified EMA-qPCR assay, we found six bacterial   isolates showing maximum similarity to Paenibacillus validus,   Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas putida,   Microbacterium oleivorans, and Serratia plymutica could significantly   reduce the population of viable Ca. L. asiaticus in HLB symptomatic leaf   samples.

Ongoing   continentalization and increasing human population diminish the degree   of isolation of the Galapagos, jeopardizing its socio-ecological system.   While tourism and fisheries activities stand by the islands' economy,   several anthropogenic stressors threaten the marine ecosystem. An   environmental assessment and literature survey were conducted to   characterize the coastal marine pollution impacts caused by human-made   activities. The assessment revealed that municipal waste incineration of   organic waste and plastics in open dump areas is a potential source of   unintentionally produced persistent organic pollutants such as dioxins   and furans. Plastic is one of the most abundant solid wastes at sea and   shorelines, representing 25 \% of the total marine debris.

Oil spills and   traces of hydrocarbons threaten the long-term survival of marine species   due to the current reliance on fuel transported from Ecuador's mainland   coast.

While   taking up resources from the hosts below-ground, they may simultaneously   compete with the hosts for sunlight. Suppression caused by the   parasitism could result in openings in the vegetation structure and   increased mortality levels. On the other hand, the root hemiparasites   may also be constrained by the hosts, restricting the parasites to a   limited number of locations within a community. These vegetation   alterations and location restrictions can be referred to as spatial   signatures of the root hemiparasites. In order to search for such   spatial signatures, we investigated a population of a predominant Acacia   species in Australia co-occurring with established root hemiparasitic   shrubs, using intensity estimates of the Acacia and dead shrubs to be   indicators of parasite populations. We find evidence that the root   hemiparasitic shrubs, like herbaceous root hemiparasites, prefer growing   at distances from neighbouring plants that fulfil resource requirements   both below-ground and above-ground. Assuming that root hemiparasites are   limited by their hosts, we present an optimal host density and distance   to host hypothesis (`Goldilocks hypothesis') to account for such a   vegetation pattern. Although mortality appeared to primarily result from   intraspecific competition and shoot parasitism, the root parasitism   could explain some of the mortality in open areas. It is likely that   both processes occur simultaneously. In spite of differing annual and   perennial life strategies among root hemiparasites, root parasitism   across systems may follow these two general processes in the formation   of vegetation patterns.",238,NO,IF,,,,,

Here, we examined the reciprocal trophic interactions among   populations of the wild cabbage Brassica oleracea that vary greatly in   their production of defensive secondary compounds - glucosinolates   (GSs), a generalist herbivore, Trichoplusia ni, and its polyembryonic   parasitoid Copidosoma floridanum. In a greenhouse environment, plants   were exposed to either healthy (unparasitized), parasitized, or no   herbivores. Feeding damage by herbivores induced higher levels of the   indole GSs, glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin, but not any of the   other measured GSs. Herbivores parasitized by C. floridanum induced   cabbage plants to produce 1.5 times more indole GSs than levels induced   by healthy T. ni and five times more than uninduced plants. As a   gregarious endoparasitoid, C. floridanum causes its host T. ni to feed   more than unparasitized herbivores resulting in increased induction of   indole GSs. In turn, herbivore fitness parameters (including   differential effects on male and female contributions to lifetime   fecundity in the herbivore) were negatively correlated with the   aliphatic GSs, sinigrin and gluconapin, whereas parasitoid fitness   parameters were negatively correlated with the indole GSs,   glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin. That herbivores and their   parasitoids appear to be affected by different sets of GSs was   unexpected given the intimate developmental associations between host   and parasitoid. This study is the first to demonstrate that parasitoids,   through increasing feeding by their herbivorous hosts, can induce higher   levels of non-volatile plant chemical defenses. While parasitoids are   widely recognized to be ubiquitous in most terrestrial insect herbivore   communities, their role in influencing plant-insect herbivore   relationships is still vastly underappreciated.",239,NO,IF,,,,,

Conversely, pathogen transmission and infection may be regulated by   plant community characteristics such as plant species diversity and   functional composition that favor pathogen diversity through increases   in host diversity while simultaneously reducing pathogen infection via   increased variability in host density and spatial heterogeneity.   Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of multi-host multi-pathogen   interactions is of high significance in the context of   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning. We investigated the relationship   between plant diversity and aboveground obligate parasitic fungal   pathogen (''pathogens'' hereafter) diversity and infection in   grasslands of a long-term, large-scale, biodiversity experiment with   varying plant species (1-60 species) and plant functional group   diversity (1-4 groups). To estimate pathogen infection of the plant   communities, we visually assessed pathogen-group presence (i.e., rusts,   powdery mildews, downy mildews, smuts, and leaf-spot diseases) and   overall infection levels (combining incidence and severity of each   pathogen group) in 82 experimental plots on all aboveground organs of   all plant species per plot during four surveys in 2006.   Pathogen diversity, assessed as the cumulative number of pathogen groups   on all plant species per plot, increased log-linearly with plant species   diversity. However, pathogen incidence and severity, and hence overall   infection, decreased with increasing plant species diversity. In   addition, co-infection of plant individuals by two or more pathogen   groups was less likely with increasing plant community diversity. We   conclude that plant community diversity promotes pathogen-community   diversity while at the same time reducing pathogen infection levels of   plant individuals.",240,NO,IF,,,,,

Predators affect prey populations not only through direct predation,   but also by acting as definitive hosts for their parasites and   completing parasite life cycles. Understanding the affects of parasitism   on prey population dynamics requires knowing how their predators'   parasite community is affected by diet and prey availability. Ungulates,   such as moose (Alces americanus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus   virginianus), are often important prey for wolves (Canis lupus), but   wolves also consume a variety of alternative prey, including beaver   (Castor canadensis) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus).   2. The use of alternative prey, which may host different or fewer   parasites than ungulates, could potentially reduce overall abundance of   ungulate parasites within the ecosystem, benefiting both wolves and   ungulate hosts.   3. We examined parasites in wolf carcasses from eastern Manitoba and   estimated wolf diet using stable isotope analysis. Taeniidae cestodes   were present in most wolves (75\%), reflecting a diet primarily   comprised of ungulates, but nematodes were unexpectedly rare.   4. Cestode abundance was negatively related to the wolf's delta C-13   value, indicating diet affects parasite abundance. Wolves that consumed   a higher proportion of beaver and caribou (Rangifer tarandus), estimated   using Bayesian mixing models, had lower cestode abundance, suggesting   the use of these alternative prey can reduce parasite loads.   5. Long-term consumption of beavers may lower the abundance of adult   parasites in wolves, eventually lowering parasite density in the region   and ultimately benefiting ungulates that serve as intermediate hosts.   Thus, alternative prey can affect both predator-prey and host-parasite   interactions and potentially affect food web dynamics.",241,NO,IF,,,,,

Agrobiodiversity is sustained by diversified farming   practices and it also supplies multiple ecosystem services to   agriculture, thus reducing environmental externalities and the need for   off-farm inputs. We reviewed the literature that compares biologically   diversified farming systems with conventional farming systems, and we   examined 12 ecosystem services: biodiversity; soil quality; nutrient   management; water-holding capacity; control of weeds, diseases, and   pests; pollination services; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency and   reduction of warming potential; resistance and resilience to climate   change; and crop productivity. We found that compared with conventional   farming systems, diversified farming systems support substantially   greater biodiversity, soil quality, carbon sequestration, and   water-holding capacity in surface soils, energy-use efficiency, and   resistance and resilience to climate change. Relative to conventional   monocultures, diversified farming systems also enhance control of weeds,   diseases, and arthropod pests and they increase pollination services;   however, available evidence suggests that these practices may often be   insufficient to control pests and diseases or provide sufficient   pollination. Significantly less public funding has been applied to   agroecological research and the improvement of diversified farming   systems than to conventional systems. Despite this lack of support,   diversified farming systems have only somewhat reduced mean crop   productivity relative to conventional farming systems, but they produce   far fewer environmental and social harms. We recommend that more   research and crop breeding be conducted to improve diversified farming   systems and reduce yield gaps when they occur. Because single   diversified farming system practices, such as crop rotation, influence   multiple ecosystem services, such research should be holistic and   integrated across many components of the farming system.

Marine   phages encompass enormous genetic diversity, affect biogeochemical   cycling of elements, and partially control aspects of prokaryotic   production and diversity. Despite their importance, there is a paucity   of data describing virioplankton distributions over time and depth in   oceanic systems. A decade of high-resolution time-series data collected   from the upper 300m in the northwestern Sargasso Sea revealed recurring   temporal and vertical patterns of virioplankton abundance in   unprecedented detail. An annual virioplankton maximum developed between   60 and 100m during periods of summer stratification and eroded during   winter convective mixing. The timing and vertical positioning of this   seasonal pattern was related to variability in water column stability   and the dynamics of specific picophytoplankton and heterotrophic   bacterioplankton lineages. Between 60 and 100 m, virioplankton abundance   was negatively correlated to the dominant heterotrophic bacterioplankton   lineage SAR11, as well as the less abundant picophytoplankton,   Synechococcus. In contrast, virioplankton abundance was positively   correlated to the dominant picophytoplankton lineage Prochlorococcus,   and the less abundant alpha-proteobacteria, Rhodobacteraceae.   Seasonally, virioplankton abundances were highly synchronous with Prochl   orococcus distributions and the virioplankton to Prochlorococcus ratio   remained remarkably constant during periods of water column   stratification. The data suggest that a significant fraction of viruses   in the mid-euphotic zone of the subtropical gyres may be cyanophages and   patterns in their abundance are largely determined by Prochlorococcus   dynamics in response to water column stability.

They include mycorrhizal fungi and   nitrogen-fixing bacteria, together with the soil microbial populations   which contribute to nutrient availability. Around 70\% of jarrah forest   plant species form arbuscular mycorrhizas, and approximately a quarter   also form ectomycorrttizas. Many are also legumes. In addition, around   70 orchid species depend on mycorrhizal symbioses. Therefore, symbiotic   soil microorganisms are important in the ecosystem. Arbuscular   mycorrhizal fungi recover to pre-mining levels in bauxite restoration in   five years. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are poorly adapted to disturbance;   however, they are able to reinvade through wind-blown spores. The   density of ectomycorrhizal fungi has been found to be equivalent in   seven-year-old restoration and adjacent forest, but both abundance and   diversity are correlated with development of a litter layer.   Fortunately, rhizobia are known to be tolerant of soil disturbance, and   failure of N-fixation by legumes has not been reported in restoration.   Other N-fixing symbioses, such as between Allocasuarina and Frankia or   Macrozamia and Nostoc, have not been investigated in restored mines.   Soil microbial biomass C achieves near equivalence after about eight   years and appears to be driven by vegetation productivity and related   inputs of C into the soil. There is little field evidence that the   absence, or very low levels, of soil microbial symbionts will have a   substantial impact on plant growth in restoration. Therefore, deliberate   reintroduction of these microorganisms does not appear justified.   However, soil management to enhance the survival of soil biological   components is recommended.",245,NO,IF,,,,,

Using legacy and recent data from 3180 drilled, felled, and cored stems   in mixed dipterocarp forests in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, we quantified   the frequency and severity of stem rot in a total of 339 tree species,   and related variation in stem rot with tree size, wood density,   taxonomy, and species' soil association, as well as edaphic conditions.   Predicted stem rot frequency for a 50 cm tree was 53\% of felled, 39\%   of drilled, and 28\% of cored stems, demonstrating differences among   methods in rot detection ability. The percent stem volume infected by   rot, or stem rot severity, ranged widely among trees with stem rot   infection (0.1-82.8 \%) and averaged 9\% across all trees felled. Tree   taxonomy explained the greatest proportion of variance in both stem rot   frequency and severity among the predictors evaluated in our models.   Stem rot frequency, but not severity, increased sharply with tree   diameter, ranging from 13\% in trees 10-30 cm DBH to 54\% in stems >= 50   cm DBH across all data sets. The frequency of stem rot increased   significantly in soils with low pH and cation concentrations in topsoil,   and stem rot was more common in tree species associated with dystrophic   sandy soils than with nutrient-rich clays. When scaled to forest stands,   the maximum percent of stem biomass lost to stem rot varied   significantly with soil properties, and we estimate that stem rot   reduces total forest AGB estimates by up to 7\% relative to what would   be predicted assuming all stems are composed strictly of intact wood.   This study demonstrates not only that stem rot is likely to be a   significant source of error in forest AGB estimation, but also that it   strongly covaries with tree size, taxonomy, habitat association, and   soil resources, underscoring the need to account for tree community   composition and edaphic variation in estimating carbon storage in   tropical forests.",246,YES,IF,biomass,YES,,,

We test the hypotheses that the   change in canopy species composition is based (1) on climate-driven   performance only, (2) on fire only, or (3) on fire-performance   interactions. We show that the evergreen conifers Picea obovata and   Abies sibirica are the natural late-successional species both in central   and eastern Siberia, provided there has been no fire for an extended   period of time.

Habitat destruction and increasing land use intensity result in   habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and subsequently in the   loss of species diversity. The fact that these factors are often highly   confounded makes disentangling their effects extremely difficult, if not   impossible, and their relative impact on species loss is mostly   speculative.   2. In a two-year study, we analysed the relative importance of changed   landscape composition (increased areas of cropped habitats), reduced   habitat connectivity and reduced habitat quality on nest colonization of   cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids. We selected 23 pairs   of conventional and organic wheat fields in the centre of landscape   circles (500 m radius) differing in edge densities (landscape   configuration) and \% non-crop habitats (landscape composition).   Standardized trap nests were established in the field centres and in   neighbouring permanent fallow strips (making a total of 92 nesting   sites).   3. Factors at all three scales affected nest colonization. While bees   were enhanced by high proportions of non-crop habitat in the landscape,   wasps profited from high edge densities, supporting our hypothesis that   wasps are enhanced by connecting corridors. Colonization of   herbivore-predating wasps was lower in field centres than in fallow   strips for conventional sites, but not for organic sites, indicating a   fallow-like connectivity value of organic fields. The relative   importance of habitat type and farming system varied among functional   groups suggesting that their perception of crop-non-crop boundaries or   the availability of their food resources differed.   4. Local and landscape effects on parasitoids were mainly mediated by   their hosts. Parasitism rates were marginally affected by local factors.   A specialist parasitoid was more sensitive to high land use intensity   than its host, whereas generalist parasitoids were less sensitive.   5. We conclude that the conversion of cropland into non-crop habitat may   not be a sufficiently successful strategy to enhance wasps or other   species that suffer more from isolation than from habitat loss.   Interestingly, habitat connectivity appeared to be enhanced by both   higher edge densities and by organic field management.

We formulate a consumer-resources model   for a terrestrial ecosystem that incorporates resource diversity in the   form of multiple species of resources (for example trees, grasses or   both) and the consumers of those resources. This model is used to   explore a potential benefit of maintaining ecosystem biodiversity,   namely reducing the spread of infectious diseases. The important   mathematical features of the model are derived, analysed and used to   investigate our hypothesis that increasing species diversity in the   resources can reduce diseases in those resources. The results of the   analyses and numerical simulations suggest that indeed increasing   resource diversity can lead to a decrease in infectious diseases. Of   more interest, we show how increased diversity can result in eradication   of disease in cases where disease persistence would normally be   predicted.",251,NO,IF,,,,,

Though   parasites comprise nearly half of marine species, their responses to   these important forces remain little explored. We quantified parasite   assemblages at two spatial scales, across a gradient in productivity and   fishing pressure that spans six coral islands of the Line Islands   archipelago and within the largest Line Island, Kiritimati, which   experiences a west-to-east gradient in fishing pressure and   upwelling-driven productivity. In the across-islands data set, we found   that increasing productivity was correlated with increased parasite   abundance overall, but that the effects of productivity differed among   parasite groups. Trophically transmitted parasites increased in   abundance with increasing productivity, but directly transmitted   parasites did not exhibit significant changes. This probably arises   because productivity has stronger effects on the abundance of the   planktonic crustaceans and herbivorous snails that serve as the   intermediate hosts of trophically transmitted parasites than on the   higher-trophic level fishes that are the sole hosts of directly   transmitted parasites. We also found that specialist parasites increased   in response to increasing productivity, while generalists did not,   possibly because specialist parasites tend to be more strongly limited   by host availability than are generalist parasites. After the effect of   productivity was controlled for, fishing was correlated with decreases   in the abundance of trophically transmitted parasites, while directly   transmitted parasites appeared to track host density; we observed   increases in the abundance of parasites using hosts that experienced   fishing-driven compensatory increases in abundance. The within-island   data set confirmed these patterns for the combined effects of   productivity and fishing on parasite abundance, suggesting that our   conclusions are robust across a span of spatial scales. Overall, these   results indicate that there are strong and variable effects of   anthropogenic and natural drivers on parasite abundance and taxonomic   richness. These effects are likely to be mediated by parasite traits,   particularly by parasite transmission strategies.",252,NO,IF,parasite abundance,,,,

If   reefs become stuck' within a self-reinforcing state dominated by   seaweed, it becomes disproportionately difficult and expensive for   managers to shift the system back towards its natural, productive, coral   state. The existence of multiple attractors is controversial. We assess   various forms of evidence and conclude that there remains no   incontrovertible proof of multiple attractors on reefs. However, the   most compelling evidence, which combines ecological models and field   data, is far more consistent with multiple attractors than the competing   hypothesis of only a single, coral attractor. Managers should exercise   caution and assume that degraded reefs can become stuck there. Testing   for the existence of alternate attractors in ecosystems that possess   slow dynamics and frequent pulse perturbation is exceptionally   challenging. Coral reefs typify such conditions and the existence of   alternate attractors is controversial. We analyse different forms of   evidence and assess whether they support or challenge the existence of   multiple attractors on Caribbean reefs, many of which have shown   profound phase shifts in community structure from coral to algal   dominance. Field studies alone provide no insight into multiple   attractors because the non-equilibrial nature of reef dynamics prevents   equilibria from being observed. Statistical models risk failing to   sample the parameter space in which multiple attractors occur, and have   failed to account for the confounding effects of heterogeneous   environments, anthropogenic drivers (e.g. fishing), and major   disturbances (e.g. hurricanes). Simple and complex models all find   multiple attractors over some though not all regions of a system driver   (fishing). Tests of model predictions with field data closely match   theory of alternate attractors but a forward-leaning monotonic curve   with only a single attractor can also be fitted to these data. Deeper   consideration of the assumptions of this monotonic relationship reveal   significant ecological problems which disappear under a model of   multiple attractors. To date, there is no evidence against the existence   of multiple attractors on Caribbean reefs and while there remains no   definitive proof, the balance of evidence and ecological reasoning   favours their existence. Theory predicts that Caribbean reefs do not   exhibit alternate attractors in their natural state but that   disease-induced loss of two key functional groups has generated   bistability. Whether alternate attractors becomes a persistent element   of reef dynamics or a brief moment in their geological history will   depend, in part, on the ability of functional groups to recover and the   impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on coral growth and   mortality.",253,NO,IF,,,,,

Locationertoryje National Nature Reserve, Bile Karpaty (White   Carpathians) Protected Landscape Area, Czech Republic.   MethodsWe conducted a before-after-control-impact experiment in meadow   patches heavily infested by C.epigejos: eight blocks, each containing   four plots with four treatment combinations: (1) traditional management,   i.e. mowing once in summer, (2) mowing in summer and autumn (3) mowing   in summer and seed sowing of R.major, (4) mowing in summer and autumn   and seed sowing of R.major. Above-ground biomass of C.epigejos and   vegetation composition of each of the plots were monitored every year   from 2013 to 2016. To assess the effects of treatments, we analysed   biomass production of C.epigejos, herb layer cover and vegetation   composition.   ResultsBoth sowing R.major and an additional autumn meadow cut   significantly suppressed C.epigejos. Their effects were additive and of   comparable size. Both treatments also had significant but markedly   different effects on community composition. Rhinanthus major facilitated   directional community composition change towards the regional   Brachypodio-Molinetum meadows. In contrast, increased mowing intensity   significantly decreased frequency of threatened species, which however   may have also been influenced by R.major.   ConclusionsSowing of autochthonous R.major seeds was demonstrated as an   efficient tool to suppress C.epigejos and facilitate community   restoration. It can be combined with an additional meadow cut to further   accelerate decline of the grass. The additional cut should however be   used as a short-term practice (1-2years) only to minimize potential   negative effects of its long-term application on some threatened plant   species. The effects of R.major are comparable to those of Rhinanthus   alectorolophus reported previously.

Among the   most sensitive taxa to these changes are scleractinian corals, which   engineer the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Corals' sensitivity is   a consequence of their evolutionary investment in symbiosis with the   dinoflagellate alga, Symbiodinium. Together, the coral holobiont has   dominated oligotrophic tropical marine habitats. However, warming   destabilizes this association and reduces coral fitness. It has been   theorized that, when reefs become warm and eutrophic, mutualistic   Symbiodinium sequester more resources for their own growth, thus   parasitizing their hosts of nutrition. Here, we tested the hypothesis   that sub- bleaching temperature and excess nitrogen promotes symbiont   parasitism by measuring respiration (costs) and the assimilation and   translocation of both carbon (energy) and nitrogen (growth; both   benefits) within Orbicella faveolata hosting one of two Symbiodinium   phylotypes using a dual stable isotope tracer incubation at ambient (26   degrees C) and sub- bleaching (31 degrees C) temperatures under elevated   nitrate. Warming to 31 degrees C reduced holobiont net primary   productivity (NPP) by 60\% due to increased respiration which decreased   host \% carbon by 15\% with no apparent cost to the symbiont.   Concurrently, Symbiodinium carbon and nitrogen assimilation increased by   14 and 32\%, respectively while increasing their mitotic index by 15\%,   whereas hosts did not gain a proportional increase in translocated   photosynthates. We conclude that the disparity in benefits and costs to   both partners is evidence of symbiont parasitism in the coral symbiosis   and has major implications for the resilience of coral reefs under   threat of global change.",255,YES,IF,symbiont becomes parasite,YES,,,

A workshop was held that year to address this issue. In the   last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in human traffic to the   Antarctic and the number of commercial tourists visiting the Antarctic   has steadily risen. Personnel of national science programmes, though   relatively few in numbers, have the most intimate contact with wildlife   and thus the greater potential to introduce organisms through their   research activities. Many visitors are now able to arrive in the   Antarctic from temperate regions within hours by aircraft, and from   northern polar regions within 24 to 36 hours. Tourists, by their high   numbers, also have the potential to transfer infectious disease agents   among commonly visited sites. As of 2009, no outbreaks of infectious   diseases in the Antarctic reported in the literature have been directly   attributed to human activity, but the ameliorating climate may break   down the barriers that have kept Antarctic wildlife relatively free of   infectious diseases. Several agents of infectious diseases reported in   Antarctic seabirds and seals are assessed for their likelihood to occur   more frequently in terms of the characteristics of the agent, the   behaviour of Antarctic wildlife, and the effects of an ameliorating   climate (regional warming) in conjunction with continued increasing   human activities.",256,NO,IF,,,,,

Controlling exotic diseases across large expanses of   forest has proven difficult, but fire may reduce the levels of diseases   that are sensitive to environmental conditions. We examined Cornus   florida populations in burned and unburned Quercus-Carya stands to   determine if burning prior to anthracnose infection has reduced the   impacts of an exotic fungal disease, dogwood anthracnose, caused by   Discula destructiva. We hypothesized that fire has altered stand   structure and created open conditions less conducive to dogwood   anthracnose. We compared C. florida density, C. florida health, and   species composition and density among four sampling categories: unburned   stands, and stands that had burned once, twice, and 3 times over a   20-year period (late 1960s to late 1980s). Double burn stands contained   the greatest density of C. florida stems (770 stems ha(-1)) followed by   triple burn stands (233 stems ha(-1)), single burn stands (225 stems   ha(-1)) and unburned stands (70 stems ha(-1); P < 0.01). We observed   less crown dieback in small C. florida trees (< 5 cm diameter at breast   height) in burned stands than in unburned stands (P < 0.05). Indicator   species analysis showed that burning favored species historically   associated with Quercus-Carya forests and excluded species associated   with secondary succession following nearly a century of fire   suppression. Our results suggest that fire may mitigate the decline of   C. florida populations under attack by an exotic pathogen by altering   forest structure and composition. Further, our results suggest that the   burns we sampled have had an overall restorative effect on forest   communities and were within the fire return interval of the historic   fire regime. Consequently, prescribed fire may offer a management tool   to reduce the impacts of fungal disease in forest ecosystems that   developed under historic burning regimes.",257,NO,IF,,,,,

In the face of global environmental challenges the   utilization of this information in ecological monitoring contexts has   been called for, but examples remain sparse. This can be attributed to   the significant technical challenges in processing this data and   concerns about the quality, reliability and applicability of information   mined from social media to the ecological domain.   Here the strength and weaknesses of social media mining for ecological   monitoring are assessed using the micro-blogging service Twitter and   invasive alien species (IAS) monitoring as an example. The assessment is   based on a manual analysis of 2842 Tweets sampled from Twitter data with   potential direct or descriptive references to IAS impacting forest   ecosystems, which was collected over a period of nearly three years. The   results are presented as information topologies for Twitter messages of   observational and non-observational character for three IAS with   distinctive characteristics (Oak Processionary Moth, Emerald Ash Borer,   Eastern Grey Squirrel). The results show that the social media channel   Twitter is a rich source of primary and secondary observational   biodiversity information. It also provides useful insights in the   topical landscape of public communications on IAS as well as the public   perception of IAS and IAS management. The analysis suggests broad   application opportunities in IAS monitoring and management, and points   at applications for related environmental questions. The results   highlight that social media mining for ecological monitoring needs to be   approached with the same best practices as ecological monitoring in   general, requiring a good understanding of the monitored subjects and   specific monitoring questions.   The challenges in utilizing this information for operational systems are   of technical rather than conceptual nature and include extending the   degree of automation, especially with regard to image recognition and   the automatic provisioning of location information.

Ubiquitous environmental stressors are often thought to alter animal   susceptibility to pathogens and contribute to disease emergence.   However, duration of exposure to a stressor is likely critical, because   while chronic stress is often immunosuppressive, acute stress can   temporarily enhance immune function. Furthermore, host susceptibility to   stress and disease often varies with ontogeny; increasing during   critical developmental windows. How the duration and timing of exposure   to stressors interact to shape critical windows and influence disease   processes is not well tested.   2. We used ranavirus and larval amphibians as a model system to   investigate how physiological stress and pathogenic infection shape   development and disease dynamics in vertebrates. Based on a resource   allocation model, we designed experiments to test how exposure to   stressors may induce resource trade-offs that shape critical windows and   disease processes because the neuroendocrine stress axis coordinates   developmental remodelling, immune function and energy allocation in   larval amphibians.   3. We used wood frog larvae (Lithobates sylvaticus) to investigate how   chronic and acute exposure to corticosterone, the dominant amphibian   glucocorticoid hormone, mediates development and immune function via   splenocyte immunohistochemistry analysis in association with ranavirus   infection.   4. Corticosterone treatments affected immune function, as both chronic   and acute exposure suppressed splenocyte proliferation, although viral   replication rate increased only in the chronic corticosterone treatment.   5. Time to metamorphosis and survival depended on both corticosterone   treatment and infection status. In the control and chronic   corticosterone treatments, ranavirus infection decreased survival and   delayed metamorphosis, although chronic corticosterone exposure   accelerated rate of metamorphosis in uninfected larvae. Acute   corticosterone exposure accelerated metamorphosis increased survival in   infected larvae.   6. Interactions between stress exposure (via glucocorticoid actions) and   infection impose resource trade-offs that shape optimal allocation   between development and somatic function. As a result, critical disease   windows are likely shaped by stress exposure because any conditions that   induce changes in differentiation rates will alter the duration and   susceptibility of organisms to stressors or disease.",260,NO,IF,,,,,

These traits were measured on individuals reared in a common garden   experiment at two different food levels, as allocation trade-offs may be   easier to detect under energy shortage. Edge individuals had a faster   larval life history (growth and development rates), a higher adult   immune function and a nearly significant higher relative flight muscle   mass. Most of the differentiation between core and edge populations   remained and edge populations had a higher relative flight muscle mass   when corrected for latitude-specific thermal regimes, and hence could   likely be attributed to the range expansion process per se. We here for   the first time document a higher immune function in individuals at the   expansion front of a poleward-expanding species and documented the   rarely investigated evolution of faster life histories during range   expansion.

We examined foliar levels of lignin, soluble phenolics,   monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpenoids in 12 stands in   British Columbia, Canada. We used these data to assess associations   among foliar secondary metabolite levels and ecosystem, geographic, and   climatic variables. Regressions were also performed to observe which   combinations of variables best explained secondary metabolite variance.   Stands of P. c. latifolia in the Coastal Western Hemlock and Interior   Cedar/Hemlock biogeoclimatic zones had consistently greater foliar   levels of almost all measured secondary metabolites than did other   stands. Lignin was present in greater amounts in Boreal White/Black   Spruce ecosystem (i.e., northern) stands than in southern stands,   suggesting a role for this metabolite in pine survival in the boreal   forest. Attempts to develop regression models with geographic and   climatic variables to explain foliar secondary metabolite levels   resulted in multiple models with similar predictive capability. Since   foliar secondary metabolite levels appeared to vary most between stand   ecosystem types and not as much due to geographic and climatic   variables, metabolic profiles appeared best matched to the stress levels   within local environments. It is unknown if differences in secondary   metabolite levels are the result of genetic adaptation or phenotypic   plasticity, but results from this and other studies suggest that both   are important.

Negative effects on individual plant performance are widely documented,   but less is known about whether such effects translate into effects on   population viability. In temperate forests, important herbivores include   deer. During 2006-2009, I compared vital rates and population growth   rates (calculated using integral projection models) between fenced   exclosures and grazed control areas, using the perennial herb Phyteuma   spicatum as a model species. Deer caused the largest damage to flowering   individuals, removing about 24\% of all inflorescences and 13\% of the   above-ground biomass. Only few vital rates seemed to be negatively   affected by deer (mainly seed production) and this did not translate   into effects on population growth rate. Contrary to expectations,   population growth rates tended to be lower in the fenced exclosures in 1   year. This was likely caused by high-pathogen infestation rates, which   negatively affected the probability of adult survival and growth.   Population growth rate was more sensitive to changes in these vital   rates than to changes in seed production. In summary, the results of   this demographic study show that grazing effects may be small for   long-lived herbs, and that negative effects on vital rates such as seed   production may not always translate into effects on population growth   rate. The findings also illustrate that other antagonists such as   pathogens may be of greater relative importance for differences in   population performance than herbivores.",263,YES,IF,,yes,,,

Additionally, no significant relationship was   observed between temperature variability and MHC diversity. Although   lake basin was the largest driver of differences in MHC diversity, our   results also demonstrate that fine-scale differences in water   temperature may generate variable selection regimes in populations that   spawn in habitats separated by as little as 1km. Additionally, our   results indicated that some populations may be reaching a maximum level   of MHC diversity.

As the diversity and abundance of insects on a single   plant are determined by characteristics of the environment as well as of   the host plant, it is difficult to predict how insects associated with a   single plant species will change during succession. We examined how   plant characteristics of the early successional plant species ragwort   (Jacobaea vulgaris), and the herbivores and parasitoids associated with   these plants change during secondary succession. In ten grasslands that   differed in time since abandonment (3-26 years), we measured the size   and primary and secondary chemistry of individual ragwort plants. For   each plant we also recorded the presence of herbivores in flowers,   leaves and stems, and reared parasitoids from these plant parts. Ragwort   plants were significantly larger but had lower nitrogen concentrations   in recently abandoned sites than in older sites. Pyrrolizidine alkaloid   (PA) composition varied among plants within sites but also differed   significantly among sites. However, there was no relationship between   the age of a site and PA composition. Even though plant size decreased   with time since abandonment, the abundance of stem-boring insects and   parasitoids emerging from stems significantly increased with site age.   The proportion of plants with flower and leaf herbivory and the number   of parasitoids emerging from flowers and leaves was not related to site   age. Parasitoid diversity significantly increased with site age.

To rigorously quantify the interrelationship between food web   structure, the types of species in a web and the distinct types of   feeding links between them, we introduce a shared methodology to   quantify the structural roles of both species and feeding links. Roles   are quantified based on the frequencies with which a species (or link)   appears in different food web motifs - the building blocks of networks.   We hypothesized that different types of species (e.g. top predators,   basal resources, parasites) and different types of links between species   (e.g. classic predation, parasitism, concomitant predation on parasites   along with their hosts) will show characteristic differences in their   food web roles. We found that parasites do indeed have unique structural   roles in food webs. Moreover, we demonstrate that different types of   feeding links (e.g. parasitism, predation or concomitant predation) are   distributed differently in a food web context. More than any other   interaction type, concomitant predation appears to constrain the roles   of parasites.

We examined   whether systemic fungal endophytes modulate recycling of nutrients   directly by altering litter decomposition. We studied litter   decomposition mediated by Epichloe endophytes in litter-bag experiments.   We examined direct endophyte effects on litter decomposition in wild   populations and cultivars of Schedonorus phoenix and Schedonorus   pratensis. In the first experiment, endophyte presence tended to   increase litter decomposition rate in cultivars of the two grass species   (S. phoenix and S. pratensis). However, in the second experiment plant   origin had a stronger influence than endophyte symbiosis in S. phoenix.   Interestingly, the initial level of alkaloids was associated positively   with decomposition in S. phoenix populations. Characteristics associated   with litter quality were not clearly related to either endophytes or   decomposition rate. Our results suggest that endophytes can enhance   litter breakdown but their role in nutrient cycling is far more complex   depending on plant population origin.

In this study, clone pairs (endophyte-infected, endophyte-free) of two   tall fescue genotypes received factorial combinations of increased   temperature (+3 degrees C) and precipitation (+30\% long-term annual   mean) for 2 yr. We measured root arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF),   dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonization, and soil AMF extraradical   hyphae (ERH) length. We hypothesized that genetically distinct grass-E.   coenophiala associations would differentially affect belowground fungi,   and that these relationships would be climate-sensitive. Tall fescue   genotype, endophyte presence, and climate treatment interactions   affected AMF arbuscules, vesicles, and ERH. DSE decreased with E.   coenophiala presence but increased with warming.

Soil nematodes   are a highly important component of desert ecosystem functioning, but   rely on water films formovement. However, it is currently poorly   understood how different trophic groups of nematodes respond to chronic   presses as well as short-lived pulses of altered water availability,   especially in arid systems where such changes are expected to have the   greatest impact. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of both   instantaneous and long-term variation in water availability on desert   soil nematode trophic groups. We hypothesized that nematode abundance   would respond positively to both short-and long-term increases in   moisture. Based on the ecology of the different trophic groups we   further made predictions about their relative rates of response. We   increased or decreased precipitation from ambient levels in the   Chihuahuan Desert for four consecutive years and sampled soil nematodes   after two, three and four years. We tested the effects of altered   precipitation treatments through time as well as gravimetric soil   moisture at the time of sampling on the abundance of the different   nematode trophic groups. In contrast to our hypotheses, the abundances   of most nematode trophic groups were unaffected by the amount of   precipitation, even after four years of altered precipitation.   Plant-parasitic nematodes from low moisture soils were the only group   that reacted positively to increased precipitation from the third year   onwards. Trophic groups responded differently to soil moisture, with   bacterivores decreasing with increasing moisture and omnivores showing a   positive relationship that diminished over time. We show that in   general, these desert nematodes were not limited by precipitation, and   were highly resilient to decreases therein. However, when also   considering the effects of soil moisture, some more complex patterns and   differences among trophic groups emerged. We discuss potential   mechanisms explaining these observations and contrast our findings with   those from other ecosystems around the world. We conclude that deserts   harbor nematode communities that seem more resilient to altered water   availability than other ecosystems.",269,NO,IF,,,,,

The mycorrhizal association is normally mutualistic   and can provide a number of benefits to the host plant including   increased nutrient uptake, improved water relations, and protection from   pathogens. However, conventional agricultural practices have been shown   to have a negative impact on the abundance and diversity of AM fungi.   The use of more diverse and sustainable land use practices such as   tree-based intercropping can have the potential to reduce the negative   impact of agricultural practices on AM fungi. This paper reviews the   literature to investigate the effect of temperate and tropical   tree-based intercropping systems on the abundance and diversity of AM   fungi. Evidence from these studies suggests that tree-based   intercropping systems support a more abundant and diverse AM fungal   community compared to conventionally managed systems. However, there are   studies that observed zero or negative significant effects on the AM   fungal community as a result of incorporating trees into agricultural   systems. The variable effect of tree-based intercropping systems on AM   fungi observed may be a function of the different cultivation   techniques, climatic variation, or diverse tree-crop combinations used   within the different tree-based intercropping systems. To further our   understanding of AM fungal dynamics in tree-based intercropping systems,   future research should focus on the influence of tree species with   varying mycorrhizal associations and the functional role of common   mycelial networks in these systems, while utilizing applicable molecular   techniques.

Dalgleish",2017,The implications of American chestnut reintroduction on landscape   dynamics and carbon storage,ECOSPHERE,NA,NA,10.1002/ecs2.1773,"In the eastern United States, American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was   historically a major component of forest communities, but was   functionally extirpated in the early 20th century by an introduced   pathogen, chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica). Because chestnut   is fast-growing, long-lived, and resistant to decay, restoration of   American chestnut using blight-resistant stock could have the potential   to increase carbon sequestration or storage in forested landscapes.   However, carbon dynamics are also affected by interspecific competition,   succession, natural disturbance, and forest management activities, and   it is unknown how chestnut restoration might interact with these other   processes. We used the PnET-Succession extension of the LANDIS-II forest   landscape model to study the implications of chestnut restoration on   forest composition and carbon storage in the context of other   disturbances, including timber harvest and insect pest outbreaks. Our   results imply that it could take a millennium or more for chestnut to   fully occupy landscapes without aggressive restoration efforts. When   successful, chestnut restoration activities displaced other species   approximately in proportion to their abundance on the landscape, rather   than replacing a single species or genus (e.g., Quercus). Insect pests   increased the rate of chestnut colonization by reducing the abundance of   competitors, and also had a dominant effect on carbon dynamics. Although   chestnut is fast-growing, moderately shade-tolerant, and decomposes very   slowly, our results suggest that it can only modestly increase the   carbon storage potential of eastern forests. However, our results also   demonstrate that compositional changes in forest communities can have   noticeable effects on biomass accumulation, even with the large   uncertainties introduced by invasive pests.",271,NO,IF,,,,,

The emerald ash borer (EAB) Agrilus   planipennis Fairmaire is an invasive phloem-feeding beetle that has   killed tens of millions of ash Fraxinus trees in North America since   first detected in 2002. We evaluated populations of immature EAB life   stages and associated natural enemies over a 7-year period (2008-2014)   in six stands of eastern deciduous forest in southern Michigan, where   Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang and two other Asian-origin EAB   parasitoids were released for biological control between 2007 and 2010.   We observed approximate to 90\% decline in densities of live EAB larvae   in infested ash trees at both parasitoid-release and control plots from   2009 to 2014 and found no significant differences in EAB density or   mortality rates by parasitoids, avian predators or other undetermined   factors between parasitoid-release and control plots. The decline in EAB   larval density in our study sites was correlated with significant   increases in EAB larval parasitism, first by native parasitoids, then by   T.planipennisi. Life table analyses further indicated that parasitism by   the introduced biocontrol agent and the North American native   parasitoids contributed significantly to the reduction of net EAB   population growth rates in our study sites from 2010 to 2014.Synthesis   and applications. Our findings indicate that successful biocontrol of   emerald ash borer (EAB) may involve suppression of EAB abundance both by   local, generalist natural enemies (such as Atanycolus spp.) and by   introduced specialist parasitoids (such as T.planipennisi). Biological   control programmes against EAB in the aftermath of invasion should focus   on establishing stable populations of T.planipennisi and other   introduced specialist parasitoids for sustained suppression of   low-density EAB populations. Moreover, we recommend releasing the   introduced specialist biocontrol agents as soon as possible to prevent   the outbreak of EAB populations in both newly infested and aftermath   forests when EAB densities are still low.
